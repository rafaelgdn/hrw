Another twelve deaths are reliably reported but their names not confirmed. Following the demonstration, which was to demand the withdrawal of oil companies operating in Nigeria, Military Administrator of Bayelsa State declared a state of emergency, imposed a dusk to dawn curfew, and banned all meetings. At least twelve demonstrators were arrested and taken to an army camp outside Port Harcourt.  """"This is a serious backward step for Nigeria,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has been moving the country in the right direction, but these killings and the declaration of a state of emergency in Bayelsa State raise concerns that the current government is returning to the repressive methods used by the Abacha regime.""""  Human Rights Watch called for the government to establish an immediate inquiry into the shootings and to discipline or charge those responsible, as appropriate; to release or charge before the ordinary courts those arrested; and to respect the rights of Nigerian citizens to internationally guaranteed rights to freedom of assembly, association and expression. Human Rights Watch called on the oil companies operating in Nigeria to urge the government to exercise restraint and abide by its obligations to respect international human rights law.  The youths shot dead were among those demonstrating in different communities across the Ijaw areas of the Niger Delta in support of the """"Kaiama Declaration"""" adopted by Ijaw youths on December 11. The Declaration stated that any oil company employing the services of the Nigerian security forces would be """"viewed as an enemy of the Nigerian people"""" and advised oil company staff and contractors to withdraw from Ijaw territory by December 30. The youths demanded that all multinational oil companies should """"extinguish their flares and withdraw from Ijawland"""" by January 1, 1999. The latest shootings of unarmed demonstrators are part of a pattern of abuses against those protesting the activities of the oil companies operating in the Niger Delta.","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

In violation of Mexican labor law, maquiladora operators oblige women to undergo pregnancy testing as a condition of work. Women thought to be pregnant are not hired.  Among the corporations engaging in this practice, which violates both Mexican and international law, are such international corporations as Landis & Staefa, Samsung Group, Matsushita Electric Corp., Sunbeam-Oster, Sanyo, Thomson Corporate Worldwide, Siemens AG, and Pacific Dunlop. However, the vast majority of companies engaging in this practice are U.S.-owned, including Lear, Johnson Controls, and Tyco International. The Human Rights Watch report, """"A Job or Your Rights: Continued Sex Discrimination in Mexico's Maquiladora Sector,"""" documents how companies demand that women produce urine specimens for pregnancy exams and how maquiladora doctors and nurses examine women's abdomens or require them to reveal private information about menses schedule, birth control use, and sexual activity as a means to determine pregnancy. """"This is flagrant sex discrimination that these corporations would never dare to defend or practice in their own countries,"""" said Regan Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"When corporations say that this discrimination is permissible under Mexican labor law, they are in fact hiding behind Mexico's own negligence.""""  The Mexican government claims that pregnancy testing does not violate its law and fails to recognize the extent of on-the-job pregnancy discrimination. The Mexican government has fallen back on weak legalisms to defend the practice of pregnancy testing. The U.S. government is holding consultations on this issue under the labor rights side agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (nafta). In these consultations, Mexico has argued that the existing prohibitions against sex discrimination do not cover pregnancy testing--an assertion that many Mexican lawyers strenuously reject. The Mexican government has also argued that the provisions against sex discrimination apply only to job holders, not to job applicants.  """"The Mexican government's defense is weak and phony,"""" said Ralph. """"It is reinterpreting Mexican law to suit its case."""" The Mexican government has also argued that women who suffer discrimination on the job need only come forward and report the incidents in order to attain redress. The Human Rights Watch report shows that the adjudicative and investigative structures charged with receiving these cases are biased, underresourced, and inconsistent about how the law should be enforced on this matter. """"The Mexican government has abandoned women workers to the discriminatory employment practices of maquiladora operators,"""" explained Ralph. """"Women are left having to choose between a job and their rights, and the Mexican government is on the wrong side of that choice.""""  The report also shows how pregnancy discrimination follows women into their jobs. For example, some maquiladoras require women to take pregnancy exams even once they are on the job as a condition of continued work. Some maquiladoras, such as Germany-based Siemens and U.S.-based Lear Corp. and National Processing Company go so far as to require women workers to report to factory infirmaries to show their used sanitary napkins as incontrovertible proof that they are not pregnant. The latest report describes the cases of fifty-three women who faced either hiring-process pregnancy discrimination or on-the-job pregnancy discrimination in fifty factories in Tijuana, in the state of Baja California (south of San Diego, California); Reynosa and Río Bravo, in the state of Tamaulipas (opposite McAllen, Texas); and Ciudad Juárez (across the border from El Paso, Texas). Additionally, the report contains extensive recommendations to the Mexican and U.S. governments, corporations, and subcontractors aimed at ending pregnancy discrimination in the maquiladoras. Human Rights Watch calls on Mexico to take immediate action to end pregnancy discrimination in the hiring process and on the job; make remedial measures available for women who face hiring-process pregnancy discrimination; and ensure that existing mechanisms fully investigate, condemn, and punish on-the-job pregnancy discrimination. Human Rights Watch further calls on corporations in the maquiladora sector to end the practice of requiring women to provide information on pregnancy status as a condition to gain or maintain work, including requiring women workers to show used sanitary napkins to keep their jobs and establish mechanisms, independent of the factories, to monitor these changes.","Americas, Mexico","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Child Labor, Domestic Workers"

Those tensions are being fueled by the Habibie government's reluctance to allow a discussion of independence in a """"national dialogue"""" on Irian Jaya originally planned for January and now likely to be postponed. Human Rights Watch takes no position on the political status of Irian Jaya but believes that the government should not attempt to restrict the content of any discussion on political options.   The tension has also been fueled by a series of pro-independence actions since July 1998 that has led to the imprisonment of dozens of activists. A demonstration in Biak on July 6 resulted in the army's opening fire on demonstrators; the exact death toll remains unclear today.   """"If demands for a thorough investigation into the Biak shooting and other recent abuses are not met, many people in Irian Jaya are going to get angrier,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"That will only increase the potential for unrest in the region.""""   The report released today, """"Human Rights and Pro-Independence Actions in Irian Jaya,"""" describes the background to the pro-independence demonstrations in July and October 1998 in Jayapura, Sorong, Wamena, Biak, and Manokwari. It looks in particular at the Biak demonstration and at the army's use of lethal force there. It then examines the arrest of six pro-independence leaders in late September, and how the debate over a national dialogue has exacerbated the already tense atmosphere.   """"The situation is similar to East Timor,"""" said Jones. """"The government, by restricting freedom of expression to advocate independence, has made the concept of autonomy seem like little more than continuation of the status quo. In both East Timor and Irian Jaya, the effect of banning discussion on one popular option is simply to increase support for it.""""","Asia, Indonesia",""

Meas Minear and Kim Sen, staff members of the Cambodian human rights organization Licadho, were arrested on December 21 after they monitored demonstrations and received complaints from citizens in Sihanoukville angered about the dumping of industrial material thought to be toxic. The waste had been shipped from Taiwan to a site about fifteen kilometers from Sihanoukville. """"These arrests send an ominous message about the Cambodian government's commitment to respecting basic human rights. Human rights workers must be allowed to do their jobs,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Unless there is evidence that the two workers committed criminal activities, defined as such by international standards, they should be immediately released."""" On December 21 at 10:15 a.m., Licadho staffperson Kim Sen was arrested by ten policemen, who surrounded a coffeeshop where he and two other Licadho employees were eating. On the same day at 10:45 a.m., Licadho staffperson Meas Minear was arrested by two policemen who entered the Licadho offices in Sihanoukville. Both Licadho employees were taken to the Provincial Police Commissariat, where they were held for five hours. No warrants, summons, or other forms of written documentation were provided to either men at the time of their arrest, and lawyers and local and international human rights workers were denied access to them while they were detained at the Police Commissariat. At 3:30 p.m., the two rights workers and a Sihanoukville market vender who was arrested the same day were transferred to the Sihanoukville Provincial Court, where they were interrogated by an investigating judge. The judge told the three that they were charged with robbery, wrongful damage of property, and participating in a demonstration. After interviewing the three men, the judge dropped the third charge, of participating in a demonstration. At 6:15 p.m. that evening, the three men were transferred to the Sihanoukville provincial prison, accompanied by two truckfuls of armed policemen.  Several hundred people including students, market vendors, and dock workers conducted protests in Sihanoukville on December 20 and 21 about the toxic dumping, which has been widely reported in the domestic and international press in Cambodia. Some of the demonstrations turned violent, as mobs ransacked and looted the homes and offices of local officials whom they held responsible for allowing the waste to be imported from Taiwan. Cambodian human rights workers were present during the demonstrations in a monitoring capacity, and also helped citizens file complaints about the toxic dumping. """"These arrests will have a chilling effect not only on human rights organizations and their ability to do their work, but on the general population in feeling free to exercise their freedoms to assembly and association, rights that are enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Cambodia is a party,"""" said Jones.","Asia, Cambodia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/12/21/ins-violates-rights-detained-children","INS Violates Rights of Detained Children","INS Violates Rights of Detained Children","","12/21/1998","While most children around the country are celebrating the season's holidays at home with their families, this week hundreds of children in the custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) will be spending Christmas in detention, separated from family and loved ones. In a new report released today, Human Rights Watch charges the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) with violating the rights of unaccompanied children in its custody. The report finds that roughly one-third of detained children are held in punitive, jail-like detention centers, even though most children in INS custody are being detained for administrative reasons while their case is pending, not as a punishment for criminal behavior. Approximately 5000 unaccompanied children are detained by the INS each year. Human Rights Watch focused its report on a Pennsylvania facility that the INS claims is one of the best in the country. However, the report found that too many children are locked up in prison-like conditions with juveniles accused of murder, rape and drug trafficking, where they are forbidden to speak their native language, instructed not to laugh, and, according to several interviewees, even forced to ask permission to scratch their noses. Human Rights Watch found that some children are strip searched and restrained by handcuffs during transport, and denied basic rights to privacy. """"These children have not been charged with any crime,"""" says Jo Becker, an author and researcher for the report. """"Yet a significant number are being locked up in harsh, prison-like conditions where they are unable to communicate with anyone around them. Many don't understand what is happening to them, or why."""" The report also charges the INS with failing to provide children with adequate information about access to legal representation or their legal rights, and transferring children without the knowledge of their attorneys or families. Many children are denied information about their detention or education in a language that they can understand and may be confined for months at a time without direct access to a single person with whom they can converse in their own languages. Human Rights Watch also charges that the INS has a troubling conflict of interest, since children are subject to the enforcement of immigration laws by the same agency responsible for their care and protection. Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. government to end this conflict of interest by assigning the care-taking function to an appropriate child welfare agency, which would have custody of the child while the INS assesses their immigration status. """"These children are arrested, imprisoned and frequently deported, all by the same agency that is charged with caring for them and protecting their legal rights,"""" says Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. government should assign the care of these children to an agency that will act in the best interest of the child."""" The report, Detained and Deprived of Rights: Children in the Custody of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, is based on on-site visits and interviews conducted at the Berks County Youth Center in Leesport, Pennsylvania. An earlier Human Rights Watch investigation documented conditions of detention for children held by the INS in Arizona and California. Both investigations found numerous violations of children's rights, in breach of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. statutory provisions, INS regulations, the terms of court orders binding on the INS, and international law. Human Rights Watch calls on U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and INS Commissioner Doris Meissner to ensure immediate and full compliance with all national laws and regulations as well as with internationals tandards concerning detention conditions for children. The organization also urges that: *unaccompanied children awaiting determination of their status should not be detained, except in rare instances to protect the safety of the child; *the INS immediately cease to place unaccompanied children in state juvenile justice or criminal justice facilities, or in other facilities with prison-like conditions; *the US Congress should not charge the same agency with the care of unaccompanied, undocumented children and also the enforcement of the immigration laws against them; *all children in INS custody should have access to legal representation at government expense; *children should receive prompt, regular and thorough legal information in a language they can understand; *the INS should provide a sufficient number of trained interpreters at facilities housing unaccompanied children, as required by the shifting language populations in the facilities.","United States","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

""""China's signature on a human rights treaty isn't worth the paper it's written on if this is what it does to peaceful political activists,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights last October in a move that many governments welcomed as an indication of Beijing's growing commitment to international human rights principles. Xu Wenli, fifty-five, was given a thirteen-year sentence on Monday, and Wang Youcai, thirty-two, received an eleven-year term following his trial last Thursday. The verdict in the trial of a third activist, Qin Yongmin, has not yet been announced. All three men were involved in trying to set up the Chinese Democracy Party, and all three were accused of attempting to subvert the government. """"China says it respects freedom of expression, but then arrests these men for calling for democratic change,"""" said Jones. """"It says it respects freedom of association, but then arrests virtually everyone associated with a new political party. It says it respects the rights of defendants, but then applies the principle of verdict first, trial second."""" Human Rights Watch said that under the circumstances, it was time for governments now engaged in """"human rights dialogues"""" with China--including the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and the E.U.--to rethink what purpose these dialogues were serving. """"We have no problem with seminars on law and justice,"""" said Jones, """"but if the Chinese government persists in ignoring law and denying justice, the governments holding these seminars better look for a more forceful way of raising human rights concerns with Beijing."""" Human Rights Watch is urging governments to bring a resolution condemning China's human rights practices at the annual meeting in Geneva of the U.N. Human Rights Commission this coming March. This past April the effort was abandoned in favor of the less confrontational dialogues. Human Rights Watch urged China's dialogue partners to make immediate, high-level appeals toBeijing for a commutation of the sentences handed down to Xu and Wang and to suspend any high-level trade delegations scheduled to visit China in early 1999 in protest against the harsh sentences.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

The university administration's order prevents students, professors, and researchers throughout Serbia from accessing a website from OpenNet, the Internet branch of Belgrade's independent Radio B92. On December 10, the new government-appointed dean of the School of Electrical Engineering, Vlada Teodosic, ordered """"filters"""" to prevent users of the Yugoslav academic Internet network from accessing the OpenNet website, a major source of independent news and information. The measure also affects the independent media and nongovernmental organizations in the country, many of which access OpenNet through the university. """"OpenNet has played a central role in breaking the government's information blockade,"""" said Human Rights Watch academic freedom specialist Joseph Saunders. """"President Milosevic and his allies are spearheading a direct assault on the free flow of information.""""  The act of censorship comes as the latest step in an ongoing attack on the universities by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. In May 1998, a new university law stripped Serbian universities of their autonomy and required all professors to sign new contracts within sixty days regardless of the terms of existing contracts and guarantees of tenure. Professors who refused to sign the new contracts, viewed by many as loyalty oaths to the government, have been harassed, suspended, and fired. Teodosic, who has authority over the computing center at the University of Belgrade, has been a central figure in academic repression. In October, he suspended twelve engineering professors who refused to sign the new """"contracts,"""" including professors such as Branko Popovic, with nearly 150 publications to his name and awards from several international scientific societies. Teodosic hired private security guards to forcibly remove any of the twelve professors who attempted to return to their classrooms. The attack on the Internet also comes amidst increased government harassment of the independent media in Serbia. A new Law on Information, passed on October 20, established a system of prior censorship and imposes prohibitively high fines on journalists, editors, and publishers; three newspapers have been shut down thus far. The immediate motive for blocking OpenNet access appears to have been a link on the website to a political cartoon that showed Teodosic in a Nazi uniform giving a Nazi salute. The cartoon also portrayed another newly-appointed administrator, Milos Laban, as a monkey. The OpenNet site also hosts detailed, regularly updated information on the conflict between academics and the government, and includes letters of support for Serbian academic freedom from academics and universities around the world.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","Free Speech"

The letter, identifying the use of children as soldiers as """"one of the most alarming and tragic trends in modern warfare,"""" was signed by the leaders of forty human rights, religious, peace, humanitarian, child welfare, veterans and professional organizations. The leaders express deep disappointment at U.S. opposition to United Nations efforts to establish eighteen as the minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict. The United States opposition is based on current U.S. practice which allows the voluntary recruitment of seventeen-year olds, with parental permission.  Signers of the appeal include Dr. David Pruitt, president of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Dr. William Schulz, executive director of Amnesty International USA, Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, Rev. Dr. Joan Brown Campbell, general secretary of the National Council of Churches, Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, Randall Robinson, president of TransAfrica, Charles Lyons, president of the US Committee for UNICEF, Robert Muller, president of the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, and Rear Admiral Eugene Carroll Jr., U.S. Navy (retired). """"Robbed of their childhood, child combatants are subjected to a cycle of violence that they are often too young to understand, or resist,"""" states the letter. """"While many of these young recruits may start out as porters or messengers, too often they end up on the front lines of combat. Some are used for particularly hazardous duty, such as entering mine fields ahead of older troops, or undertaking suicide missions. Some have been forced to commit atrocities against family members or relatives. Inexperienced and immature, these children suffer far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts. Those who survive are often physically or psychologically scarred. Typically lacking an education or civilian job skills, their futures are often bleak."""" Experts estimate that more than 300,000 children under the age of eighteen are currently participating in more than thirty armed conflicts around the world.  In October, the U.S. Congress passed a resolution, introduced by Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN), calling on the United States not to block international efforts to establish eighteen as the minimum age for participation in armed conflict. The United Nations working group negotiating the proposed international agreement will convene for its next session in Geneva in January.  The letter's signers note that setting a minimum age of eighteen for recruitment or participation in armed conflict would be consistant with existing international norms that guarantee children under the age of eighteen special care and protection. Such standards include the nearly-universally ratified Convention on the Rights of the Child, international treaties prohibiting children from hazardous labor, and other protective legislation. A new policy recently announced by the United Nations Secretary General sets eighteen as the minimum age for UN peacekeepers.","United States","Children's Rights"

It noted that the Chinese government is on the verge of sending another to prison for openly challenging one-party rule: on Monday, veteran dissident Xu Wenli is to be tried on subversion charges in Beijing.   """"We're delighted that Mr. Liu has regained his freedom but sorry that he can only enjoy it in exile,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """" We also condemn this latest round of China's cynical hostage politik, with Mr. Liu being released just as another outspoken activist is locked up.""""   Mr. Liu, whose biodata is attached, has spent the last three years in a labor camp for campaigning for greater political openness in a series of petitions to Chinese authorities and for advocating the right to freedom of association for workers. His name has been on innumerable prisoner lists brought to China by visiting foreign leaders. It is typical of the Chinese government response on such matters that he is being released after his term is up anyway, and that the release comes just as international criticism was building in response to the arrest of Mr. Xu and two other political activists. All three are facing heavy sentences for trying to set up an alternative political party called the Chinese Democracy Party. The timing of Mr. Liu's release may thus be a deliberate effort by Chinese authorities to dilute that criticism.   There is concern that of the three CDP activists, Xu Wenli, Qin Yongmin, and Wang Youcai, Mr. Xu may have the dubious honor of replacing Mr. Liu as the next hostage around whom international attention will focus.   """"In this case, we have one release for three arrests,"""" said Jones. """"That's a net deterioration, by any objective standard."""" Human Rights Watch has insisted that the fact that China has now signed two major human rights treaties should not silence public protest of China's human rights practices. One of those treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, guarantees freedom of association and expression. It was the peaceful exercise of precisely those rights that led to the imprisonment not only of Liu Nianchun but also the three CDP activists.   LIU NIANCHUN   Liu Nianchun, a forty-nine-year-old labor activist, has spent almost seven years in prison. His latest term began on May 21, 1995 when he was sentenced to three year's reeducation through labor for working with other dissidents to organize petitions to be sent to the National People's Congress for rectification of human rights abuses. He was charged with organizing an illegal organization, publishing works critical of the government in overseas publications, and having contact with counterrevolutionary groups overseas. He was also accused of accepting contributions from such organizations. His sentence was extended for another six months in May 1997 by Chinese authorities who said he had not reformed his thought. He was reportedly tortured when he protested the extension.   From May 1995, when he was taken into custody, until July 4, 1996, Liu's family had no idea of where he was being held. His wife was finally informed that her husband was detained in Tuanhe Labor Camp in a suburb of Beijing.   Liu Nianchun had been detained twice before. From 1981 until 1984, he was imprisoned because of activities on behalf of his brother, Liu Qing, a human rights activist now living in exile in New York. (He is chair of Human Rights in China.) Liu Qing had been sentenced in 1979 to a ten-year sentence for his pro-democracy advocacy, and Liu Nianchun helped smuggle out his prison writings. In 1994, he was imprisoned for over seven months after organizing a labor rights group called the League for the Protection of the Rights of the Working People. The League called for the restoration of the right to strike and the legalization of independent peasants' and workers' unions. It noted the problems caused by rapid economic growth in China and warned that a rising gap between rich and poor combined with widespread corruption could lead to social unrest unless such unions were permitted.   Liu Nianchun has also taught Chinese at a Beijing middle school.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Xu Wenli is expected to go on trial on Monday at 9 a.m. local time, and Human Rights Watch urges the international community to insist that the proceedings be open to the international press and diplomatic corps. Wang and Qin were tried Thursday, December 17 before only a small number of ticketed observers. All three men were charged with subversion in connection with their efforts to form a political opposition group called the Chinese Democracy Party (CDP).   """"To arrest and try these men as subversives, when their only offense has been to advocate peaceful political change in China, flies in the face of all the commitments on human rights that the Chinese government has made to the world over the last two years,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The government is systematically violating the right to freedom of expression and association not only of these three, but of hundreds of others detained for related activities."""" She urged China's trading partners to immediately implement the following steps:  Governments engaged in bilateral dialogues with the Chinese government should suspend meetings planned for the immediate future as a protest against the crackdown on the CDP. Those meetings include the U.S.-China dialogue scheduled for early January and the official China-E.U. dialogue in February.  Governments currently engaged in conducting legal seminars should inform the Chinese government that its disregard of international legal norms in the arrest and trial of these activists threatens the future of these seminars.  Governments should summon the Chinese ambassador to their respective countries to protest China's defiance of international law.  Governments should call on Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to intervene at the highest levels to call for the men's releases.  The treatment of the CDP activists has violated numerous articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which China signed in October 1998 and has yet to ratify. Among the most important are:   Freedom of association (Article 22)   Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin were all accused in connection with their peaceful efforts to establish the China Democracy Party. Those efforts should have been fully protected by the right to freedom of association. Freedom of expression (Article 19), including """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art or any other media...""""   The charges against Wang Youcai include using e-mail to send abroad materials of the China Democracy Party.   Right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal (Article 14), including the right to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of a defense and to communicate with counsel of one's own choosing. The courts that tried the two men are not independent, and the trials of Wang and Qin, although billed as open, clearly were not. Only three family members were permitted at each trial. Advance tickets were required for all others. No international observers were present despite their requests to attend. Xu Wenli's wife has been given one ticket for her husband's trial on Monday.   In terms of access to counsel, police had advised attorneys for both Wang and Qin that it would not be in their best interests to represent the activists. Wang's lawyer finally resigned from the case after he was briefly detained four times in four days and told he would only be allowed to plead for leniency. Wang's wife was denied permission to act as her husband's representative, on the grounds that she had a conflict of interest in representing him. Both defendants entered """"not guilty"""" pleas and represented themselves, but were denied permission to coherently present their cases.   Even if legal counsel had been obtained, there was no time for defense preparation. Wang was indicted on November 30; Qin, who was not even detained until December 1, was notified of his trial date only three days before it began, instead of the ten days in advance required by Chinese law. A request by Qin's family for postponement of the trial until a lawyer could be hired was denied. Xu Wenli's lawyer had his first meeting with his client on Thursday, December 17, for a trial which is to start on Monday.

Initial reports suggest that many potential targets are in urban areas, where the risk of civilian deaths and destruction is high. The laws of war require the United States to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Because the U.S. and British forces have precision-guided weapons in their arsenals, no unguided weapons should be used in attacks on urban areas.  """"The burden is on Clinton and Blair to take extraordinary precautions in urban settings,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"No dumb bombs should be dropped on Baghdad, or other populated areas."""" The laws of war prohibit the destruction of objects that are indispensable to the survival of a civilian population. Roth noted that the attacks on the electrical system during the 1991 Gulf War produced massive civilian casualties and little military advantage. """"The Gulf War bombing of Iraq's electrical system is a good example of what must not happen again,"""" Roth said. Since many of the alleged chemical and biological weapons sites are civilian facilities such as hospitals, fertilizer plants, breweries, and pharmaceutical and pesticide plants, the potential for deadly mistakes is high.  """"The decision to attack dual-use sites should be taken only after all efforts have been made to verify that the site is in fact being used for military purposes,"""" said Roth. """" Even then civilians on site should be given effective advance warning of an imminent attack."""" The possible release of dangerous substances during an attack should also be weighed heavily, he said. Human Rights Watch noted that in the past, the Iraqi government has used civilians to shield its military sites -- a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law on the part of Baghdad. But such actions in no way diminish the separate obligation of the U.S. and the U.K. to avoid harm to civilians. """"Knowing that shielding is a possibility, the American and British militaries should pay special attention to this obligation,"""" said Roth. """"Advance warnings are imperative."""" In November, when U.S.-U.K. bombings seemed imminent, Human Rights Watch sent letters to Clinton and Blair urging them to take extra precautions to avoid civilian casualties in Iraq. A copy of the letters is attached. Although the U.S. and the U.K. have incorporated many international humanitarian law provisions into their military guidelines, the organization noted that allied forces in the 1991 Gulf War did not always fully comply with these requirements, as detailed in Human Rights Watch's lengthy report, Needless Deaths in the Gulf War. The organization called on both governments to put in place mechanisms to review continuously the selection of targets and the means and methods used to carry out attacks, and to ensure that possible violations of these standards are investigated immediately and vigorously. A prompt public accounting of the findings should be made, and appropriate disciplinary or prosecutorial measures should be taken against those found responsible for any breach.  The organization also urged the U.S. and U.K., given their special responsibilities as parties to this conflict, to use their influence to persuade all countries bordering Iraq to accommodate any refugee flows resulting from an attack and to refrain from forcibly returning such people to Iraq.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

Akbar Ganji, the editor of the recently-banned weekly newspaper Rah-e No (New Way), was approached by two unknown men as he was leaving his office in Tehran at 6:10 p.m. local time on December 13. Ganji had been held incommunicado for three months in early 1998 for criticizing government policies. The men asked him, """"Where can we find Akbar Ganji?""""

The report is a year-long investigation accompanied by a series of powerful color photographs providing further evidence of malign neglect and inhuman treatment. Entitled """"Abandoned to the State: Cruelty and Neglect in Russian Orphanages,"""" the report documents that """"children in state custodial institutions are deprived of basic human rights at every stage of their lives.""""  """"The abuse in orphanages cannot simply be attributed to Russia's economic crisis,"""" said Kathleen Hunt, author of the Human Rights Watch report. """"The problem of scarce resources does not justify the appalling treatment children receive at the hands of the state. It wouldn't take more money for Russia to change these policies immediately.""""  Hunt said that many of these children do not need to be institutionalized at all, but could be better cared for at home, or in foster homes, at considerably less expense. """"The population of these orphanages is far too high and it's growing,"""" said Hunt, noting that about 200,000 children live in state institutions in Russia. Beginning with infancy, orphans classified as disabled are segregated into """"lying down"""" rooms of the nation's 252 """"baby houses,"""" where they are changed and fed but are bereft of stimulation and lacking in medical care.  Those who are labeled retarded or """"oligophrenic"""" (small-brained), face another grave and consequential violation of their rights around the age of four. At that time, a state commission diagnoses them as """"ineducable,"""" and warehouses them for life in """"psycho-neurological internats."""" After this diagnosis, it is virtually impossible for an orphan to appeal the decision. According to official statistics, some 30,000 children are confined to these locked and isolated institutions, which are little better than prisons.  The orphans may be restrained in cloth sacks, tethered to furniture, denied stimulation and are sometimes left to lie half-naked in their own filth. In both """"baby houses"""" and """"internats,"""" children may be administered powerful sedatives without medical orders. In a throwback to the abhorrent abuse in Soviet psychiatric institutions, orphans and institution staff also told Human Rights Watch of cases when children who tried to run away were sent to a psychiatric hospital for punishment or treatment. Not only disabled orphans suffer violations of their rights in Russian state orphanages, according to Human Rights Watch. Even 'normal' abandoned children---whom the state evaluates as intellectually capable of functioning on a higher level---may be beaten, locked in freezing rooms for days at a time, or sexually abused. Public humiliation was one of the forms of punishment recorded by Human Rights Watch in interviews with children from three different regions of Russia. """"The teacher would punish children by bringing everyone into the classroom, and then making the ones who did something wrong get undressed and stand in front of the open window when it was very cold,"""" according to an orphan interviewed in St. Petersburg. """"Several children would be stripped and have to stand like that while the others had to watch...as a threat,"""" the orphan said. Official statistics indicate that children have been abandoned to the state at a rate of 113,000 for the past two years. This figure is up dramatically from 67,286 in 1992. Human Rights Watch points out the wide variation among state institutions and cites an independent program in one psycho-neurological internat that has made remarkable progress with disabled children.  Among its recommendations to Russian authorities and international community, the human rights organization calls for the state to """"immediately take steps to end the gross neglect, and the physical and psychological abuse by staff working in the custodial institutions of the three ministries involved: Health, Education, and Labor and Social Development."""" The report also urges the state to develop humane alternatives to huge custodial institutions by reallocating existing resources to more family-based care.

Human Rights Watch called upon the international community to take immediate and forceful steps to ensure that the Yugoslav government allows for unimpeded investigations into humanitarian law violations in Kosovo. On several occasions, the Yugoslav authorities have also interfered with the work of investigators for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). ICTY investigators have repeatedly been denied visas and have been barred by Yugoslav authorities from carrying out investigations in Kosovo.   """"Once again, the outlaw government of Milosevic is showing that it will not cooperate with the world in bringing war criminals to justice,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is unacceptable. The international community must vigorously protest these serious incidents of non-compliance and insist on immediate and total cooperation with both the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and the Finnish forensic investigators.""""   The 19-member Finnish forensic team has been meticulous in seeking the required permissions from Serb and Yugoslav authorities. The team, which is sponsored by the European Union, has obtained permission from Yugoslav authorities and the local courts to exhume six sites in Kosovo: Gornje Obrinje, Orahovac, Golubovac, Glodjane, Klecka, and Volujak. These sites contain the bodies of victims of alleged humanitarian law violations by both the Yugoslav forces and the insurgent Kosovo Liberation Army.   On Thursday, December 10, the forensic team attempted to travel to the Gornje Obrinje grave site, but were prevented from reaching the site by a convoy of about ten armored personnel carriers manned by heavily armed members of the Serb police. The Serb police insisted on accompanying the forensic team to Gornje Obrinje, which is located deep within territory currently under the control of the KLA.   Gornje Obrinje was the scene of one of the most serious killings of ethnic Albanian civilians by Yugoslav forces during the Serbian forces' seven-month offensive against the KLA in Kosovo. Human Rights Watch researchers were present in Gornje Obrinje shortly after the bodies were discovered. A detailed investigation by Human Rights Watch has established that twenty-one unarmed members of the Delijaj family, most of them women, children, and the elderly, were killed by Yugoslav forces at Gornje Obrinje. Most of the persons were killed at close range, and several of the bodies had been mutilated. A timely forensic investigation, coupled with the witness testimonies gathered by Human Rights Watch and other investigators, could play an important role in bringing the perpetrators of this horrible crime to justice. A Human Rights Watch researcher was at the massacre site yesterday, waiting in vain to meet and brief the Finnish team.   The Serb police insisted that the team be accompanied by a Serb court official and members of a Belgrade-based forensic team, and refused to allow the team to proceed without police escort, which the leaders of the forensic team did not want, out of fear of provoking a confrontation with the KLA. During a two-hour negotiation between the forensic team and the Serb police, a plainclothes policeman violated the diplomatic immunity of Finnish ambassador Timothy Lahelma by opening the doors of his diplomatic vehicle, grabbing his camera, and removing the film from the camera. According to members of the forensic team interviewed by Human Rights Watch, police repeatedly attempted to shelter their armored vehicles from a KLA attack by moving them behind diplomatic vehicles belonging to the EU contingent of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM). Anticipating a confrontation between the KLA and the Serb police, the forensic team decided to abandon its attempt to reach Gornje Obrinje.   Human Rights Watch calls upon the international community to take immediate steps to ensure that the Finnish forensic team, as well as ICTY investigators, are granted full and unimpeded access to the entire Kosovo region.   """"The Yugoslav authorities are deeply implicated in war crimes in Kosovo and cannot be allowed to dictate the circumstances under which investigations take place,"""" stated Cartner. """"The international community has mistakenly allowed the issue of war crime investigations to be sidelined in its negotiations with Belgrade.

""""Human rights should not be subordinated to security concerns, but that is exactly what is happening,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Torture, unfair trial, and many other serious violations have become the norm in the pursuit of security."""" On Monday President Clinton will have an excellent opportunity to raise these concerns at a meeting of the Palestinian National Council in the Gaza Strip, and at subsequent meetings with both Israeli and Palestinian officials during his three-day trip. Since signing the Wye River Memorandum on October 23, the Palestinian Authority has conducted mass arrests of political opponents, restricted journalists' ability to report on public opinion, and issued a vaguely-worded presidential decree making it a criminal offense to """"insult"""" religion, """"incite"""" the public to break Palestinian government treaties and agreements, and establish """"illegal organizations to practice and promote crime and chaos.""""  Meanwhile, Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights have also continued or in some cases increased. They include the systematic use of torture; arbitrary detention; house demolition; and the imposition of closures and other restrictions on freedom of movement.  """"This visit presents a major opportunity for President Clinton to affirm publicly that the United States will not tolerate human rights violations by either party for the sake of security considerations,"""" Megally said. """"Continued U.S. silence on human rights violations will only encourage further abuses."""" Megally also expressed concern over the prominent role given to the Central Intelligence Agency in monitoring the Memorandum's implementation. The CIA has in the past frequently tolerated gross human rights violations by security forces and groups it monitored or aided and has itself been implicated in human rights violations. He called on Clinton to ensure that U.S. representatives monitoring the memorandum's implementation not be limited to CIA personnel, and include individuals with human rights expertise.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Israel/Palestine",""

UNICEF estimates that as many as 10,000 children have been abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army in its attempt to overthrow the Ugandan government. Children as young as eight years old are forced to raid and loot villages, to fight in LRA front lines against the Ugandan army, and to fight against the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Sudan's civil war. Children are also forced to participate in the brutal killings of other children who are caught trying to escape. Recent reports indicate that the LRA may now be using children to fight in the Congo, on the government side. After her own daughter Charlotte was abducted in October of 1996, Ms Atyam helped found the Concerned Parents Association, a group of Ugandan parents that has worked for the release of children in rebel captivity.  """"Angelina has given voice to thousands of families whose children have been stolen,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"She has worked tirelessly to bring international attention to the devastating plight of these children. Now the international community must act to ensure that the abductions stop, and that the captive children are released."""" Ms. Atyam has raised her concerns directly with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, U.S. First Lady Hillary Clinton, representatives of the Sudan government, members of the U.S. Congress, and United Nations agencies. Her activism led to the passage in October of a U.S. congressional resolution, sponsored by Senator Paul Wellstone, urging U.S. support for efforts to end the abduction of Ugandan children, and to end the use of child soldiers worldwide. The resolution also calls on the U.S. administration to give up its opposition to international efforts to establish eighteen as the minimum age for participation in armed conflict. In April the U.N. Human Rights Commission passed a resolution condemning the abductions and calling on member states to exert all possible pressure on the LRA to release captive children. The resolution also calls for an end to support or assistance, direct or indirect, which furthers the LRA's abduction and detention of children, and for the U.N. system to address this issue as a matter of priority. """"Child soldiers are often invisible,"""" said Whitman. """"To award the UN prize to one of their strongest advocates will help bring critical attention to this global problem.""""

When the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was signed fifty years ago, the U.S. government and its representative, Eleanor Roosevelt, could properly claim to have inspired the human rights movement. Fifty years later, the U.S. government stands in the way of further progress on human rights, said Kenneth Roth, the Executive Director of Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"The United States likes to think of itself as a leader in the field of human rights,"""" said Roth. """"But on some of the key human rights issues of our time, the U.S. lags behind. That's a sad realization on this celebratory anniversary."""" Roth called a system of international justice """"the next big step"""" in human rights protection, and urged the U.S. government to drop its opposition to the proposed international criminal court. The court will investigate and prosecute future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The treaty was passed this summer in Rome, with 120 nations approving the final text. The United States was one of only seven nations to vote against the treaty. Some U.S. government officials have threatened to campaign against the court if the treaty is not altered to significantly weaken the court's powers. """"We've won the first part of the battle: putting human rights on the agenda,"""" said Roth. """"But the world lacks instruments for human rights enforcement. The international criminal court will mark some important progress in that direction - if the United States doesn't undermine the court before it even gets started."""" Roth also urged the U.S. government to publicly support efforts to extradite the Chilean ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. """"In this emerging system of international justice, Pinochet's arrest plays an historic role,"""" said Roth. """"Several European governments have openly supported Pinochet's extradition. Why won't Washington do the same?"""" Roth noted that U.S. opposition has also slowed progress on an international protocol raising the minimum age to join a military force to 18. Although a large majority of countries support the protocol on child soldiers, the Clinton administration wants to limit the minimum age to seventeen, because the U.S. armed forces still recruit a small number of 17-year-olds every year. New research shows that 300,000 children worldwide are participating in armed combat. """"If the U.S. weren't standing in the way, changing the minimum age to eighteen would be a relatively easy task,"""" said Roth. """"With U.S. opposition, countless more children are put at risk."""" Roth also noted that the treaty against anti-personnel landmines was gaining signatories despite U.S. reluctance to join the ban. The Clinton administration announced this past year that the United States might sign the treaty in 2006. """"The landmines treaty was negotiated without the United States and is moving forward without the United States,"""" said Roth. """"This experience shows that in important international law on human rights issues, the United States may simply be left behind."""" In marking the fifitieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Roth noted that fifty years ago, governments did not routinely comment on each other's human rights performance, as they do now, and few watchdogs groups monitored and reported on human rights internationally. Roth also noted that the Declaration originally was applied largely for the benefit of political dissidents, but was now being interpreted to extend to many more social groups.

The body of Iranian poet, writer, and free expression advocate Mohammad Makhtari was found today in a Tehran city morgue, Human Rights Watch said. Marks on his head and neck made it appear that he had been murdered, possibly by strangulation, although no autopsy has yet been carried out. This was the most recent of a series of deaths under suspicious circumstances of prominent critics of the Iranian government. Makhtari, who had last been seen alive on December 3, going to a local shop, was briefly arrested with five other writers in October 1998. The four were threatened with being charged with organizing """"an underground political group"""" if they did not stop holding informal gatherings of writers.  Morgue workers reported the presence of Mohammad Makhtari's body to his family just two weeks after the body of another prominent writer and political critic Majid Sharif was found dumped there on November 24, after """"disappearing"""" on November 20. Sharif's articles criticizing government polices appeared in a monthly magazine, Irane Farda (Iran's Tomorrow), which was closed down by court order just three days ago.

On October 14, the Serbian government announced a general amnesty for """"crimes related to the conflict in Kosovo."""" The Serbian parliament declared that no one would be prosecuted for crimes related to the conflict, """"except for crimes against humanity and international law."""" Despite these promises, large numbers of ethnic Albanians remain in custody and Human Rights Watch has no information that anyone arrested during the conflict has been released as a result of this amnesty. The most recent Serbian government figures, from October 3, state that 684 ethnic Albanians have been arrested for committing or supporting """"terrorism."""" But local and international human rights groups believe the actual number is closer to 1,500. Detained individuals include human rights activists, doctors, humanitarian aid workers, and lawyers, many of whom were physically abused. Five individuals are known to have died in detention since July 1998 from the violence inflicted on them by the police or prison guards. Hundreds of others have been injured from beatings with rubber batons and torture, including the use of electric shock. """"The accusation of ‘terrorism' has cast a wide legal net around many ethnic Albanians, for whom there is no evidence of contact with the KLA, or of criminal conduct,"""" said Ms. Cartner. """"Simply being an Albanian in Kosovo is enough to merit an arrest and torture."""" The Serbian government has obstructed efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit detainees, especially those in pre-trial detention, despite Security Council resolutions mandating full access. Similarly, lawyers and family members have difficulty visiting their clients and relatives in prisons and police stations. Trials began in September and are continuing through the winter. In addition to the use of torture to extract confessions, defendants are often denied access to a lawyer, not allowed to view court documentation, or refused permission to present witnesses on their own behalf. Human Rights Watch also documents illegal detentions committed by the KLA. Estimates of ethnic Serbs and Albanians abducted by the KLA range from 100 to 300, but it is not known whether these people have fled the region, are in hiding, have been killed, or are currently in KLA custody. The ICRC has been denied access to KLA detainees, which raises additional concerns for their safety. The KLA has released some people from detention, such as thirty-five ethnic Serbs captured during fighting in Orahovac in July. On November 27, two ethnic Serbian journalists with the state-run Tanjug press agency were released after spending more than one month in custody. Their trial by a KLA military court did not meet international standards of due process, and they were denied visits by the ICRC and family members. In addition to its recommendations to the Yugoslav government and the KLA, Human Rights Watch urges the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission actively to monitor the treatment of those in detention through regular visits to prisons and police stations.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/12/07/letter-osce","Letter to OSCE","Letter to OSCE","","12/07/1998","Human Rights Watch strongly supports OSCE efforts to monitor human rights observance in Kazakstan, and welcomes the strong statement of concern issued as a result of the November 16-20 ODIHR assessment mission to that country.  We write to you today to share a summary of findings of an ongoing field investigation which strongly suggests that the presidential elections in Kazakstan scheduled for January 10, 1999 represent a perversion of the democratic process. This vote, and the manipulation of candidate registration and campaigning which have preceded it, are not a sudden departure from a record of democratic reforms, as some have maintained, but are fully in keeping with the government of Kazakstan's seven-year record of subverting, canceling or postponing elections, dissolving parliament, and ruling by presidential decree. We wish to share here fresh documentation of Kazakstan's violations of its citizens' civil and political rights, and to suggest specific benchmarks for measurable, minimum progress in achieving urgently needed reform as the cooperation between the OSCE and Kazakstan, codified in the recently signed Memorandum of Understanding, develops. The evidence summarized here points alarmingly to the government's blatant bad faith in its work with the OSCE and other bodies engaged in assisting it to enhance compliance with its international human rights commitments. Human Rights Watch is particularly distressed by the adoption of new laws and decrees intended to stifle the legal exercise of electoral rights, the continued intimidation of the print media and the unjustifiable restrictions on broadcast media, and violations of freedom of association, speech and political participation that hinder the development of civil society. Restrictions on Freedom of the Press Kazakstan violates its citizens' right to freely disseminate and receive information through the media in several ways, all of which have in common the hypocritical veil of legality obscuring what amounts to politically-inspired censorship. Direct and indirect censorship have intensified as elections have neared. In early 1997, the government of Kazakstan stripped the independent, privatelyowned broadcast media of their broadcasting rights, with the government directed re-sale of frequencies held by these firms. These sales violated a myriad of Kazakstan's laws, including the terms of the licenses granted to the thirty-seven companies in September, 1996, which provided rights to use those frequencies until April, 1998. In addition, the owners of the frequencies were not informed of the conditions or rules of sale, with the result that although many proffered the selling price named by the government, none were able to retain their channels. Interviews with participants and their counsel revealed that the Kazakstan courts repeatedly refused to consider the substance of the appeals they have lodged. The new owners of these frequencies, several of whom are related to, or have close ties to, President Nazarbayev, have considerably changed the content of the programs aired, replacing news and information with music and entertainment. In September, 1998, the government of Kazakstan began to exert various forms of pressure against an array of privately-owned newspapers with ties to former prime minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin. The most shocking instance concerned the paper XXI Vek, whose editorial offices were extensively damaged by a firebomb on September 26. Interviews with editors of several of these papers reveal striking similarities in all cases. First, printing presses broke contracts and unilaterally refused to continue printing several of the papers. Secondly, the state tax police began investigations against several papers, seizing their property and arresting bank accounts. Thirdly, Kazakstani customs agents began to seize print runs of several of the papers forced to print outside Kazakstan. A court-awarded libel settlement has halted publication of one of the papers (a higher court refused to address the substance of an appeal), while a frivolous suit against another for supposed infractions of the 1991 Law on the Press have temporarily halted its publication. According to several sources, state security personnel in civilian dress continue to harass distributors of one Almaty newspaper, 451 Gradusa po Farengeitu (Farenheit 451). Testimony from journalists confirms that editors of state-owned media outlets impose direct censorship, in particular to enforce the taboo on any criticism of the President or his policies. The politically-motivated dismissal of a popular provincial radio journalist followed on the heels of several of his programs being rejected by the station director, and warnings to alter critical programming. In addition, the government of Kazakstan has seriously encroached on individuals' right to free speech, by subjecting political activist Petr Svoik to criminal charges for allegedly """"inciting ethnic conflict."""" Svoik unequivocally denies the offense; a group of Kazakstan's leading intellectuals have written an open letter in his support. This charge, lodged against Svoik as he served a three-day administrative sentence for participation in an unregistered public association (see below), carries a possible sentence of seven years imprisonment, and has, as intended, thrown a pall over opposition efforts to criticize the conduct of elections. Freedom of Association Violations Though Kazakstan can boast a wealth of non-governmental organizations, evidence gathered from sources in several cities suggests that the government of Kazakstan has begun to limit its citizens' right to form public associations in connection with the upcoming elections. The government of Kazakstan has systematically denied official registration to several groups which formed for the express purpose of participating in election and campaign monitoring. On October 15 the leaders of one stillborn group, Za Chestnye Vybory (For Honest Elections) were fined and given administrative jail sentences for their roles in organizing the movement. In contrast, the Ministry of Justice registered within days an association with a similar mandate, but organized by figures within the government and those from groups which openly support Nazarbayev (""""Public Committee for Monitoring of Presidential Elections in the Republic of Kazakstan""""). Authorities from several municipalities repeatedly denied permission for members of the group Pokolenie (Generation) to hold public demonstrations in September and October. Authorities arrested and fined participants of the group's unsanctioned meetings; participants testified to the use of excessive force and humiliation by the police. Violations of the Right to Participate in Public Affairs Human Rights Watch considers that the calling of presidential elections for January 10, 1999 violates Kazakstani law by altering the results of the 1995 referendum extending the president's term in office and setting elections for October, 2000. According to the Constitution of Kazakstan, only another referendum can overturn provisions adopted by referendum. The October 8 decision of parliament left only a limited time for potential candidates to surmount the considerable barriers to registration (including a fee equaling 1,000 times the minimum monthly wage, and the collection of signatures from 2% of the voting population), which in and of themselves constitute a serious limit on the right to stand for elections. The government of Kazakstan engaged in a concerted effort to control the outcome of the vote, in the first place by eliminating certain potential candidates. Even more disturbingly, the machinery of the state has been deployed in support of the sitting president's candidacy. When viewed in light of the overwhelming concentration of power in the hands of the president (who controls appointments of local governors, judges and members of the Central Electoral Commission), these facts mitigate against any possibility of a truly contested election, and against the government's claims of compliance with its OSCE commitments. In May, 1998, parliament adopted amendments to the Law on Elections which disqualify any person with a standing conviction from the year prior to the vote from running for any public office. Courts cited this law as the grounds for denying former prime minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin, activists Mels Eleusizov and Asylbek Amantai, all of whom were convicted of administrative offenses (Kazhegeldin and Eleusizov for participating in the meeting of """"For Honest Elections,"""" see above), registration as candidates. Kazhegeldin has continued to organize political support among the opposition, for which several of his supporters have been harassed or assaulted. First-hand testimony from employees of state-run enterprises, schools, universities, and hospitals, and from students and traders in public markets, informs that the directors of these institutions participated in gathering signatures in support of President Nazarbayev's candidacy by instructing their subordinates to sign, often using explicit or implicit threats to coerce compliance. Sources also report conversations with public officials confirming explicit instructions from the central government, complete with target figures, on conducting the signature-gathering campaign. According to Kazakstani law, only registered members of a candidate's campaign staff may gather signatures. Though election officials are forbidden from officially supporting one or another candidate, the chairwoman of one local electoral commission announced publicly her intention of campaigning for Nazarbayev. Supporters of Communist Party candidate Serikbolsyn Abdildin relate that party members sitting on local election commissions have been dismissed, and that municipal authorities have denied permission to use local meeting halls. First-hand accounts suggest harassment of Communist Party activists by local police. Recommendations The complex of intimidation, prejudicial laws and administrative practice excludes any possibility of free and fair elections. Recognizing this, the OSCE has called for the postponement of elections so that conditions for a truly participatory process can be met. With the understanding that the government of Kazakstan has no intention of postponing the vote, the OSCE has decided to send only a limited assessment mission. However, the Kazak press has distorted this fact, reporting that the OSCE will send a limited quantity of election observers. Therefore, Human Rights Watch calls on the OSCE to: 1. Send a clear and unambiguous message to the government of Kazakstan of the unacceptability of the practices outlined above, by refusing any participation in or observation of the Kazak presidential vote by delegations of any size or composition whatsoever. 2. Review terms of the Memorandum of Understanding signed with Kazakstan recently, postponing the establishment of the planned OSCE Almaty field office until basic preconditions for free and fair parliamentary elections, scheduled for October, 1999, have been met. Firstly, Kazakstan's legislature should repeal amendments to article 4(4) to the """"Decree of the President of the Republic of Kazakstan, with the force of constitutional law, ‘on elections in the Republic of Kazakstan,'"""" from May 8, 1998, which disqualify persons who have been subject to administrative penalties (fines or prison terms) for violations of the law during the year preceding the elections, and those with convictions resulting in sentences which have not been served by the date of registration, from standing in any national or local elections. Secondly, article 188(2) outlawing participation in any unregistered social organization should be struck from the Kazak administrative code, and the convictions of all those persons charged with this offense should be overturned. Thirdly, the Kazak Ministry of Justice must expeditiously register any independent citizens' organizations formed to monitor the election process, removing the differential barriers to registration for those groups presumed to be in support of the current government, and those presumed to be in opposition. Fourthly, the Main Procuracy should initiate an investigation into reported violations of the Law on Elections, and ensure that election officials found guilty of overt or covert support for any candidate will be removed from electoral commissions. The upcoming elections in Kazakstan, marred as they are by violations of national and international law, can provide an opportunity for the international community to show its unequivocal disdain for the deterioration of civil and political freedoms in that country. Human Rights Watch urges the OSCE to continue its principled stance against Kazakstan's mounting record of anti-democratic steps, and to consider incorporating the above recommendations into its own proposed benchmarks for progress.

In a move that will transform the human rights landscape, the international community of states agreed, by an overwhelming 120 in favor, 21 abstentions and only 7 against, to embrace this essential institution for bringing the world's worst human rights criminals to justice. When it receives the 60 ratifications necessary for its entry into force, an ICC will be created with enormous potential as an instrument of international justice, and as a deterrent against future atrocities.  In the Introduction to Justice in the Balance, Recommendations for an Effective and Independent ICC, the Human Rights Watch commentary to the Rome conference, we identified seven benchmarks that must be met """"if the ICC is to be an independent, fair and effective judicial institution."""" These were: 1) a jurisdictional regime free of any state consent requirement; 2) independence from the Security Council; 3) an ex officio prosecutor; 4) qualified deference to state claims of jurisdiction (complementarity); 5) authority over war crimes whether committed in international or non-international conflicts; 6) clear legal obligation for state parties to comply with court requests for judicial cooperation; and 7) the highest standards of international justice respecting the rights of the accused and appropriate protection for witnesses. Assessing the Conference results with these criteria in mind, we have a very good statute. Even the most serious weakness - the jurisdictional regime that requires, in the absence of a Security Council referral, that either the state of territory or nationality of the accused to be a party or consent - can be minimized by widespread ratification. While it is not perfect, its provisions provide a workable starting point for a court that could make a real and lasting difference.   It is a historic step forward for the protection of human rights and enforcement of international law.   This paper summarizes the key provisions of the statute, addressing firstly the above-mentioned seven benchmarks followed by other important aspects of the treaty, with brief commentary on the debate that gave rise to the most controversial of its provisions.   1. ACCEPTANCE OF JURISDICTION   The provisions on jurisdiction lie at the heart of the ICC treaty. They formed the essential elements of the package deal that was struck during the final days of the Rome conference.   When a state ratifies the treaty it thereby accepts the Court's jurisdiction over all crimes within its scope. There is therefore no possibility of a state party accepting jurisdiction over certain crimes and not others, or being required to consent to the exercise of jurisdiction on a case by case basis. The conference's categoric rejection of earlier proposals to this effect, that would have completely disempowered the Court, was a major relief.   The only exception to automatic jurisdiction for state parties lies in the transitional provision of Article 124. This allows states to opt out of the court's jurisdiction over war crimes committed on its territory or by its nationals for a period of 7 years after the entry into force of the statute vis a vis that particular state. States have to chose to avail themselves of this provision, however, and hopefully few if any will. While such a provision is legally and morally unjustifiable, distinguishing as it does between war crimes and others, the opt out is limited to a non renewable period of 7 years.   The most problematic aspect of the whole treaty is the provision relating to the preconditions for the exercise of jurisdiction (Article 12). According to this, in cases other than Security Council referrals, the ICC will only be able to act where the state on whose territory the crimes were committed or the state of nationality of the accused have ratified the treaty or accept the court's jurisdiction over the crime. The deletion of 2 crucial elements of an earlier proposal (the Korean proposal) that would have allowed a state with custody of the accused or a state of nationality of the victims to provide the necessary jurisdictional link, is the major disappointment of the conference. As the state of territory and nationality of the accused will often in practice be one and the same state, and that state may well not be state party, this is likely to be the greatest impediment to the Court's ability to make a difference in the real world. However defective, the provision is not necessarily fatal to the Court and there are ways to circumvent it. In particular, much will depend on the extent of ratification of the treaty: the closer to universal ratification, the less the potential of this provision to disempower the Court.   2. DEFERRAL UPON SECURITY COUNCIL REQUEST   Security Council ability to suspend or delay ICC prosecutions was adamantly opposed by a strong contingent of states throughout the conference. The role of the Security Council, as well as the exclusion of nuclear weapons, was the subject of the Indian motion to amend the Chair's final package, defeated at the eleventh hour of the conference.   The final text of the statute (Article 16) strikes a compromise between this view and the text of the ILC draft that would have given permanent members veto over which cases went before the Court. It provides that no investigation or prosecution can be commenced or proceeded with for a renewable period of twelve months where the Security Council, acting under Chapter VII, has so decided. Deferral would require a decision of the Council, and therefore excludes the possibility of one state's veto blocking jurisdiction, but it does leave open the possibility of unlimited renewal and perpetual deferral. Before the Rome conference the U.K. was the only permanent member to support this approach, with the other four and Israel supporting permanent member veto power. The opponents gradually revealed their willingness to accept a version of the compromise proposal, the final version of which is in the statute.   Proposals to allow the preservation of evidence in the event of deferral are unfortunately not reflected in the statute.   3. TRIGGERING AN INVESTIGATION   Ex Officio Powers   In a crucial positive outcome, the ICC Prosecutor can investigate allegations of crimes not only upon referral from the Security Council and state parties, but also on information from victims, non governmental organizations or any other reliable source (Article 15). We considered this crucial given probable state and security council reluctance to refer situations to the Court. Moreover, the ex officio provisions are arguably the most important of those that give the victim and survivors a role in the ICC process, by enabling them to trigger investigations.   If the Prosecutor him or herself decides that the case should not proceed, he or she must go back and inform the source of the original information. If the decision is that there is a reasonable basis to proceed with an investigation, this is then subject to pre trial judicial approval. This judicial review mechanism is not, however, an opportunity for state or individual suspects to challenge admissibility. Proposals to this effect that emerged during the conference were rejected. (The possibility of challenge does arise before any investigation is initiated, as noted in the section on admissibility below, but only once the Pre-Trial Chamber has confirmed that there is a reasonable basis to proceed.) Victims, on the other hand, do have a right to make representations to the Pre-Trial Chamber at the stage of this preliminary review, in accordance with the rules of evidence and procedure to be drawn up in the Preparatory Commission.   Referral by State Parties and the Security Council   State parties (but not, in the end, non state parties) and the Security Council may refer situations to the Court in which one or more crimes appear to have been committed. The referral of """"situations"""" was to prevent political entities making accusations against particular individuals, thereby unduly politicizing the process. Rather, it will be for the Court itself to decide which individuals should be investigated and prosecuted and which should not.   Referral by the Security Council will have the unique consequence of binding all member states of the UN, whether or not parties to the statute: the statute itself notes (Article 12(2)) that the preconditions to the exercise of jurisdiction do not apply in the event of Security Council referral. This makes such referral potentially extremely important tool, ex officio powers notwithstanding.   Investigation And Prosecution   Checks on Prosecutorial discretion   The Statute contains several appropriate checks on prosecutorial discretion that belie claims of an all-powerful ICC prosecutor or a Prosecutor who will be unable to forgo politically motivated or unwarranted investigations (article 53). These checks are additional to those that apply specifically in respect of the exercise of ex officio power. Before initiating an investigation, pursuant to any of the three trigger mechanisms named above, the Prosecutor must satisfy herself that there is a reasonable basis for the investigation. After an investigation is completed, the Prosecutor may conclude there is no basis to proceed. Both decisions include, among other factors, consideration of the broader """"interests of justice"""" which gives the Prosecutor some latitude. If, however, the Prosecutor decides not to proceed further, she is required to inform the Pre-Trial Chamber and, depending on the triggering party, either the referring State Party or the Security Council. At the request of the referring State Party or the Security Council, the Pre- Trial Chamber may review the Prosecutor's decision not to proceed and request that she reconsider. If the decision is based solely on the Prosecutor's consideration of the broader """"interests of justice,"""" the Pre-Trial Chamber may, on its own, review it. A decision based on the interests of justice does not in any case become effective until the Pre-Trial Chamber confirms it.   Powers of the Prosecutor   In general terms, the powers of the Prosecutor to conduct an investigation are seriously limited. It was always envisaged that an ICC, lacking as it does an independent enforcement mechanism, would be dependant on cooperation by states to carry out thorough investigations. But at earlier stages it appeared that the Prosecutor would at least have the legal power, subject to practical constraints, to take certain independent investigative measures. These would include going to the site of a crime and talking independently to witnesses, collecting evidence, etc. We argued that this independent power was essential for the independence and authority of the Prosecutor and, given the reality of frequent state complicity in these crimes, an indispensable characteristic.   In the end, independent investigations ‘on site' are only possible where the relevant national authorities are not ‘available' to themselves take the necessary investigative steps (Article 57(3)). Where there are national authorities, they must be relied upon to take the relevant steps. The Prosecutor will be able to be present and assist the state authorities, but only if this is not prohibited by national law (Article 99(1)). In an important provision on which consensus was painfully difficult, the Prosecutor can take certain """"non-compulsory measures,"""" such as interviewing a voluntary witness without the presence of state authorities if it is essential for the request to be executed. He or she can only take these steps, however, after consultations with the state and, in cases where there has been no formal determination of admissibility, the state can impose conditions on the Prosecutor's ability to do so.   In short, the Prosecutor cannot take basic investigative steps, such as interviewing witnesses, for example, without notifying the state. The practical ramifications of these provision give serious cause for concern. They do, however, demonstrate the hollowness of arguments that the powers of the prosecutor will be overreaching or somehow jeopardize state sovereignty.   4. ADMISSIBILITY (""""COMPLEMENTARITY"""")   Consistent with expectations, the ICC will not be a substitute for national systems, but will only be able to act where national systems do not themselves investigate or prosecute, or where they are """"unable"""" or """"unwilling"""" to do so genuinely. There is a statutory definition of what constitutes inability and unwillingness. As part of the prosecutorial obstacle course enshrined in the statute, various opportunities to challenge admissibility on these grounds are set out.   Preliminary Challenge, National Investigations into """"Situations""""   First, the U.S. proposal (formerly Article 11 bis, now Article 18) found its way into the statute in a much-modified form. This provides that when a situation has first been referred to the court, the Prosecutor must notify all states """"that would normally exercise jurisdiction"""" of the intention to proceed with an investigation. (This would take effect after pre-Trial Chamber approval of the reasonable basis to proceed). Any state--whether party or non-party to the treaty--may then inform the Court that it is dealing with the situation domestically and the Prosecutor will defer to that investigation, unless the Pre-Trial Chamber decides to authorize the investigation. The deferral is open to review by the prosecutor after six months or at any time when there has been a significant change in the state's unwillingness or inability genuinely to carry out the investigation. Very significantly, a state which has challenged a Pre-Trial Chamber ruling under this preliminary provision, is still able to challenge the admissibility of a case on the basis of a state's unwillingness or inability when additional significant facts or significant change of circumstances.   In the event of ICC deferral under this article, there is a provision allowing the Chamber to authorize measures by the Prosecutor for the preservation of evidence. (This is unfortunately not the case in the event of a deferral following a decision on the admissibility of a particular """"case,"""" as explained below.)   Challenging the admissibility of Cases   States, again including non parties to the treaty, have another opportunity to block a prosecution by challenging the admissibility of particular cases (Article 17). A case could be challenged not only where the state itself is investigating or prosecuting, or has prosecuted, but also where the state decided not to proceed with a prosecution, unless the decision was due to the inability or unwillingness of the state. (Another ground open to a state of territory or nationality, if a non state party, would be that it had not accepted jurisdiction, as provided for in Article 12). Several parties may challenge the admissibility of a case: an accused person; any state that has jurisdiction over the case because it is investigating or prosecuting the case or has investigated or prosecuted it; or the state of territory or nationality of the accused. In this challenge, the referring state, the Security Council as well as victims may submit observations to the Court. In general, there would be only one opportunity for challenge, which takes place prior to or at the beginning of trial. However, in exceptional circumstances, the Court may allow more than one challenge or permit it later than the start of trial. Decisions on admissibility may then be appealed to the Appeals Chamber. While the investigation is suspended pending the Court's decision, the judges may allow the prosecutor to take steps to preserve evidence and complete the collection of evidence begun prior to the challenge. However, there is no provision allowing the Chamber to authorize measures to preserve evidence following a deferral. If the Court decides the case is inadmissible, the Prosecutor may submit a request for a review when she believes that new facts have arisen negating the basis of a previous ruling of inadmissibility.   Unfortunately, as a result of the omission of earlier draft provisions, it may be difficult for the ICC, once it has deferred to a state, to exercise jurisdiction in the future if the national proceedings turn out not to be genuine. First, draft provisions that obliged states to notify the Court of the steps taken on the national level have been deleted. Not even state parties are expressly obliged to do so under the present statute. This would have equipped the Court with the information to assess whether the deferral continued to be justified.   5. THE CRIMES   The ICC is being set up to deal with the ‘most serious crimes of concern to the international community'. It will have jurisdiction only over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, as defined in the statute. Although in principle aggression also falls within its competence, the Court will not be able to prosecute cases of aggression in the foreseeable future. (Article 5).   GENOCIDE (Article 6)   The definition of genocide is that contained in the 1948 Genocide Convention. This was not the subject of any debate in Rome. No consideration was given to the possibility of extending the definition to cover social and political groups. But similarly, earlier attempts to restrict the definition further than the conventional definition were discarded.   CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY (Article 7)   Emerging from painstaking negotiations, the definition of Crimes Against Humanity (CAH) embodies a delicate compromise and a complex, ambiguous text. While some of the specific ‘acts' that may constitute crimes against humanity are broader than those contained in existing legal instruments, the thresholds determining when those acts do constitute crimes against humanity for ICC purposes are more restrictive.   Thresholds    Crimes against humanity must be committed pursuant to a to a widespread or systematic attack. There was extensive debate in Rome as to whether the attack should instead have to be widespread AND systematic, and as to the definition of 'attack'. While, consistent with established international law, the ‘or' language prevailed, """"attack"""" is defined restrictively. It requires both that there be the """"multiple commission of acts"""", and that they be carried out """"pursuant to a state or organizational policy"""". The double criteria of multiple acts and the existence of a policy, coupled with the requirement that the acts be carried out """"in the knowledge of the attack"""" impose an unprecedented threshold for crimes against humanity.   Despite the early insistence by a coordinated group of Arab League states, supported by China and India, that the ICC should only try crimes against humanity committed in armed conflict, with some seeking to limit it further to international conflict, in the end there is no such armed conflict nexus. Any other approach would have been a major step backwards in international law.   Enumerated Acts   The list of acts that constitute CAH for these purposes includes murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation or forcible transfer, severe arbitrary deprivation of liberty, and torture. More controversially, it also includes the following:   """"Rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy and enforced sterilization or any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity""""   The Holy See, backed by the Arab League nations, mounted a concerted attack against the inclusion of this crime, as well as on persecution based on gender (below). In the end, they were unsuccessful in that both forced pregnancy and the term """"gender"""" were included in the treaty.   """"Persecution...on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law""""   The inclusion of gender persecution in the treaty was achieved in the face of strident opposition. Another controversial inclusion is persecution on """"other grounds"""" beyond those specified in the statute, but the confusing limitation to those """"universally recognized"""" grounds is regrettable. Of real concern is the requirement that persecution must be committed in conjunction with another crime under the statute. This removes the prosecution of persecution per se from the Court's jurisdiction, which is inconsistent with the clearly stated position of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) that persecution is in itself a crime against humanity.   """"Enforced disappearance of persons""""   This crime is included and defined in the statute, negating nervous rumors at the outset of the conference that it would be deleted. A definition is included that is slightly more restrictive than the U.N. and Inter-American Convention definitions, requiring, for example, intent to remove the person from the protection of the law """"for a prolonged period of time.""""   """"Apartheid""""   is included and defined within the statute. The definition is, however, once again more restrictive that than that in the Apartheid Convention, and appears not to cover certain fundamental aspects of apartheid; for example--preventing political, social, economic or cultural participation of a racial group, or dividing the population in the creation of separate reserves and ghettos, prohibition of mixed marriages, etc.   """"other inhumane acts of a similar character intentionally causing great suffering, or serious injury to... body or health.""""   Finally, this important and controversial generic category was included. This gives the Court the flexibility to cover other crimes against humanity that may emerge over time, not contemplated in the statute, which is very positive.   WAR CRIMES (Article 8)   The statute gives the Court jurisdiction over an exhaustive list of war crimes, with separate lists for international and non-international conflicts. The international list contains 34 crimes, the non-international 16. It does not contain a generic formulation giving the Court the possibility of exercising jurisdiction over other crimes that may emerge as crimes under customary law in the future. For the Court to have jurisdiction over crimes beyond those set out in the statute, there would have to be amendment to the statute which, as noted in the amendment section below, would be difficult to achieve and apply only to states that accept the amendment (Article 121).   The vast majority of the crimes included are taken directly from, or clearly derive from, established provisions of international law, principally Hague law or the Geneva Conventions and protocols. The crimes of gender violence, for example, do not appear expressly in these conventions but are part of other non gender specific crimes that do, as developed in the statutes and case law of the Tribunals. In several places the ICC formulations are different from and more restrictive than the established definitions on which they are based. The statute is far from comprehensive, having omitted various provisions of Hague and Geneva law, thus excluding them from the Court's jurisdiction.   A chapeau to the war crimes section provides that the Court will prosecute war crimes """"in particular when committed pursuant to a plan or policy or as part of the large scale commission of such crimes."""" This does not impose another jurisdictional limitation on the Court, but makes clear the objective is to prioritize the most serious crimes that demand international prosecution.   International conflict   One of the most significant departures from existing language can be seen in the crime of launching an attack that causes incidental civilian losses, included for international conflicts, entirely omitted for internal. At the initiative of the U.S., the principle of proportionality inherent in this crime is reformulated so that the ICC only has jurisdiction over attacks with a civilian impact that is """"clearly excessive"""" in relation to the """"overall"""" military advantage. While """"clearly"""" seeks to exclude borderline cases, overall military advantage seeks to ensure that such military advantage would not be measured by the consequences of the single attack, but in the context of the broader military operation.   The """"transfer, directly or indirectly, by an occupying power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies"""" is included for international conflicts. While the language of """"directly or indirectly"""" is new, the crime of transfer by an occupying power of parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies is taken directly from the 4th Geneva Convention and the grave breaches provisions of Protocol I (Art. 85(4)(1)).   One of the most difficult provisions to resolve was that on prohibited weapons. In the course of the conference, when certain states in favor of the inclusion of nuclear weapons realized that there was no prospect of success on this, they unfortunately insisted that chemical and bacteriological weapons also be removed. The resulting list of prohibited weapons is very short - poison or poisoned weapons, asphyxiating or poison gases or liquids, and dum-dum bullets - with no effective catch-all clause for other weapons causing unnecessary suffering. Although there is a provision that specifically contemplates the possibility additions to the list of weapons in the future, the only prospect for expansion of the list is by the difficult amendment process.   At least as controversial was the inclusion of crimes of sexual and gender violence. Focused on the historical failure to address these crimes, the women's caucus successfully campaigned to have """"rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization and any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity"""" explicitly included as a separate category of war crimes, notwithstanding ferocious lobbying by those opposed to its inclusion. As a result, no longer will these crimes have to be defined only as crimes against honor or as part of some other category.   Another crime which is included for both types of conflict, which the HRW Children's Rights Division strongly pursued, is conscripting or enlisting children under 15 or using them to participate actively in hostilities. In another example of reformulating Geneva language, """"recruiting"""" was replaced with """"conscripting or enlisting"""", principally at U.S. insistence. In the international conflict context the crime is unfortunately limited to conscription or enlistment into """"national"""" armed forces. Human Rights Watch had pressed for alternative language, using 18 as the relevant age for ICC purposes. On this point many key states expressed unwillingness to move beyond the framework of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions which establishes 15 as the relevant age, although they were willing to depart from the wording of the Protocol on the formulation of this and other crimes. In the end there was broad support for these provisions as reformulated.   Non-International Conflict   The Court's ability to prosecute crimes committed in the context of internal armed conflict was as contentious as it promised to be. As noted above, the list of crimes committed in internal conflict over which the Court has jurisdiction is unsurprisingly more restrictive than those committed in international section. As such, the Court will be able to prosecute crimes such as attacks causing incidental civilians losses, the starvation of civilians, or the use of prohibited weapons, for example, only when committed in international but not in non-international armed conflict. However unacceptable this differential is, the final resolution is better than it threatened to be even in the final days of the conference, and allows for the prosecution of very serious war crimes, whatever the context on which they are committed.   The statute list covers all of Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions and aspects of Protocol II. The list does not, however, include all prohibitions contained in Protocol II, omitting collective punishments, terrorism, slavery; attacks against installations containing dangerous forces.   Some sought to restrict the scope of the Court's jurisdiction beyond the exhaustive list, by imposing a qualifying chapeau to the internal conflict section. A provision was introduced (Article 8(2)(f)) that limits the Court's jurisdiction to situations where there is """"protracted"""" noninternational armed conflict, a requirement that is not contained in Protocol II. Another qualifier provides that nothing in the statute shall affect the responsibility of a government to maintain or reestablish law and order in the state or to defend the unity and territorial integrity of the state by all legitimate means. While this provision gave considerable comfort to states otherwise opposed to the inclusion of internal conflicts, its impact is as yet unclear.   AGGRESSION (Article 5(2))   As a result of a last minute addition, the statute provides that the court also has jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. However, this inclusion, which was a critical element in bringing a number of states on board, is more presentational than real. The Court can only exercise jurisdiction over aggression once the statute is amended to include a definition of the crime and the circumstances in which it can be prosecuted. As any crime can be added to the statute by such amendment, this provision has little affect other than as an expression of intent to include aggression in the future. The reference to any future provision being consistent with the UN Charter was intended to indicate that the Security Council would have to have made a prior determination that an act of aggression had occurred before the ICC could prosecute this crime.   Elements of Offences   One of the many ways in which the statute sought to defer to United States interests is the provision on detailed """"elements of offences"""" (Article 9). However, it provides only that elements shall be adopted by the Assembly of State parties, and that they shall provide guidance to the Court. They shall neither delay the entry into force nor bind the Court. When the Preparatory Commission meets one of the items on its agenda will be drawing up the elements of the crimes.   Savings Clause   Given that the statute excludes several important crimes from its scope, imposes definitions at times more restrictive than those in existing international law, and that it allows for the opt out for war crimes (see below), the savings clause is very important (Article 11). It clarifies that nothing in the treaty shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law.   6. COOPERATION   As noted above, in the absence of an independent police force, state cooperation is essential at all stages and the Cooperation section of the statute is critical to an understanding of how the Court will function in practice. Although the opening article refers to the general duty to """"cooperate fully"""" with the Court, other provisions do make clear that there is in fact a legal obligation on State parties to comply with requests from the court. Non state parties are not, of course, under any obligation toward the Court.   Despite many proposals to the contrary, there are no exceptions to the duty to transfer suspects to the Court which is a very positive development. The weakness in the cooperation framework lies, however, in two major exceptions to the duty of state parties to provide """"other forms of cooperation"""". First, as a result of U.S. and French insistence, the Court cannot order disclosure of information or prevent an individual from giving evidence if, in the state's view, it would prejudice its national security interests. This proposal prevailed over one from the U.K., which would ultimately have allowed the court to make the determination as to the validity of any claim to national security and to order a state to disclose information if it was found to be acting in bad faith and the claim was manifestly unfounded. Under the present text (Article 71), the court can however find a state to be in breach of its obligation to cooperate in good faith and refer the matter to the Assembly of State parties.   The second exception is where compliance with a request is prohibited on the basis of an existing fundamental legal principle of national law (Article 93(3)). In such case, the statute provides that, after consultation with the state, the Court must amend the request. A preferable approach, and one more solidly based on legal principle, would have been to oblige the state to amend its law, not the ICC to amend its request. These provision reflect the enormous deference to arguments of 'state sovereignty' apparent throughout the statute.   7. RIGHTS OF SUSPECTS/ACCUSED AND VICTIM PROTECTION   The rights of suspects (Article 55) and accused persons (Article 67) are protected to the highest standard in the treaty. It contains all of the guarantees enshrined in international instruments and in certain respects goes beyond. The statute seeks to maintain a balance adequate protection for victims without infringing upon the rights of the accused and is, on its face, quite successful in this respect. The provisions on evidence (Articles 68(2) and 69), which allow for exceptional measures such as in-camera hearings and recorded testimony so far as they do not impinge upon the rights of the accused, are examples. Such special measures shall be taken by the Court where the victim is a child or victim of sexual violence, unless the Court decides otherwise.   In addition to provisions relating specifically to the rights of the accused, the statute obliges the prosecutor to investigate not only incriminating but also exonerating evidence, as well as to make such evidence available to the defense. Moreover, the Pre-Trial Chamber has an important role protecting the rights of the accused and checking the Prosecutor's authority. First, in those situations where there is a unique opportunity to take testimony or collect evidence which might not be available subsequently at trial, the prosecutor must inform the Pre-Trial Chamber (article 56). If, on the Prosecutor's request, the judges believe that measures are necessary to protect the rights of the accused, it may, among other steps, appoint an expert or a judge to supervise the proceeding. If the Pre-Trial Chamber believes the Prosecutor's failure to request such measures is unjustified, the Chamber take measures on its own.   The Pre-Trial Chamber must hold a hearing before trial and confirm the charges against an accused, on the basis that there is sufficient evidence to establish substantial grounds that the accused committed the crime (article 61). The accused has the right to attend and be represented.   Trials in Presence of the Accused   Despite troublesome working group discussions, the final version does not allow for trials in absentia (Article 63). The statute permits trials to proceed without the presence of the accused only if he or she is disruptive, in which case measures must be taken to allow them to """"observe the trial and instruct counsel from outside the courtroom."""" The statute does however allow for the confirmation of charges in the absence of the suspect, and requires the presence of legal counsel for the suspect when """"the Pre-Trial Chamber determines it is in the interests of justice.""""   Note on Victims   To a large extent the ICC statute succeeds in making appropriate provision for victims of the crimes that the ICC is established to address. In a major step forward for victims of atrocities, the court has broad powers to order convicted persons to make reparations to victims (Article 73). Those reparations can take financial or symbolic form. Individual victims are entitled to participate directly in these aspects of the court's proceedings. Earlier French proposals that the ICC should be able to make orders against states to pay were dropped in Rome. However, the possibility of vicarious state liability where the individuals in question were state actors remains open.   The provision on the ex officio powers of the Prosecutor (Article 15) expressly recognizes the legitimate potential role for victims as initiators of ICC investigation. In addition, an article specifically directed at """"the protection of victims and witnesses"""" deals not only with the Court's duty to take appropriate protective measures, and the establishment of the Victim and Witness Unit, but also the right of victims to present their views at various stages of the criminal proceedings where their personal interests are directly affected.   (Other Important Sections)   8. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LAW   Several small victories in this section include no statute of limitations, the principle of legality and the fact that the Court has jurisdiction only over crimes committed after its entry into force.   Minimum Age for ICC Jurisdiction   In a major breakthrough, early agreement was achieved that the Court would only have jurisdiction over persons of 18 years of age or older (Article 26). Many states had previously supported setting an age of criminal responsibility below eighteen, or allowing the court discretion to try minors based on subjective criteria such as the defendant's maturity. Presenting this issue not as one of the age of criminal responsibility but as a jurisdictional limitation made it possible to cut through the earlier stalemate, with the statute finally providing that """"[t]he court shall have no jurisdiction over any person who was under the age of 18 at the time of the alleged commission of a crime.""""   Command Responsibility   The provisions on the responsibility of commanders, along with superior orders, created the most controversy in this part of the statute.   On command responsibility, the statute distinguishes between military and other commanders. For the former, it sets out the Nuremberg test: he or she must have known, or owing to the circumstances should have known and failed to take reasonable measures to prevent the crimes or to submit them for investigation afterwards. For civilian superiors however, the standard is higher and the approach apparently unprecedented. The superior has to have effective authority and control over the persons and activities constituting the crimes, and must have known or consciously disregarded information that clearly indicated that subordinates were committing or were about to commit crimes, and failed in the manner referred to above.   Defenses, Superior Orders   Regarding superior orders as a defense, the ICC treaty takes a step back from the Nuremberg Charter and the statutes of the ad hoc Tribunals, which contained an absolute prohibition on superior orders as a defense. While the statute is controversial in not ruling out the application of the defense, it does greatly restrict its scope. It only applies where the following criteria are met: there was a legal obligation to obey the orders; the person did not know the order was unlawful and the order was not manifestly unlawful. It expressly cannot apply in cases of genocide and crimes against humanity, which the statute deems inherently manifestly unlawfully.   Other Defenses   In general, after protracted negotiations, the treaty allows for quite a broad range of defenses, each set out in some detail in the statute. Some of these we supported, such as extreme duress, others are broader than we would have liked, such as intoxication. Given the serious nature of the crimes in question, it is troubling that defense of property (as well as self-defense or defense of others) may in certain circumstances constitute a defense to the commission of war crimes, although not genocide or crimes against humanity.   Non Bis In Idem   The important protection against double jeopardy is contained in the statute.   Applicable Law   Article 33 provides that the law to be applied by the court will be firstly, the statute, elements of crimes and the rules of evidence and procedure, secondly, international law and thirdly, general principles derived from national systems so far as consistent with international human rights. In an important and in the event contentious provision, the statute and other sources must be applied and interpreted consistently with internationally recognized human rights and be """"without any distinction as to gender, age, race...or other status.""""   Note on Legal Persons   A proposal was put forward that would have allowed the Court to have jurisdiction over legal as well natural persons but was eventually rejected, largely at U.S. insistence. Therefore the ICC will not have jurisdiction to declare organizations criminal. This is out of line with the Nuremberg precedent.  9. COMPOSITIONS AND ADMINISTRATION   Judicial candidates will be expert in either criminal or international law. They shall be nominated by state parties (though they need not be nationals of state parties) and elected by the Assembly of state parties. States that do not become parties will therefore be left outside the selection process.   As part of the general onslaught against gender references throughout the draft statute, the phrase that """"State Parties shall, in the selection of judges, take into account gender balance"""" came under attack. Even more disturbing was the strong resistance to the inclusion of judges with expertise in sexual and gender violence. Many claimed that this was giving """"special preference"""" to this issue. A compromise was reached in which state parties shall take into account the need for a """"fair representation of female and male judges"""" and the need to include judges with """"legal expertise on specific issues, including but not limited to, violence against women and children.""""   A Victim and Witness Unit is established (Article 43) with responsibility for """"protective measures, security arrangements, counseling and other appropriate assistance for witnesses, victims who appear before the Court and others who are at risk on account of testimony given by such witnesses."""" In line with our recommendation, the Unit is located within the registry, independent of the Prosecutor's office.   The statute contains provision for the removal from office or other disciplinary measure against any judge or Prosecutor guilty of misconduct (Articles 46 and 47).   The working languages of the Court shall be Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish (Article 50). Its Rules of Evidence and Procedure shall be adopted by the Assembly of state parties (Article 51), after having been drawn up by the Preparatory Commission. Non state parties are therefore not entitled to be involved in the adoption of the Rules as such, though they may be involved in their creation through the preparatory commission. The Regulations, governing the day to day running of the Court, are to be drawn up by the judges themselves.  10. PENALTIES   This statute permits the Court to impose two types of penalties: imprisonment for a specified term or life imprisonment (Article 77). After debate over whether there should be minimum and maximum limits set on the terms of imprisonment, in the end, the article only contains a 30 year maximum. Life imprisonment was opposed by a number of countries, particularly Latin American, whose constitutions prohibit this penalty as a violation of human rights, being cruel, inhumane, and inconsistent with rehabilitation. A provision for a mandatory review of penalties, when the person has """"served two thirds of the sentence or 25 years in the case of life imprisonment"""" (Article 110) was added to mitigate some of the concerns about life imprisonment. The Court may also order fines and forfeitures. The Statute recognizes that these penalties would be in addition to imprisonment.   There were divergent and strong views on whether the death penalty should be explicitly included as a penalty, with Trinidad and Tobago, the Arab states, Nigeria, and Rwanda in favor of its inclusion. Not only did these states feel that the core crimes should be punished by the maximum penalty, but they feared that the prohibition of the death penalty in the Statute would impact on their domestic laws. The United States, supported by Japan, made an intervention that the principle of complementarity would permit countries to still use capital punishment to punish the core crimes.   The death penalty is not therefore permitted. An article entitled """"Non prejudice to national application of penalties and national law,""""(Article 80), was offered as a compromise to those states who were pushing for the inclusion of the death penalty; it reads that """"nothing in this part of the statute affects the application by States of penalties prescribed by their national law.""""   11. FINANCING   The Court will be financed from 3 sources: assessed contributions by state parties, contributions by the U.N., as approved by the General Assembly, and voluntary contributions. The relative proportion of UN to state party financing is not resolved in the statute itself.   12. FINAL CLAUSES   Reservations   One very positive aspect of the ICC treaty is the explicit prohibition on reservations (Article 120). The specter of possible reservations, thereby allowing state to opt out of carefully negotiated provisions, continued to loom large until the last day of the Rome conference.   Amendments (Article 121 and 122)   Amendments may be made seven years after the entry into force of the treaty. While the treaty states that they shall be adopted by consensus, failing which by two thirds majority of States Parties, it also provides that for amendments other than those of a purely institutional nature, seven eighths of the state parties have to accept the amendment before it can enter into force. Such a high requirement will ensure that the treaty will not be easily amended.   With regard to amendments to crimes under the Court's jurisdiction (Article 5), the situation is more restrictive still, with the amendment applying only to those state parties that have accepted it. The Court can exercise jurisdiction over a crime only if the state of the territory or nationality of the accused has accepted the particular amendment. This amounts to an opt in for additional crimes.   Ratifications   The statute will enter into force when 60 states ratify (Article 126).","Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

The 150-page report, Behind Bars in Brazil, says that severe overcrowding and institutionalized violence are chronic and widespread in Brazilian prisons and police stations. In the decade since Human Rights Watch first examined prison conditions in Brazil, the inmate population has increased at a rapid pace. Beside exacerbating prison overcrowding-a problem that Human Rights Watch originally documented during its 1988 mission to the country-the fast growth of the inmate population has coincided with years of flagrant prison abuses. Thus, our first Brazil prisons report was succeeded by a 1989 newsletter that focused on conditions in a notorious São Paulo jail, followed by a 1992 report on a massive prison massacre in São Paulo. Our annual summary of global human rights conditions, moreover, has consistently condemned Brazil for severe prison overcrowding, horrendous conditions of detention, and summary executions of inmates. Human Rights Watch's sustained attention to conditions of confinement in Brazil reflects our sense that the mistreatment of prisoners is one of the country's most serious and chronic human rights violations.","Americas, Brazil",""

Major military operations have been underway in the area since early November after armed guerrillas executed three suspected intelligence agents on October 31 and fatally wounded a fourth. Villagers, apparently with some guerrilla support, then attacked a subdistrict military command post on November 9, killing three soldiers and taking thirteen others into custody.  Two men, both East Timorese, remain in captivity; the others were released. Reports of dozens of deaths of civilians in the Manufahi area remain unconfirmed, although abuses have clearly taken place. A local village headman and his son from the village that launched the attack on the military post were killed by the army under circumstances which remain unclear.  Witnesses report that the Alas area is virtually under siege, with people being dragged from their homes in the middle of the night as the army hunts for those responsible for the two attacks. Indonesian authorities have acknowledged arresting at least nine people, including the man regarded as the mastermind of the October executions, but many more are reported to have been taken into custody for interrogation.  Local human rights organizations said they had been denied access to the area. Troop reinforcements were reportedly being sent to the area, and soldiers were reported to be severely restricting freedom of movement of residents. Over 100 people had sought refuge from the military operations in churches and other sites. """"Summary executions by guerrillas clearly violate international humanitarian law, the so-called 'laws of war',"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Soldiers captured by the other side in an armed conflict have human rights like anyone else.""""  Jones said, however, that there is now real concern for civilians in the Alas area. """"Whenever counterinsurgency operations have been mounted in response to attacks in which soldiers have died, it's the civilians who get hurt,"""" she said. """"The military has used torture and arbitrary arrest before to pry information out of a terrified population, and it appears to be doing so again."""" Human Rights Watch called on the army to allow local human rights investigators into the area to examine possible human rights violations by all sides. Investigators need to determine the circumstances under which the deaths took place, including whether soldiers shot at unarmed civilians or whether they returned fire in the context of an armed engagement. The trouble in Manufahi district began on October 31 in the transmigration site of Weberek, about thirty kilometers from Alas village. A group of students were reportedly holding a meeting there to discuss the need for a referendum to show support for East Timor's independence. Some members of the guerrilla organization, Falintil, were reportedly present, as were four men whom the students did not recognize. The four were immediately suspected of being intelligence agents and, indeed, three of them turned out to be soldiers. They were surrounded, tied up, and taken away by the Falintil members, according to local sources. Three, Sgt. Abdul Latief, Sgt. Zainuddin, and a civilian, Ir. Muhammad Slamet Imam Prabowo SE, were found stabbed to death near the Weberek river. A fourth, Private Siswanto, managed to escape and made his way back to the subdistrict military command in Alas; he later died of multiple stab wounds. Following the Weberek incident, the military reportedly began a massive hunt for the killers, and many civilians fled their homes, worried about reprisals. Some of the transmigrants from Java and Bali who lived in Weberek asked to be sent back to their place of origin, as they felt themselves to be in danger from both sides. Some local East Timorese transmigrants who had moved to Weberek from other parts of the territory also asked to be sent home. There are unconfirmed reports that the army used masked men, known as ninjas, to terrorize the local population, a tactic commonly used in East Timor in the early and mid-1990s. On November 9, an armed group of some fifty to eighty men, reportedly including some Falintil guerrillas but mostly villagers from around the village of Taitudak, mounted an attack on the subdistrict military command in Alas, apparently to get Private Siswanto, the man who had escaped from Weberek.  The attackers shot and killed three soldiers (Privates Calistro Hornay and E. Bodi da Costa, both East Timorese, and Sgt. Petrus Bere, origin unclear) and escaped with virtually the entire stock of firearms of the command, over thirty rifles. They also took thirteen soldiers hostage, all but two of whom were released the next day. The two, who remain in guerrilla custody, are also East Timorese, Joao Baptista and Manuel do Santos. Indonesian newspapers reported that the International Committee of the Red Cross is trying to negotiate their release.  Military operations in the Alas area intensified after the November 9 attack, and at least two people were killed by the military last week: Vicente, the village head of Taitudak, and his son. The army maintains they were killed in a shoot-out, but there have been no independent reports.

In a letter sent to Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema, Human Rights Watch called upon Italy to prosecute Ocalan for abuses he committed during the 14-year conflict between the PKK and the Turkish government. If Italy does not prosecute, it should extradite Ocalan to another country that will undertake the prosecution in accordance with international law, the letter said. The letter also praised yesterday's decision by the Italian government not to extradite Ocalan to Turkey to stand trial, where Human Rights Watch noted a substantial risk he would face torture and possibly the death penalty. Ocalan was arrested by Italian police last Friday, November 13. The Turkish government requested his extradition to Turkey to stand trial. Turkey's request was denied yesterday, and Ocalan was released from detention on the condition that he remain in Rome. Meanwhile, the Italian authorities are considering Ocalan's request for political asylum. In its letter, Human Rights Watch recounted that between 1992 and 1995, the height of the conflict, Ocalan's PKK is believed to have been responsible for at least 768 extrajudicial executions, mostly of civil servants and teachers, political opponents, off-duty police officers and soldiers, and those deemed by the PKK to be """"state supporters.""""

Human Rights Watch believes that Ocalan should not receive asylum under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and that he must be held accountable for atrocities committed under his leadership in the conflict in Turkey. At the same time, we recognize that extradition of Ocalan to Turkey for trial would violate Italy's international commitments and we think that yesterday's decision to deny Turkey's extradition request was appropriate. Now we believe your government must take the next step to investigate and prosecute Ocalan in Italy, or extradite him to a country, other than Turkey, that is willing to exercise jurisdiction and can assure Ocalan a free and fair trial consistent with international law.   As you may know, Human Rights Watch is a privately funded non-governmental organization dedicated to investigating human rights abuse around the world and advocating policies to counter them. We have conducted extensive research in Turkey, documenting the widespread use of torture in pre-trial detention, as well as gross violations of international humanitarian law committed by both sides to the conflict in the southeast of Turkey, the PKK and state security forces.   Human Rights Watch strongly believes that, in light of the widespread and systematic atrocities against the civilian population committed by the PKK as a matter of policy under Ocalan's leadership, the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees dictates that his asylum claim be denied. That convention precludes asylum for any person """"with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed...a crime against humanity.""""   Moreover, we believe that Ocalan must be brought to justice for his offenses. No promise to renounce terrorism can excuse these abuses nor replace accountability. Nonetheless, we believe that Italy has correctly determined not to send Ocalan to Turkey to stand trial. Given the widespread use of torture in Turkey, extradition of Ocalan to Turkey would conflict with Italy's commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights and the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which prohibit the extradition of an individual to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be subject to torture. Human Rights Watch also approves of Italy's refusal to extradite Ocalan to Turkey on the basis of its maintenance of the death penalty. Since Ocalan cannot be extradited to Turkey to stand trial, we believe it is incumbent upon the government of Italy to take steps to investigate and prosecute him in Italy or extradite him to another country that will both respect the prohibitions against his return to Turkey and hold him accountable in a free and fair trial conducted according to international standards.   The abuses for which Ocalan should be investigated have been documented by Human Rights Watch and other organizations, including the widely respected Human Rights Foundation of Turkey. To summarize, between 1992 and 1995, the height of the conflict in southeastern Turkey, the PKK is believed to have committed at least 768 extrajudicial executions. Targets included teachers, civil servants, political opponents, off-duty police officers and soldiers, and those deemed by the PKK to be """"state supporters."""" In addition, in those same years, the PKK committed numerous large-scale massacres of civilians, usually villagers or villages that somehow were connected with the state civil defense """"village guard system."""" For your reference, we have attached an appendix listing the most notorious massacres that occurred during this period and were attributed to the PKK or for which the PKK took responsibility. In these assaults, 360 people were killed, including thirty-nine women and seventy-six children.   These actions were not committed by rogue units or commanders, but were PKK official policy. At its March 1994 Third National Conference, the PKK made the following declaration:   The struggle which the PKK carries out has left the stage of strategic defense. . . . It is inevitable that we escalate our struggle in response to Turkey's declaration of all-out war.   Consequently, all economic, political, military, social and cultural organizations, institutions, formations -- and those who serve in them -- have become targets. The entire country has become a battlefield.   The PKK also promised to """"liquidate"""" or """"eliminate"""" political parties, """"imperialist"""" cultural and educational institutions, legislative and representative bodies, and """"all local collaborators and agents working for the Republic of Turkey in Kurdistan.""""   As Human Rights Watch has often reported and condemned, Turkish government forces have, in the course of the conflict with the PKK, also committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including torture, extrajudicial killings, and indiscriminate fire. We continue to demand that the Turkish government investigate and hold accountable those members of its security forces responsible for these violations. Nonetheless, under international law, the government abuses cannot under any circumstances be seen to justify or excuse those committed by Ocalan's PKK.   Human Rights Watch has welcomed the leadership role that Italy has played in bringing the world closer to realization of a permanent International Criminal Court. We urge you to exhibit that same commitment to international justice in resolving the Ocalan case.

Short of conclusive evidence that a chemical agent was used, Human Rights Watch called today for a broader international investigation of the allegations in order to bring justice to the victims, strengthen international controls over the proliferation of chemical weapons, and prevent a dangerous arms race in the former Yugoslavia. While the 54-page report, Chemical Warfare in Bosnia? The Strange Experiences of the Srebrenica Survivors, does not present conclusive proof substantiating the allegations, Human Rights Watch has documented the following: In the summer of 1995, shortly after the fall of the United Nations-designated """"safe area"""" of Srebrenica, survivors emerged from a long trek to safety with accounts that they had been attacked during their flight with some type of chemical weapon, possibly an incapacitating agent called BZ. (This agent was originally developed by the United States in the 1960s but was never used). Their column had been attacked by Bosnian Serb forces commanded by Gen. Ratko Mladi. Survivors gave consistent descriptions to Human Rights Watch of mortar shells that produced a """"strange smoke"""" of various colors which did not rise but spread out slowly. Following these attacks, some of the marchers—the numbers are unclear—began to hallucinate and behave in an irrational manner, with some even killing their friends or themselves. So far the behavior following these attacks has defied explanation, including by experts on war-related stress. The army of the former Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA), is known to have possessed incapacitating agents, including BZ, and to have developed doctrine and delivery systems for BZ. The situation that confronted the people fleeing Srebrenica matched the scenario for which the use of incapacitating chemical agents was prescribed in a JNA military manual. The United States government apparently took the allegations seriously enough to conduct an investigation, reported to have taken place in late 1996 or early 1997. The results of this investigation have not been made public, but in late 1996 or early 1997 the U.S. intelligence community was reported to have information suggesting that chemical weapons may have been used in Srebrenica. The U.S. government's refusal to release the findings may, according to a U.S. official interviewed by Human Rights Watch, be based on a belief that making this information public might hurt the international effort to effect peace in the former Yugoslavia. Following interviews with some thirty-five survivors as well as U.N. and other international personnel in the former Yugoslavia, and a review of documentation available in 1996-97 relating to events at Srebrenica, Human Rights Watch has found the evidence, while suggestive of the use of BZ or a similar chemical incapacitant, still incomplete. Most of those reported to have been affected by the """"strange smoke"""" apparently never reached Tuzla and could therefore not be interviewed; they are presumed dead. Physical evidence, including chemical traces in shells or the clothes of people who died during the march and whose bodies were exhumed subsequently, has remained elusive. In a March 1997 report, Clouds of War: Chemical Weapons in the Former Yugoslavia, Human Rights Watch disclosed that it had uncovered evidence that the JNA had an extensive and sophisticated chemical weapons program prior to the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 that included nerve and mustard gasses, but also incapacitating agents like BZ; that the army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) inherited much of this program; and that the army of Bosnia and Hercegovina produced crude chemical munitions during the Bosnian war (1992-95).  Human Rights Watch also revealed that it had strong indications that the army of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was continuing to maintain an offensive chemical weapons capability throughout the 1990s. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is the only state in Europe not to have signed the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention. As sponsor of the Dayton Accords, the international community has a vital stake in the accords' success. Silence on the question whether Serb forces used chemical weapons will give the perpetrators a sense of impunity, and may therefore encourage them to resort to chemical weapons again in any future fighting. Moreover, Yugoslavia's failure to sign the Chemical Weapons Convention may undermine treaty compliance by other Balkan states. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to investigate allegations that chemical weapons were used in Srebrenica. The U.N. Security Council should instruct U.N. agencies, such as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, and the Office of the United Nations Secretary-General, to do so. It should also call for the release of all information on the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons in the former Yugoslavia which international alliances and their member states, including troop contributors of the now-defunct United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), as well as the Stabilisation Force (SFOR) and the International Police Task Force (both currently operating in Bosnia), may have in their possession.","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","Arms"

Augusto Pinochet. As we did in our letter of October 19, Human Rights Watch again wishes to commend the United Kingdom for allowing the arrest of General Pinochet on the Spanish warrant. We have followed the House of Lords proceedings carefully, submitting legal briefs to the Law Lords and attending each court session. Should the Lords reverse the High Court decision that invalidated the arrest, we respectfully urge you to take the principled actions necessary to ensure that General Pinochet is extradited to Spain.   We understand that the Extradition Act grants you discretion to decline extradition, for example where extradition would, having regard to all the circumstances, be """"unjust or oppressive."""" The reasonable exercise of your discretion requires that you take into account the gravity of General Pinochet's offenses, the impunity which General Pinochet would continue to enjoy on returning to Chile, and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law.   The systematic human rights violations committed under General Pinochet's command amount to crimes against humanity. Official Chilean investigations have confirmed that more than 3,100 people were victims of extrajudicial execution or """"disappearance."""" Thousands of others were victims of torture, arbitrary detention, forced exile, or other abuses. Indeed, torture of political detainees in clandestine detention centers was systematic throughout the Pinochet regime, often overseen by doctors expert in keeping victims barely alive.   International law - as well as the prevention of future atrocities - demands the prosecution of those responsible for such crimes.   In April 1978, however, the Chilean military granted itself a general amnesty from prosecution and punishment for its crimes. The self-amnesty covers the period when most of the worst abuses took place, from the coup in September 1973 to March 1978. The Chilean Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the measure's constitutionality. The Chilean government has touted one recent Supreme Court decision that one investigation of alleged """"war crimes"""" committed by the military before 1978 could proceed. But in the Chilean legal system, this single case does not establish any precedent for subsequent legal action. Indeed, in a later case, the Supreme Court again upheld the amnesty above international human rights law.   Similarly, General Pinochet will not be indicted, prosecuted or punished in Chile for human rights crimes committed after the period covered by the self-amnesty. As """"senator-for-life,"""" a bargain for leaving office in 1990, Pinochet is protected from such prosecutions. Theoretically, the Chilean Supreme Court could strip him of this immunity, if it found him guilty of criminal acts. But since the military left office in 1990, the court has never deprived a member of congress of immunity. In any case, any indictment of General Pinochet in Chile would surely lead military tribunals to claim jurisdiction over the matter, another guarantee that he will never face justice. In past civilian-military conflicts over jurisdiction, Chile's Supreme Court has readily acceded to such demands from the military. Military courts are staffed by current and former military officers whom Pinochet either promoted or appointed.   Britain is also under an international obligation to try or extradite persons accused of the horrible crimes at issue here. This obligation is set forth, inter alia, in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to which the United Kingdom is a party. Torture is one of the charges on which General Pinochet's extradition is sought. As a party to the European Convention on Human Rights, the United Kingdom also has an obligation to ensure access to justice for the victims of General Pinochet's crimes. Several European countries have sent the unequivocal message that they believe General Pinochet should stand trial. Spain, France and Switzerland have all requested his extradition. Returning the general to Chile would deprive his victims in these countries of their right to a remedy.   General Pinochet's lawyers argued in the House of Lords that Britain should defer to the """"arrangement"""" reached in Chile which included the military's self-amnesty. We strongly believe, however, that the international community has a greater long-term interest in making it clear to those who would use violence to seize power that they face punishment if they embark on crimes against humanity. There is little chance of preventing such terrible crimes if their authors know that at the end of the day they can bargain for an amnesty and escape punishment.   Given the gravity of General Pinochet's offenses, the impunity he enjoys in Chile and the United Kingdom's obligations under international law, we respectfully submit that there are no circumstances by which the extradition of Pinochet to Spain could reasonably be considered either """"unjust or oppressive.""""

They began trying to march to the parliament building to demand the session be closed down; they also demanded the resignation of President Habibie and an end to the role of the armed forces in politics. By Friday, the student ranks had been swelled with large numbers of youths and others, angry at the army barricades that prevented them from moving about the city. Jones called on APEC leaders to make personal appeals now, and to reiterate the need for an investigation when they meet with President Habibie at the APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur next month.

In arguments before a five-member panel of the House of Lords, which is ruling on whether Pinochet has immunity from extradition, Pinochet's lawyer Clare Montgomery stated on Tuesday that """"a forum is available to deal with the matter [in Chile].""""  """"There is no chance that Pinochet will be prosecuted by a Chilean court,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"This is a cynical ploy to get Pinochet back home where he can be shielded from justice."""" At least eleven cases now in Chilean courts raise the issue of Pinochet's culpability for human rights violations. But as a senator-for-life, a position he claimed as part of his bargain for leaving office in 1990, Pinochet is protected from such prosecutions. Theoretically, the Chilean Supreme Court could strip him of his immunity, if it found him guilty of criminal acts. But since the military left office in 1990, the court has never deprived a member of congress of immunity.  If, by some miracle, Pinochet suddenly were indicted for his crimes, a military tribunal would surely claim jurisdiction in the case, arguing that Pinochet's crimes were committed as part of his military service. In past conflicts over jurisdiction, Chile's Supreme Court has readily acceded to such demands from the military. Military courts are staffed by current and former military officers whom Pinochet either promoted or appointed.  In April 1978, the Chilean military granted itself a general amnesty from prosecution and punishment for its crimes, and in 1990, the Supreme Court upheld the measure's constitutionality. The amnesty covers the period when most of the worst abuses took place, from the coup in September 1973 to March 1978. The official Chilean truth commission has said that more than 3,100 people were executed or """"disappeared"""" during the years of military dictatorship, 1973-1990. The Chilean government has touted a recent Supreme Court decision that the Geneva Conventions could prevail over the self-amnesty in one investigation of alleged war crimes committed by the military before 1978. But in the Chilean legal system, this single case does not establish any precedent for subsequent legal action. Indeed, in a later case, the Supreme Court again upheld the amnesty above international human rights law. Out of several hundred military officers who might be implicated in cases of serious human rights abuse, only three have been prosecuted. The 1978 amnesty expressly excluded the car-bombing murder of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and U.S. citizen Ronni Karpen Moffitt in Washington, D.C. in 1976. A U.S. grand jury indicted four members of Pinochet's security police, the DINA, including the agency's chief of operations Army Brig. Pedro Espinoza, and its director Army Gen. Manuel Contreras Sep·lveda, who reported directly to General Pinochet. In 1995, under strong U.S. pressure, both Contreras and Espinoza went to prison in Chile for the crime. In addition, one member of the military is in jail for an unrelated human rights crime committed in 1983. Even Pinochet's family members appear untouchable in Chile. In the early 1990's, government auditors were investigating Pinochet's son, Augusto Pinochet Hiriart, in a $7 million corruption case involving military-run businesses. In May 1993, citing discontent over issues including this investigation, the army carried out a threateningly public military exercise in Santiago, the national capital. The then-government subsequently signed an agreement giving the army some power to monitor the Pinochet investigation. Under intense military pressure, the government of President Eduardo Frei was obliged to order the investigation closed in July 1995.

Following the publication of the exposés, which many observers characterized as a campaign targeting Betchine and other allies of President Zeroual, the government-owned printing presses on October 14 informed El-Watan, Le Matin, Le Soir d’Algérie and La Tribune that they would have to pay their debts in full within forty-eight hours. This demand reportedly contradicted an understanding reached between newspapers and printing presses earlier in 1998, and appeared to single out particular titles for their critical coverage.

Must Take Action on Human Rights in Burma","","11/09/1998","(New York) - As the United Nations General Assembly this week begins its annual consideration of human rights in Burma, Human Rights Watch urges U.N. member states to call on the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to immediately and unconditionally release opposition supporters and to ease restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and assembly. During the last three months, more than 200 members of the National League for Democracy (NLD) elected to parliament in 1990, as well as hundreds of local NLD organizers, students, and members of ethnic minorities suspected of being NLD supporters, have been arrested or detained for peaceful political activity. While over one hundred have been released, 544 NLD members were still in detention as of early November by the government's own count. The NLD has accused the authorities of forcing those in detention to answer questions on their political beliefs, sign statements that they do not support the NLD leadership, and charging those who refuse with a variety of different crimes. On October 21, further concerns about custodial treatment were raised when fifty-three-year-old U Aung Min, head of the NLD's Mandalay division office, died suddenly after forty-five days in detention from what the authorities described as """"lymph-gland cancer."""" He was previously being reported to be in good health.  The SPDC says it was forced to take draconian measures such as mass arrests because the NLD had embarked on a political confrontation that could destabilize the country. The real aim, however, appears to be to quash all signs of dissent, even as international concern over developments in Burma is growing. In September and October, the European Union called for tougher sanctions against Burma, including the banning of even transit visas for SPDC officials. The U.K. government called for Burma's expulsion from the International Labor Organization in protest against its continued use of forced labor. The World Bank severed financial relations with the SPDC for Burma's failure to repay past loans. A report issued in September by Justice Rajsoomer Lallah, Special Rapporteur on Burma for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, was a devastating critique of the country's human rights practices. On October 7, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, deplored the """"intensifying wave of repression"""" and urged the SPDC government """"to undertake a process of reconciliation with the opposition and cooperate fully with the human rights mechanisms of the United Nations."""" And in late October, U.N. special envoy Alvaro de Soto visited Rangoon in an effort to see whether the political impasse that led to the crackdown could be broken. Two weeks later, that question remained unanswered. Background to the Crackdown The arrests were triggered by the NLD's announcement that it would give the SPDC until August 21 to allow the parties that had won the 1990 elections to convene a """"people's parliament"""" in line with the poll results. The NLD was the overwhelming winner in those elections, but the military government never allowed the elected parliament to meet. Instead, it continued to insist that political reform had to be preceded by constitutional change, and that change could only be debated or introduced by its own hand-picked National Convention, instituted in January 1993 by the then State Law and Order Council (SLORC), the SPDC's predecessor in name. The NLD withdrew, and was subsequently banned, from the convention in November 1995, in protest against pervasive restrictions on freedom of expression and association. Subsequent attempts at rapprochement came to nothing. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other NLD leaders therefore asserted that they had only set the August 21 deadline after eight years of trying to initiate meaningful dialogue with the government. The government responded to the ultimatum by intensifying security operations around the country, arguing that any attempt to convene a parliament would be illegal without a new constitution in place. Aung San Suu Kyi herself twice staged roadside protests in her vehicle for a total of eighteen days after she was blocked by security forces during a series of attempts to travel outside Rangoon. Only ill-health forced her return to the capital. At the same time, growing numbers of local party members were detained or forced to report daily to the district authorities to prevent them from traveling to any parliamentary meetings. Official visas to foreign journalists were also halted, and eighteen foreign visitors (from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, the U.S. and Australia) were sentenced to five-year jail terms under the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, then deported from the country, after being accused of handing out """"subversive literature"""" commemorating the 1988 pro-democracy demonstrations. The crisis then rapidly worsened in late August and early September when the SPDC launched the most sustained crackdown on the NLD and other pro-democracy groups since shortly after the 1990 election. Over 1,000 opposition supporters were detained in a campaign of mass arrests, some for relatively short periods. Subsequently, state television and the government's Internet website showed pictures of a number of the detained parliamentarians at government guesthouses where, it was claimed, they were being well-cared for after being """"invited by the government to ask for their cooperation to help maintain the current peace, stability and development of the nation."""" On September 14, eighty-five-year-old Thakin Khin Nyunt, the parliamentarian elected in 1990 from Yenanchaung constituency, was released as a humanitarian gesture, but the same day the NLD reported that other party members were being detained or charged with crimes, including U Kyi Toe and U Aung Than Nyunt of the NLD's Chauk Township Organizing Committee, who both, the NLD stated, received seven years' imprisonment with hard labor under Article 16 of the Penal Code, apparently for the """"crime"""" of distributing NLD materials. The political crisis then intensified on September 16 after the NLD decided on the formation of a ten-person """"Committee Representing the People's Parliament"""" (CRPP). Except for Aung San Suu Kyi, U Tin Oo, and U Aye Thar Aung (an ethnic minority representative), the members were all elected parliamentarians. Claiming the mandate of over 50 percent of the parliamentarians elected in 1990 (251 of the 485 MPs), the CRPP began to act like a legislative body. It first announced that all laws decreed by the SLORC/SPDC since 1988 were invalid unless approved by the people's parliament. To legalize its existence, the CRPP then approved the 1990 election law, but it swiftly moved on to repealing what it described as """"repressive"""" legislation from earlier political eras, singling out the widely-used 1950 Emergency Provisions Act and the 1975 State Protection Law, both of which the CRPP """"revoked"""" on September 28. It also criticized what it described as the government's """"violations of the law,"""" including the misuse of the Penal Code, the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, and the 1961 Habitual Criminal Offenders Act to detain or restrict NLD members. The CRPP has also called for the right for the NLD to hold public meetings and for the amendment of the Citizens' Rights Protection Law to include the protection of basic rights of individuals vis-a-vis the state.  To date, the SPDC has taken no direct action against the CRPP, which it terms the """"Gang of Ten."""" It does, however, regard the creation of the CRPP as one of several """"whimsical"""" measures taken by the NLD that it sees as endangering the government's political and economic reform process, and has justified the mass detentions accordingly. Commentaries in the official Burmese-language media have been far more vitriolic. The NLD has been repeatedly accused of treachery, and Aung San Suu Kyi has been personally attacked and accused of foreign allegiances, largely on account of having a British husband. Such attacks have been repeated at government-organized rallies across the country, where representatives of different citizens' groups have denounced the NLD. The denunciations are then frequently broadcast on state television. At one rally at Keng Tung in the eastern Shan state on October 8, speakers called for the deportation of Aung San Suu Kyi and accused the NLD, the """"minion of neo-colonialists,"""" of """"inciting unrest"""" with foreign assistance to try and gain power. At another rally on October 20 in Sittwe, Rakhine state, speakers accused Aung San Suu Kyi of a """"wicked scheme"""" to obtain power through """"impoverishing the people"""" by calling for international trade boycotts. Ethnic Minorities The loyalty of Burma's ethnic minorities has also become a key issue between the NLD and the government. In late September, the government warned that the NLD's campaign to convene parliament could lead to the """"disintegration of the Union"""" by causing distrust between the government and ethnic minority peoples, who make up an estimated third of the country's 48 million population. In announcing the people's parliament, the NLD claimed that it had the support of four ethnic nationality parties which together had won forty-one seats in the 1990 election: the Arakan (or Rakhine) League for Democracy, Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, Mon National Democracy Front, and the Zomi National Congress. These four parties were also represented in the CRPP. As a result, a number of ethnic minority parliamentarians were reported to have been taken into detention during the crackdown, including eighty-year-old Dr. Saw Mra Aung of the Arakan League for Democracy, who has been named chairman of the people's parliament by the CRPP, and Nai Ngwe Thein, Dr. Min Soe Lin, and Dr. Min Kyi Win of the Mon National Democracy Front. The last three have since been charged under the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, according to opposition sources. Pressures on ethnic minority groups further escalated when the NLD/CRPP announced that four different ethnic groups that had concluded ceasefire agreements with the government—the Karenni Nationalities People's Liberation Front, Shan State Nationalities Liberation Organization, Kayan New Land Party, and New Mon State Party—also supported the NLD's parliamentary call. The agreement of ceasefires with most of the country's major ethnic insurgent organizations has been one of the military government's most-publicized achievements since 1989. The CRPP's claim of ethnic minority support thus prompted the SPDC to repeatedly urge the ceasefire groups to publicly reject the NLD's people's parliament. Eventually, over a dozen parties did so, although many were clearly reluctant to take sides in a struggle they privately wanted the NLD and SPDC to resolve between themselves. Said the Kachin Independence Organization (KIO) in an official statement on October 6: """"The KIO emphatically suggests that various parties and organizations, which have different viewpoints, eradicate bitterness and emnity through processes of coordination, thereby reaching an agreement to cooperate, in the interest of the Union and the entire people."""" Students and NGOs The clearest evidence of the SPDC's intention to quash any opposition came with the October 7 press statement by Col. Thein Swe of the Office of Strategic Studies. Claiming a complex conspiracy """"to incite anarchy"""" on the part of the NLD, student organizations, armed opposition groups and foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the military authorities announced that fifty-four people, including twenty-three NLD members and some students, had been arrested. The SPDC's accusations, and the arrests of the students, were made after several small student protests broke out in Rangoon during August and September. At the time, the authorities appeared to be trying to reopen the country's universities, which had been closed since earlier student demonstrations in December 1996. The SPDC therefore charged that the NLD and other democracy activists were using the students as a cover to try and cause greater volatility and support for the people's parliament. In fact, eyewitnesses contended that most of the protests were over local student grievances, especially those at Rangoon Institute of Technology where returning students discovered that they would immediately be required to sit exams without time for study or revision. Indeed, even in the SPDC's published accusations there is no evidence that those arrested were involved in anything other than peaceful political activities. The government has not released the names of any of those detained, but, according to opposition sources, those arrested include Tun Myint Aung, Myo Min Zaw, Yan Aung Soe, and Thet Win Aung, who were members or allies of the All Burma Federation of Student Unions (ABFSU), and the NLD parliamentarians, U Toe Bo from Yebyu Constituency, and U Soe Myint of Minbu Constituency-1, who was also librarian at Aung San Suu Kyi's Rangoon compound. In his statement, Col. Thein Swe attempted to connect these people to a line of instructions from underground or armed opposition groups along the Thai-Burma border, including the Democratic Party for New Society, All Burma Students Democratic Front, and Karen National Union. Student groups in Burma, however, claim that the latest arrests mark the acceleration of a government clampdown on a new generation of students. The security services previously had concentrated on the 1988 generation of pro-democracy students, whose leader, Min Ko Naing, remains in prison amid continuing concerns about his state of health. Following the arrest early this year of the ABFSU central committee member Aung Tun, who had been writing a history of the student movement, the authorities began detaining individuals and breaking up literary groups or circles, a popular vehicle by which students have traditionally met and organized. According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Burma, Aung Tun was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment in March under Article 5(j) of the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act and the 1962 Printers and Publishers Registration Law. The Special Rapporteur also reported that another student leader, Aung Kyaw Moe, who was serving a 14 year jail term in Thayawaddy Prison, died in the prison hospital on May 23 """"after being beaten by prison authorities."""" The ABFSU itself calculates as many as 500 students have been detained in recent months and has provided Human Rights Watch with the names of sixty-five students and NLD youth members whom it believes are currently detained. The SPDC has also accused the international media and four foreign NGOs—the Open Society Institute of the international financier George Soros, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the US-based National Endowment for Democracy and the Canadian International Center for Human Rights and Democratic Development—of supporting the recent unrest and protests, principally through assistance to border-based groups, expatriates and individuals in Thailand. """"NGOs in the name of democracy are using all possible devious means and exerting all kinds of pressure to destabilize the internal situation,"""" said Col. Thein Swe. This is a charge the Jesuit Refugee Service (JRS) swiftly denied. In short, after three months of escalating tensions and constant security pressures, the human rights situation remains grim, and the political situation remains deadlocked. The prospects for a genuine dialogue between government and opposition have dimmed over the issue of Aung San Suu Kyi's participation in any talks. The SPDC regards her as """"an unelected private citizen"""" and """"celebrity"""" whom it would be inappropriate to include in official meetings. The NLD, according to the government, is insisting that she take part in any talks. As long as the impasse remains unresolved, the arrest, detention, and intimidation of NLD members and supporters is likely to continue.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)","United Nations"

In the 165-page report, Human Rights Watch blames government leaders for failing to tackle authoritarian laws on free expression imposed by the military, as well as some that predate military rule. """"Scraping a little below the democratic veneer, one finds a deep distrust of free debate,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"Civilian leaders are still afraid of the enormous influence of Augusto Pinochet in Chilean society. This is the legacy of his seventeen years of dictatorship.""""     General Pinochet, who returned the government to civilians in 1990, was detained in London on October 16, 1998, on charges of crimes against humanity filed by a Spanish judge.     Chile's 1958 State Security Law criminalizes strongly-worded criticism of government authorities, military chiefs, Supreme Court justices, and even members of Congress. Such criticism is deemed an offense against public order, punishable by a prison sentence of up to five years. Since 1990, eight politicians and fifteen journalists have been arrested and charged under the law. The law has been an important tool for General Pinochet to persecute his human rights critics.     Congress and members of the judiciary have also brought several suits based on the State Security Law. One former Pinochet minister was given a suspended sentence in 1996 for insulting Congress, a case now under consideration by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights of the Organization of American States. """"This law stifles legitimate political debate, no matter who initiates the prosecution,"""" said Vivanco. He urged President Eduardo Frei to seek immediate repeal of the law.     Several articles of the military penal code also limit political criticism. Military tribunals have responsibility for trying the crime of sedition, for example, which deprives civilian critics of the right to be judged by an independent and impartial court. Current laws allow judges to ban any press coverage of court proceedings on controversial criminal cases, and thereby to conceal possible shortcomings in investigations and trial procedures.     The report charges that judges meticulously implement the letter of the law, but fail to take into account basic human rights principles. """"In recent years, we have seen judges putting constitutional rights into a hierarchy, with freedom of expression consistently ranking below other rights, such as honor or privacy,"""" said Vivanco. Judges used this argument to ban a book freely available in Argentina (journalist Francisco Martorell's Diplomatic Impunity) and a film widely available outside the country (Martin Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ).     Film censorship, although less prevalent today than under the military government, is still explicitly mandated by the Constitution and is practiced by an undemocratic agency that largely works in secret, the Council of Cinematographic Evaluation. Chilean television has been at the center of a public debate recently due to the unpopularity of restrictions affecting cable, which now reaches 25 percent of Chilean homes. These restrictions include both tight government regulations on broadcasts depicting sex and violence, as well as the editorial policy of local cable operators, who routinely cut programs and films offered by international cable companies.     The Human Rights Watch report found self-censorship widespread in television, partly because the government's television watchdog body strictly enforces ill-defined regulations on morality. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch stated, directors at the public channel, Television Nacional, have increasingly sacrificed pluralism in favor of opinions unlikely to give offense, making it difficult to find programs of real critical content anywhere in the medium.","Americas, Chile","International Justice, Free Speech"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/11/06/pinochet-extradition-hearings","Pinochet Extradition Hearings","Pinochet Extradition Hearings","A Human Rights Watch Update, November 6, 1998","11/06/1998","The House of Lords has completed two days of hearings about the detention of Augusto Pinochet.  Lawyers for the Crown, representing Spanish authorities who are seeking extradition, presented arguments and answered questions from the five-member panel of judges. The lawyers for Pinochet, who will argue against extradition, have not yet pled their case.     The hearing will resume on Monday, November 9, and is expected to conclude early next week. Human Rights Watch has prepared the following background to help untangle some highly complex legal issues.    What is the legal question before the House of Lords?     According to the certification of appeal from the High Court, which held last week that Pinochet was immune from arrest, the Law Lords must decide """"the scope of the immunity enjoyed by a former head of state"""" for acts committed when he was head of state. The British law supposedly conferring this immunity is the State Immunity Act. That law actually derives from an ancient doctrine dating back to the time of kings, when state authority was fully vested in the sovereign. In those days, the state and the ruler were considered one and the same.    On what basis did the High Court rule that Pinochet had immunity?     The State Immunity Act says that heads of state are not subject to civil or criminal process in the United Kingdom; they can't be sued or prosecuted for any criminal acts. Section 14-1 of the law gives immunity to """"the sovereign or other head of state acting in his public capacity.""""    The law contains two major ambiguities that lie at the core of the case: Does the law apply to former heads of state?     In a highly significant move, the High Court ruled that it does. In most democratic countries, a former head of state would not have immunity from prosecution for the kind of crimes Pinochet committed. What does the term """"acting in public capacity"""" really mean? The High Court suggested that Pinochet's crimes were in fact an exercise of the power that he had by virtue of being head of state. One of the three judges on the Court said that """"unfortunately, history has shown that it has indeed been state policy sometimes to suppress particular groups.""""     Human Rights Watch rejects the notion that any head of state, current or former, can be immune from prosecution for such serious crimes. The notion that torture and murder could be construed as acts in """"public capacity"""" ignores the fact that they are completely illegitimate, and illegal both under international law and under the domestic law of the U.K., Chile, and just about everywhere else.    Should the State Immunity Act be the only law applied in Pinochet's case?     The High Court has interpreted the State Immunity Act very broadly. But the ambiguities in the term """"public capacity"""" should compel the Law Lords to look elsewhere in British law and British legal obligations to determine their ruling. Where domestic law is vague, the Lords should look to international law for guidance.     For example, Britain has legal obligations under the Convention against Torture, to which it is a party, and which contains no ambiguities whatsoever: it requires the government either to prosecute Pinochet or extradite him to a country that will.     Indeed, international law recognizes no exemptions for a head of state. The Nuremberg tribunal established this principle very clearly; its charter reads: """"The official position of defendants, whether as heads of state or responsible officials in Government Departments, shall not be considered as freeing them from responsibility or mitigating punishment."""" These principles have been recognized by the General Assembly of the United Nations as international law. They have been repeated in almost identical terms in the Genocide Convention, in the statutes establishing tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and in the treaty for the new international criminal court.    What is a crime against humanity?     Isolated acts of torture, murder, and disappearances are not crimes against humanity. The crimes in question must be very serious, and they must be """"widespread or systematic,"""" in order to invoke international law. Pinochet's crimes certainly qualify.    Why is British law even relevant to a Spanish extradition request?     Under most extradition treaties, a government can extradite someone only if they could also prosecute them. In other words, the United States would not extradite someone to Belarus for the crime of defaming the president, because that is not a crime in the U.S. Torture is a crime under British law, so Pinochet could certainly be prosecuted in Britain -- if he is judged not to have immunity.     However, if the High Court's judgment is reversed, Pinochet will not immediately be extradited. The current legal proceeding only concerns the arrest warrant issued by Scotland Yard. If Pinochet loses, his lawyers can mount another challenge when Spain finally makes its formal request for extradition.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/11/05/yugoslavia-blocks-war-crimes-investigation","Yugoslavia Blocks War Crimes Investigation","Yugoslavia Blocks War Crimes Investigation","","11/05/1998","(New York) - Human Rights Watch strongly condemned the Yugoslav government for denying visas to a team of investigators from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).   The tribunal submitted its visa requests to the Yugoslav authorities on October 15, days after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic promised U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke that war crimes investigators would have access to Kosovo. The tribunal's Chief Prosecutor, Louise Arbour, requested visas for herself and a team of ten investigators to visit Kosovo and investigate allegations of war crimes committed by both sides in the conflict between the Yugoslav authorities and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).   Yesterday Arbour was informed that the team would be allowed to visit only Belgrade, not Kosovo; that only two investigators would be allowed to accompany her and her deputy; and that the visa would permit only a single entry, for seven days. The Yugoslav authorities further told Arbour that her team would not be permitted to conduct any investigations during its trip to Belgrade. The Prosecutor has declined to accept the limited visa offered.   """"Once again, Slobodan Milosevic has bought himself time with empty promises,"""" stated Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"If he is allowed to get away with this, it will be like giving him a green light to continue his repressive campaign, and the peace process in Kosovo will be doomed before it even starts.""""   The Yugoslav authorities have obstructed the work of the tribunal since its inception, harboring suspects indicted for crimes committed in Bosnia and, more recently, refusing to accept that the tribunal has jurisdiction over crimes committed in Kosovo. In recent statements, Yugoslav government authorities have claimed that the International Tribunal's competence to investigate events in Kosovo had ended upon conclusion of the Holbrooke agreements. In a concession to Milosevic, the U.S. negotiators left out reference to the ICTY in those agreements, referring instead to Security Council resolutions, which in turn acknowledge the right of the tribunal to investigate in Kosovo. """"Unfortunately, the U.S. negotiators missed a crucial opportunity-when the threat of NATO airstrikes had Milosevic at the bargaining table-to reaffirm Milosevic's obligation to cooperate with the tribunal,"""" said Cartner. """"Their concession was obviously a grave error.""""   Yugoslav government officials have also argued that the tribunal has no rights to investigate in Kosovo because the violence did not constitute an """"armed conflict,"""" a requirement of tribunal jurisdiction. Human Rights Watch has concluded that an armed conflict commenced in Kosovo on February 28, when Serbian special police forces launched their first large-scale, military attack on villages. From that date, the Kosovo Liberation Army and the government were engaged in ongoing hostilities involving military offensives, front lines, and the use of attack helicopters and heavy artillery. At times, as much as 40% of Kosovo territory was controlled by the KLA, which is an organized force led by regional commanders, capable of organizing systematic attacks and imposing discipline on their fighters.   Since March, the Security Council has repeatedly called for a tribunal investigation in Kosovo, implicitly acknowledging that an armed conflict was taking place. On July 7, the Prosecutor explicitly stated that she had concluded that the nature and scale of the conflict indicated that an armed conflict was taking place. The U.S. government has also publicly endorsed this conclusion. """"There is no question that an armed conflict has been taking place in Kosovo,"""" Cartner said. """"Moreover, such legal challenges to the tribunal's jurisdiction should be raised before the tribunal's judges, after an indictment has been brought and a suspect arrested, not by a government as a bar to an investigation.""""   Human Rights Watch has conducted three investigations to Kosovo this year and documented serious violations, committed disproportionately by the Yugoslav forces. The organization is particularly eager for international investigators to reach massacre sites its researchers uncovered last month. """"We have documented the summary executions and indiscriminate shelling that have taken the lives of hundreds of civilians and sent thousands into hiding in the woods,"""" stated Cartner.

Last week, the British High Court cited the State Immunity Act of 1978 in rejecting Spain's request to extradite Pinochet. But the court's ruling contradicts a growing international consensus that no one should enjoy impunity for crimes against humanity. """"A growing number of states are willing to apply international law at home,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch in New York. """"It's high time for Britain to do the same. The House of Lords needs to be on the right side of history.""""  Human Rights Watch, the largest human rights organization based in the United States, is presenting a written intervention to the House of Lords, showing that international law offers no immunity for perpetrators of the gravest human rights crimes, no matter who they are or where they are. Roth noted that Britain adheres to several treaties, conventions, and international customary laws that contradict the State Immunity Act. They include the Genocide Convention, the Convention Against Torture, and the precedents established by various war crimes tribunals. Fifty years ago, the Nuremberg trials established the principle of no sovereign immunity for crimes against humanity.  Currently, heads of state do not enjoy immunity at the two war crimes tribunals set up by the United Nations in 1993 and 1994. The ex-prime minister of Rwanda, Jean Kambanda, could not use sovereign immunity to avoid prosecution for genocide: he pled guilty before the Rwanda tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania. Nor could Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, if he is indicted, claim immunity before the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague. Britain has strongly supported the same principle for the new international criminal court. In four years of negotiations on the court, there was absolutely no debate over immunity for heads of state. The founding treaty, concluded in Rome this summer, explicitly states that the official position of the accused is irrelevant to a prosecution. Britain was among the 120 nations who voted for the treaty; only seven voted against. Judges in the United States have rejected the idea that gross violations of human rights are covered by sovereign immunity. In cases dealing with former Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos and former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega, U.S. federal courts have ruled that sovereign immunity does not apply to prosecutions for """"criminal acts."""" Several countries, including Canada and Belgium, have passed """"enabling"""" legislation to make it easier for their courts to try people accused of human rights crimes committed anywhere in the world.  Some European countries have already asked for Pinochet's extradition. Victims of Pinochet's crimes from several countries, assisted by Human Rights Watch and others, are petitioning the European Court of Human Rights to prevent the former dictator's return to Chile even if the House of Lords upholds the High Court's ruling.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Chile, United Kingdom","International Justice"

Abdul Malik Pahlavan of Afghanistan. As you are aware, Gen. Malik is believed to be responsible for the summary executions of Taliban prisoners following a failed coup attempt against General Dostum of the Junbish-i Milli-yi Islami in May 1997. Hundreds of Taliban were attacked in Mazar-i Sharif and killed at that time, and at least 2,000 taken prisoner, only to be summarily executed by Malik's forces. Their bodies were dumped in wells or taken to remote desert sites and left lying in the open. We understand that other factions also played a role in the attacks on the Taliban, including the Hizb-i Wahdat, whose members reportedly gunned down Taliban troops in the streets and may have killed some of those in custody.  While it is clear that virtually every faction in Afghanistan is responsible for grave abuses of international humanitarian law, we believe that the State Department has to draw a line in cases where there strong evidence that someone is personally responsible for gross abuses. We understand that the State Department routinely meets with representatives of various Afghan factions with an aim of promoting a dialogue that might lead to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, and we support such efforts. We also understand that such meetings should not be construed as an endorsement of the policies or actions of any particular faction. However, Gen. Malik does not represent just another faction in Afghanistan. Under international law, the killings for which he is believed responsible represent crimes against humanity. No perpetrator of such crimes should even be granted the courtesy of a meeting at the State Department. The aim of diplomacy is not to protect individuals accused of mass murder.  Instead, the U.S. should be using its influence to ensure that there be a thorough investigation by an impartial body of the May 1997 killings in Mazar-i Sharif and the subsequent massacre in August 1998, when the Taliban captured the city. On the basis of evidence uncovered during such investigations, it may be possible to bring to justice some of those responsible for gross abuses in Afghanistan, including Gen. Malik. But the first objective of these investigations should be to establish the truth about the killings and other abuses that took place. The U.S. can and should play a leading role in this by urging that governments in the region as well as concerned agencies and departments in the U.N. support such an investigation.

""""We're obviously deeply concerned about aspects of Mr. Anwar's arrest, detention, and trial,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"But we're equally concerned about the government's reliance on the Internal Security Act and what appear to be growing restrictions on freedom of expression and assembly that affect a much larger number of people.""""  Human Rights Watch has sent two observers to the trial, Mr. Wesley Gryk, a London-based lawyer, and Ms. Jeannine Guthrie, a staff member of the organization's Asia division. Human Rights Watch will be looking at the impartiality of the government's inquiry into the beatings Mr. Anwar endured on the night of his arrest, and whether anyone is prosecuted as a result. It will examine the question of whether Mr. Anwar and his lawyers had adequate time to prepare a defense, given the initial difficulties the lawyers had getting access to their client after Mr. Anwar was detained under the Internal Security Act. It will inquire about any undue pressure on witnesses, especially in light of allegations by the two men convicted of sodomy that they were forced to plead guilty under duress. And it will watch for any indications of a less than fully independent judiciary, not only in this trial on four counts of corruption, but in forthcoming trials, both of Mr. Anwar, on the remaining six charges against him, and of his associates. The trial of one of the latter, businessman K.S. Nallakaruppan, opens on November 9; he is charged with illegal possession of ammunition under a section of the ISA which carries a mandatory death sentence.  Human Rights Watch also noted that the following serious human rights violations had taken place in recent months in connection with Mr Anwar's case. Use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) The ISA, a holdover from the British colonial administration, gives the police unacceptably broad powers of search and detention and restrictions on freedom of movement, speech, association, and assembly. It has been used to detain Anwar supporters and associates, and lawyers representing those detainees have themselves been called in for questioning, in violation of the privileged lawyer-client relationship. Anwar Ibrahim is no longer in ISA detention, but the repeated use of the law in recent months is cause for concern. Human Rights Watch wholeheartedly endorses a resolution passed unanimously on October 10 by the Malaysian Bar Council, calling for the repeal of the ISA.  Restrictions on Freedom of Assembly Since September, the Malaysian government has banned peaceful political rallies linked to Mr. Anwar, both those in support of reform and those to protest his arrest and detention. To justify the ban, the government has variously argued that the organizers lacked a permit, that they were endangering security, or that they were not lawfully registered. The government has also cited a court ruling on October 5 banning any discussion suggesting Anwar's guilt or innocence prior to the conclusion of the trial. The fact that the government has used so many different reasons suggests that it is more concerned about the message delivered in these public gatherings than the procedures followed by the organizers. Hundreds of people who took part in such """"illegal assemblies"""" have been charged under the Police Act and face up to one year in prison or a heavy fine. Restrictions on Freedom of Expression Besides banning reform rallies under the Police Act, police have forbidden Dr. Wan Azizah, Anwar's wife, from addressing public meetings. They have also threatened to arrest her for statements she made in an interview in September expressing the fear that Anwar might be injected with HIV while in custody to """"prove"""" charges of homosexuality. International journalists who interviewed her were visited in Singapore by Malaysian police as part of an investigation of Wan Azizah on possible sedition charges. Malaysian authorities have also announced surveillance of all Internet communications regarding the arrest of Anwar. Newspapers in which the ruling party, UMNO, is a major shareholder, such as Utusan Malaysia, have pressured editors and journalists to follow the party line on Anwar or face dismissal. Excessive Use of Force by Police Anwar and other detainees allege that they were beaten by police, denied sleep, or subjected to threats or other psychological abuse. Mr. Anwar's black eye and bruised arm generated international outrage and suggest that arresting officers violated a key principle of the United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officers, namely that """"Law enforcement officials may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty."""" Moreover, the first principle of the U.N.Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any form of Detention or Imprisonment states that """"All persons under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be treated in a humane manner and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person."""" Restrictions on Freedom of Association The Malaysian University Act forbids students from participating in opposition politics, a law that Human Rights Watch believes is inherently restrictive of freedom of association. In September, Education Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak announced that the ministry was monitoring students involved in Anwar's """"reformasi"""" or reform movement. Student supporters from the Mara Institute of Technology were threatened with expulsion and blacklisting from government educational institutions for being involved in Anwar's campaigns. Six students from Universiti Utara Malaysia were arrested and subsequently suspended for involvement in political activity related to a September parliamentary by-election. Violations of the Right to Privacy Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that """"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home, and correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation;"""" and that """"everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks."""" The public vilification, arrest and prosecution of Anwar and his associates in connection with allegations of homosexual activity are a violation of that right. Whether or not the allegations are true, the section of the Penal Code banning """"carnal intercourse against the order of nature"""" violates the fundamental human right to privacy, to the extent that the ban covers consensual, private sexual acts between adults.","Asia, Malaysia",""

Investigation of Massacre","11/01/1998","(New York) -- An August massacre of civilians by Taliban troops in Mazar-i Sharif is one of the worst atrocities of Afghanistan's long civil war, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today.   Human Rights Watch is the first international human rights organization to interview survivors of the massacre who reached safety in Pakistan. According to eyewitnesses quoted in the report, Taliban troops taking control of Mazar-i Sharif sought out and executed members of the Hazara ethnic group, who are Sh'ia Muslims. The Taliban are believers in a strict version of Sunni Islam.  """"In a very brutal war, this is a particularly brutal episode,"""" said Patricia Gossman, senior researcher of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"We are talking about the systematic execution of perhaps 2,000 civilians, in large part because of their ethnic and religious identity."""" The massacre began when Taliban troops entered the northern Afghanistan city on August 8, shooting at """"anything that moved"""" in what witnesses described as a """"killing frenzy."""" In the days that followed, the troops conducted house-to-house searches, arresting and executing Hazara men and boys. Eyewitnesses reported that troops demanded they recite Sunni prayers to prove they were not Hazara. Scores and perhaps hundreds of Hazara men and boys were summarily executed, apparently to ensure that they would be unable to mount any resistance to the Taliban.  During these days of terror in Mazar, the Taliban governor, Mulla Manon Niazi, delivered many speeches inciting violence against Hazaras and accusing them of killing Taliban troops, including prisoners, in a 1997 battle. These speeches clearly indicate that the killings were not the actions of renegade forces, but had the sanction of Taliban authorities. Taliban troops detained thousands of men from various ethnic communities. The men were held first in the overcrowded city jail, and then transported to other cities, including Shiberghan, Herat and Qandahar. Most of the prisoners were transported in large container trucks capable of holding 100 to 150 people. In two known instances, nearly all of the men suffocated or died of heat stroke inside the closed metal containers. As of late October, some 4,500 men from Mazar remained in detention. Taliban troops also killed civilians in aerial bombardments and rocket attacks on panicked citizens fleeing southward out of the city, toward the Alborz mountains. Human Rights Watch is also concerned by persistent reports that women and girls, particularly in certain Hazara neighborhoods of Mazar-i Sharif, were raped and abducted during the Taliban takeover of the city.  As the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan submits his report to the U.N. General Assembly this week, Human Rights Watch urged the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to conduct a thorough investigation into the massacre and the full range of abuses that took place in Mazar-i Sharif. The Taliban apparently carried out the massacre in revenge for the killing of thousands of its own soldiers in Mazar in 1997. Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations to investigate that atrocity as well.  """"Determining the truth about what happened would represent the first step toward accountability,"""" said Gossman. """"It could also provide a means toward breaking the cycle of revenge killings that has characterized the civil war in Afghanistan."""" Human Rights Watch called on the international community to do everything possible to urge the Taliban to permit such an investigation to go forward. The U.N. Secretary-General should try to facilitate the mission, and all U.N. departments and agencies should lend their logistic support to it.","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Human Rights Watch is reliably informed that the five are currently being interrogated in Bukavu, together with some advisors of the former governor and some members of his family who stayed behind. Human Rights Watch condemns the violation by the Burundian authorities of the right of the five asylum seekers not to be forcibly returned to eastern Congo. We call on your government to identify and hold accountable those responsible for this grave violation of Burundi's international commitments not to forcibly return asylum seekers to a country where their human rights could be violated. With the escalation of the armed conflict and the deterioration of the human rights and humanitarian situation in neighboring Congo, we urge your government to give assurances not to arbitrarily detain or ill-treat asylum seekers from that or any other country. We urge your government to uphold its obligation to grant refugee status to those who seek and are entitled to it as provided for under the 1951 U.N.

""""The draft report offers all South Africans and the world at large the opportunity to learn from South Africa's suffering during apartheid. We call upon those responsible for the abuses committed by all sides to rise to this historical occasion and acknowledge their role in human rights abuses. Such acknowledgment is an essential step in reconciliation."""" At a ceremony in Pretoria today, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the chairperson of the Commission, handed over the five-volume report to President Nelson Mandela. The report documents the widespread human rights abuses committed during the apartheid era in South Africa, implicating many apartheid government officials as well as the ANC and other liberation organizations. Human Rights Watch expressed disappointment with the TRC's decision to excise findings from their draft report implicating the last president of the apartheid era, F.W. De Klerk. Human Rights Watch urged the TRC to take the necessary steps to ensure that all those proved responsible for abuses would be named in its final report. Human Rights Watch condemned the attempt by the ruling ANC to prevent the release of the draft report, and urged its leadership to take responsibility for the abuses committed during its liberation struggle. ANC Secretary-General Kgalema Motlanthe attempted to block the release of the TRC report through a court application which was rejected early today. In the application, the ANC accused the TRC of """"criminalizing the struggle for the liberation of the people of South Africa,"""" and argued that if the ANC had to be bound by the requirements of the laws of war, South Africa's liberation struggle might have failed. Human Rights Watch emphatically rejects the view advanced by the ANC that it should be held to a lower standard of scrutiny because it was fighting a just war against an oppressive system. The abuses committed by the ANC during its liberation struggle, including the targeting of innocent civilians in bombing campaigns and the torture and summary executions of suspected collaborators at ANC camps, cannot be justified by reference to the justice of its struggle. The objectives of any military or political campaign do not affect the obligations of all parties to respect the rules of war and the principles of international humanitarian law. """"The argument advanced by the ANC that they should not be held accountable for their abuses because they were committed in the furtherance of a legitimate struggle are directly contrary to the principles of international law,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We urge the ANC to take responsibility for the abuses committed by its forces during the apartheid era, and to stop hiding behind the legitimacy of its struggle against apartheid.""""

""""No one under the age of eighteen should take part in war, whether as part of a national army, an armed opposition group, or a member of a UN peacekeeping mission,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"Existing international standards to keep children out of armed conflict are completely inadequate. This new policy is a major step forward."""" Announcing the new policy today in the Fourth Committee of the General Assembly, Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Bernard Miyet also stated that contributing governments are asked not to send military observers and civilian police younger than twenty-five years old, and that other peacekeeping troops should preferably be at least twenty-one, and definitely not younger than eighteen.  Human Rights Watch urged national governments to reflect the new UN policy in their domestic legislation. """"The use of child combatants has become one of the most devastating aspects of contemporary warfare,"""" said Becker, who is also steering committee chair of the international Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers. """"National governments should be doing everything possible to stop this horrible practice. Raising their enlistment age to eighteen is one important move."""" The latest research on child soldiers estimates that more than 300,000 children under 18 years old are fighting in armed conflicts around the world. Although existing international law allows the recruitment of children as young as fifteen, there is a growing movement to raise the minimum age to eighteen. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, now ratified by nearly every country in the world, defines a child as anyone under eighteen years of age, and entitled to special care and protection. In late June, Human Rights Watch and other leading international nongovernmental organizations launched a new Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which seeks to raise the minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict from fifteen to eighteen, through an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  A U.N. working group mandated to draft such an optional protocol so far has failed to reach agreement on a text, despite four years of negotiations. The United States, supported by a small number of other states, has vigorously opposed an eighteen-year minimum for either military recruitment or participation in armed conflict, despite the fact that as one of only two countries that has failed to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child, it would not even be eligible to join the optional protocol.  On June 29, following a special UN Security Council debate, the Council issued a presidential statement condemning the targeting of children in armed conflict.

How to make peace among the parties to Colombia's war - the guerrillas, the government, and the paramilitaries frequently allied with the army - will be an important issue for President Pastrana's talks in Washington. In meetings with President Clinton, the State Department, and Congressional leaders, he will also discuss the direction of the war on drugs. President Pastrana is scheduled to address the National Press Club on Friday, October 30.  The civilian toll in Colombia's decades-long war remains alarmingly high. President Pastrana, who was elected in 1998, talks about peace, but has yet to take the measures necessary to end the targeting of civilians by the military and paramilitary groups. His new military high command has done no better. For their part, guerrillas continue to flout the laws of war even as they criticize government forces for violations. Crucial human rights legislation is stalled in Colombia's Congress, including a military penal code reform and a law criminalizing forced disappearances. So far, President Pastrana has failed to promote these measures, ignoring a unique opportunity to achieve crucial human rights reforms during his political """"honeymoon.""""  The Pastrana administration has yet to announce a plan for ending impunity for human rights crimes and military support for paramilitary groups. By law, when members of the armed forces are accused of violations of human rights, their cases should automatically be prosecuted in civilian courts. Nevertheless, the military continues to keep these cases in their own tribunals, where impunity is the rule. Pastrana should order his generals to comply fully with the law and dismiss those who fail to do so. Colombian human rights groups report that 619 people were killed for political reasons in the first six months of 1998, not counting deaths in combat. In cases where a perpetrator was suspected, 73 percent of these killings were attributed to paramilitaries, sometimes working with the support or acquiescence of the security forces; 17 percent were attributed to guerrillas; and 10 percent to state agents, in particular the Colombian army. (These figures come from the Data Bank run by the Center for Research and Popular Education and the Intercongregational Commission of Justice and Peace.) Human Rights Watch recently met with President Pastrana in Colombia and discussed these concerns: ARMY-PARAMILITARY TIES: Army officers who organize, tolerate, and fail to arrest or even pursue paramilitaries continue to be shielded from prosecution and even promoted. The army's attitude towards the forces responsible for the majority of atrocities against civilians is one of the principal obstacles to establishing respect for human rights in the conflict. Human Rights Watch has identified the following units with a pattern of support for paramilitaries, an estimated 75 percent of the Colombian army: the First, Second, and Fourth Divisions; the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh, Ninth, Fourteenth, and Seventeenth Brigades; Mobile Brigades One and Two; and the Barbacoas, Bárbula, Batín No. 6, Bomboná, Cacique Nutibara, Caycedo de Chaparral #17, Héroes de Majagual, Joaquín París, La Popa, Los Guanes, Girardot, Palonegro #50, Rafael Reyes, Ricuarte, Rogelio Correa Campos, and Santander Battalions.  Officers implicated in human rights violations and paramilitary activity who remain on staff include (in descending order of rank): Gen. Rafael Hernández López: Now chief of staff of the Colombian armed forces, General Hernández has been consistently implicated in support for paramilitary groups during his career. In 1993, he was commander of the Third Brigade in Cali and the immediate superior of Lt. Col. Luis Becerra Bohórquez, who allied with local paramilitaries to massacre thirteen members of the Ladino family living in Riofrío, Valle del Cauca. Since Hernández was Becerra's commanding officer, by Colombian law, he was also the first military judge to rule on the case. Hernández declared Becerra not guilty of any crime despite overwhelming evidence of his direct participation. Becerra was eventually dismissed from the army because of human rights violations. Gen. Jorge Mora Rangel: Currently head of Colombia's Army, General Mora authorized an illegal search of the offices of Justice and Peace, a respected human rights group, based on information provided by the Twentieth Brigade, an intelligence unit implicated in dozens of targeted killings and threats against human rights defenders. On May 13, 1998, soldiers forced employees to kneel at gunpoint, in order, they claimed, to take their pictures, an act more likely intended to inspire terror and evoke a summary execution. During the search, soldiers addressed employees as """"guerrillas"""" and filmed them and documents in the office. At one point, soldiers told the employees they wanted precise details of the office in order to later construct a scale model, apparently to plan further incursions. Soldiers also set up a camera to film human rights defenders gathered outside to show concern. Gen. Rito Alejo del Río Rojas: Director of Operations at Army headquarters in Bogotá, General del Río is under investigation by the Attorney General's Office for supporting and tolerating paramilitary activity in the Urabá region in 1996 and 1997, while he was commander of the Seventeenth Brigade. Human Rights Watch has documented dozens of cases involving joint army-paramilitary operations in Urabá while General del Río was in command. These reports were confirmed by a former colonel who worked under General del Río, who told authorities that General del Río maintained direct ties with paramilitaries.  Gen. Fernando Millán: While in command of the Fifth Brigade based in Bucaramanga, Santander, General Millán set up and supported the Las Colonias association in Lebrija, which regularly extorted money from residents and allegedly committed a series of killings, robberies, and death threats. Among its members, before its dismantling, were several known paramilitary members from the Middle Magdalena region. Nevertheless, the army high command, including current armed forces commander Gen. Fernando Tapias, prevented prosecutors from questioning Millán, then argued that the case involved official acts and should be tried before a military tribunal. In October, the case, like hundreds before it, was sent to a military tribunal where Millán will not likely be convicted. Fernando Millán was promoted to head the army's division level intelligence office on October 26. Gen. Jaime Uscátegui: Instead of being sanctioned for allowing repeated paramilitary massacres in his jurisdiction in 1997, Seventh Brigade Commander Uscátegui was promoted to an elite unit in the department of Caquetá in 1998. Uscátegui was again promoted on October 26 and is currently head of Colombia's War College. Among the massacres registered under his command was the July 1997 Mapiripán, Meta, massacre, by paramilitary units. Over a five-day period, paramilitaries killed at least thirteen people and threatened others with death. An investigation by the Attorney General's Office concluded that paramilitaries had arrived in the region via chartered airplane, which landed unhampered at the heavily militarized San José del Guaviare airport. Local army and police units ignored repeated phone calls from a civilian judge in the area asking for help to stop the slayings. The first person killed, Antonio María Herrera, was hung from a hook, and paramilitaries quartered his body, throwing the pieces into the Guaviare River. At least two bodies - those of Sinaí Blanco, a boatman, and Ronald Valencia, the airstrip manager - were decapitated.  Navy Lt. Col. Rodrigo Quiñones: There is overwhelming evidence showing that Lt. Col. Rodrigo Quiñones, commander of Naval Intelligence Network No. 7, planned and ordered over fifty extrajudicial executions in and around the city of Barrancabermeja, Santander from 1991 through 1993. Yet he and seven other soldiers were speedily acquitted by a military tribunal in 1994. Four years later, a civilian court convicted two civilian employees of Naval Intelligence Network No. 7. In his ruling, the civilian judge described himself as """"perplexed"""" by the military acquittals of the officers involved, since he considered the evidence against the officers """"irrefutable... With [this acquittal] all that [the military] does is justify crime, since the incidents and the people responsible for committing them are more than clear,"""" he wrote. In September, Colombia's Internal Affairs office (Procuraduría) also concluded that naval officers had formed, promoted, led, and financed paramilitary groups in order to carry out dozens of extrajudicial executions. However, they recommended only that a """"letter of punishment"""" be placed in his employment file. Quiñones remains on active duty. HUMAN RIGHTS DEFENDERS: So far in 1998, six human rights defenders have been killed in Colombia, among them government officials charged with investigating complaints about rights abuses, as well as nongovernmental human rights defenders. Among the most dangerous departments for human rights work was Antioquia. On February 27, 1998, three assassins gunned down human rights lawyer Jesús María Valle Jaramillo, president of the """"Héctor Abad Gómez"""" Permanent Committee for Human Rights in Antioquia, in his MedellÍn office. He was the fourth president of the committee killed since 1987. As of this writing, two men with links to paramilitaries were under arrest in connection with the murder. Less that two months after Valle's murder, three assassins killed human rights lawyer Eduardo Umaña in his Bogotá apartment. During a strike of state employees on October 19, Jaime Ortega, vice-president of one of Colombia's largest unions and a human rights defender, was killed. Ortega had been the target of repeated death threats over the years and had made many requests for government protection, including on the day before his murder. Nevertheless, the government had delayed providing him with a bodyguard, and Ortega was alone when he was shot by a gunman outside his Bogotá apartment. Over US $1 million that the government had promised in May to protect human rights defenders and their offices has yet to be spent on even the most basic measures recommended by police, including bullet-proof glass, video surveillance cameras, and reinforced doors.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

On October 9, the Commission called for an investigation into mass killings and other abuses by government troops in Monrovia in September. Since then, credible reports indicate that an arrest warrant was issued for Mr. Samuel Kofi Woods, president of the Commission. Mr. Woods - a well-known activist and former Reebok Human Rights Award winner - has been a long-standing independent voice for human rights through years of civil war and repression in Liberia.   The harassment of members of the Justice and Peace Commission appears to be part of a larger attempt by the Taylor government to curb freedom of expression and freedom of association in Liberia.   The full text of the letter is attached.     October 22, 1998   H.E. Charles Taylor President of the Republic of Liberia Office of the President, Executive Mansion P.O. Box 9001, Capitol Hill Monrovia, Liberia  Dear President Taylor:   Over the past several weeks, Human Rights Watch has become increasingly concerned about the safety of human rights defenders in Liberia. We are particularly alarmed by the recent harassment and intimidation of a leading human rights organization, the Justice and Peace Commission (JPC) of the National Catholic Secretariat, and in particular of Samuel Kofi Woods, its president.   The recent episodes of harassment seem to be related to a statement issued by the JPC on October 9, which condemned the latest rounds of violence and impunity in Liberia and called upon your government to investigate the serious incidents in September. In particular, the statement focused on reports of mass killings in Monrovia by security forces, the persecution of ethnic Krahns, the killings at the Post Stockade, and the American Embassy shootings. Shortly after the statement was issued, the organization received credible information that a warrant had been issued for Mr. Woods' arrest. On October 12, security forces were seen in the vicinity of his residence, apparently with orders to arrest him. Later that day, Mr. Woods' vehicle and a VHF radio were impounded by police and his driver was briefly detained.   Other members of the JPC were also summoned by your government to explain the JPC statement. In the intervening days, security forces have apparently returned to Woods' residence inquiring about his whereabouts. This obvious attempt to intimidate and silence prominent voices of civil society is extremely troubling for those in the international community who have hoped that respect for human rights might finally be realized in Liberia.   We fear that the actions against the JPC are not isolated, given recent reports about a governmental ban on the press from publishing information on the Internet. Reports indicate that your Minister of Information has prohibited newspapers from enjoying the newly acquired ability to publish materials on the Internet. We are concerned that this ban and the intimidation of civil society constitute a serious attack on freedom of expression and association in Liberia. We respectfully request that your government clarify its position on this ban and ensure that the press and all Liberians with links to the Internet have unfettered access. Civil society in Liberia--including human rights monitoring groups and the independent press--have played a critical role in demanding respect for human rights in Liberia, and consequently have been frequent targets for threats or attacks by previous Liberian governments or warring factions. We therefore call on your government to immediately cease all harassment of human rights groups and other organizations of civil society and to guarantee their ability to operate free of intimidation.   With regard to the Justice and Peace Commission, we urge you to ensure the protection and safety of all of its staff. Such steps constitute concrete ways for your government to underscore its commitment to internationally recognized human rights.   Thank you for your attention to these important matters.","Africa, Liberia","Free Speech"

Since his sacking on September 2, many of his supporters have also been arrested. The background to the case follows. Background By September 20, eleven persons associated with former Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had been arrested on unspecified charges, some apparently connected to allegations against Anwar of sexual misconduct, corruption and possible breaches of national security. Most were subsequently released, but some key associates of Anwar remain in detention under Malaysia's draconian Internal Security Act or ISA, a law which permits lengthy detention without charge or trial. Student supporters from the Mara Institute of Technology (IT) were also threatened with expulsion and blacklisting from government educational institutions for being involved in Anwar's campaigns for political reform. Civil servants were also warned not to participate in political movements or activities. Anwar Ibrahim was dismissed on September 2 when he refused to resign from his government positions after being accused of """"inappropriate behavior"""" following the publication of the book entitled 50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM (50 Reasons Why Anwar Cannot Become Prime Minister) in May. The book contains graphic sexual allegations as well as accusations of corruption against Anwar, who obtained a court injunction on June 17 to restrain the author, publisher, and their agents from publishing, distributing or reprinting the book. Anwar made a defamation complaint against the author, Khalid Jafri, and in August, police charged Jafri with malicious publishing of false news. In September, the judge who had banned further distribution of a book was transferred, leading to fears among Malaysian lawyers about possible threats to the independence of the judiciary. The book was circulated during the annual meeting of the UMNO party in June. It was during that meeting that Prime Minister Mahathir apparently began strengthening his control over the party, despite a public attack against cronyism and nepotism by an Anwar ally named Zahid Hamidi. Observers had speculated for months that Anwar's position was in jeopardy as forces close to the deputy prime minister appeared increasingly critical of Mahathir's style of governing and economic policies. In July, a visit by the Indonesian opposition leader Amien Rais led critics to compare events in Malaysia with those in Indonesia, where allegations of cronyism and economic and political dissatisfaction contributed to President Suharto's downfall. Domestic critics accused Mahathir of tolerating cronyism between corporate and government interests, and the international financial press and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) demanded greater transparency in government and UMNO-managed enterprises. The editors of both Utusan Malaysia,a Malay-language newspaper and magazine group, and of Berita Harian, another prominent Malay newspaper -- both Anwar-linked -- were allegedly forced to resign in July because of the prominence their papers had given to the transparency issue. Soon after his dismissal Anwar publicly accused Prime Minister Mahathir of """"paranoia"""" and resistance to political change. He said that he was fired because of his efforts to warn Mahathir of the public anger over corruption and cronyism in Malaysia and growing popular demands for reform. Disagreements between the two over economic policy had also become increasingly apparent over the past few months, with Anwar's dismissal coming one day after Mahathir announced plans to restrict foreign exchange transactions in order to prevent further currency devaluation. Anwar's dismissal extended to all his other positions held in his capacity as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, including Cabinet committee posts and the National Economic Action Council (NEAC) deputy chairmanship. On September 4 he was expelled from UMNO; where he served as the party's deputy president. Recent Arrests (September 21, 1998) Anwar was arrested from his home on the evening of September 20 by police armed with assault rifles and tear gas after some 35,000 supporters marched to Prime Minister Mahathir's house demanding his resignation. Also arrested following the demonstration were ruling United Malays National Organization (UMNO) youth chief Zahid Hamidi, Angkatan Belia Islam Malaysia (Abim) President Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, his deputy, Mukhtar Redhuan, Secretary-General Shaharuddin Badaruddin, Deputy National President Abdul Halim Ismail, and Roslan Kassim, an UMNO youth leader from a northern state who was in Anwar's house during a press conference. On September 21, police announced that the seven had been detained under the Internal Security Act for actions prejudicial to national security and were under investigation for their roles in Sunday's """"unrest, vandalism, illegal assembly and public disorder."""" On September 15 police threatened to arrest Anwar if he continued to address public meetings without a permit (as deputy prime minister he did not need one). A meeting on September 12 in northern Malaysia reportedly drew more than 40,000 people. Anwar Ibrahim's adopted brother, Sukma Darmawan, was arrested on September 6. Police reportedly confirmed his arrest, but the grounds on which he was detained were not made public at that time. Since then the press has contained allegations of his involvement in acts of sodomy with Anwar; sodomy is illegal under Malaysian law. Darmawan, a businessman, is also mentioned in the book, 50 Dalil Kenapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM. Similar charges have been made against Munawar Anees, a Pakistani national with permanent resident status in Malaysia and the US who was was detained under the ISA on September 14; Munawar was the editor of the now defunct Periodica Islamica, an English language quarterly which was published by Berita Publishing of the New Straits Times Group; he had reportedly written speeches for Anwar. A former Finance Ministry official was reportedly arrested later the same day, under Section 117 of the Penal Code which allows police to detain persons during investigations. On September 15, authorities detained Mohamed Azmin Ali, Anwar Ibrahim's former private secretary, also under section 117. Anwar has charged that authorities warned Mohamed's family members not to tell anyone of his arrest, not even his lawyers. Earlier, in August, police arrested a businessman friend of Anwar's, S. Nallakaruppan, under the ISA for unlawful possession of ammunition. Affidavits filed at the High Court by the Attorney General and an officer of the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) alleged that when police searched the home of S. Nallakaruppan in July while investigating the accusations made in the book, they found, besides the ammunition, sensitive letters and classified documents belonging to Anwar. The affidavits accused Nallakaruppan arranging some of Anwar's sexual liaisons and suggested that because he traveled abroad with Anwar, he may have been in the position to leak official secrets. Nallakaruppan has vehemently denied the charges and filed a complaint alleging harassment and mistreatment in police detention and requesting transfer to another facility. The Malaysian human rights organization, Suara Rakyat Malaysia (SUARAM), has called for the release of persons detained under the ISA. """"The entitlement to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial court is a basic right that belongs to everyone. The ISA is an explicit denunciation of that right,"""" a SUARAM statement read. Internal Security Act (ISA) (September 21, 1998) Malaysia's Internal Security Act provides for preventive detention for up to two years with the possibility of renewal every two years. Any police officer may, without a warrant, arrest and detain anyone he has """"reason to believe"""" has acted or likely to act in """"any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia."""" The act also allows for restrictions on freedom of assembly, association, and expression, freedom of movement, residence and employment. It allows for the closing of schools and educational institutions if they are used as a meeting place for an unlawful organization or for any other reason are deemed detrimental to the interests of Malaysia or the public. The right of ISA detainees to be fairly charged and tried is restricted not only by the provisions in the ISA for indefinitely renewable detention without trial, but also by a June 1989 amendment removing the jurisdiction of courts to hear habeas corpus petitions from ISA detainees. It was used to arrest political opponents of Mahathir in a major crackdown in 1987-88, as well as politicians in Sabah, east Malaysia, in 1990, whose party was considered a major rival to Umno. In November 1997 ten people were arrested under the ISA for allegedly spreading Shiite teachings deemed detrimental to national security; Muslims in Malaysia are Sunnis. In recent years, the law has also been used to arrest producers of false identity documents and work permits for foreign workers in Malaysia. Malaysia: Official Secrets Act (OSA) (September 21, 1998) Malaysia's Official Secrets Act is a broadly-worded law which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, as well as significant lesser penalties for the actions associated with the wrongful collection, possession or communication of official information. Any public officer can declare any material an official secret -- a certification which cannot be questioned in court . The act allows for arrest and detention without a warrant, and substantially reverses the burden of proof. It states that """"until the contrary is proven,"""" any of the activities proscribed under the act will be presumed to have been undertaken """"for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or interests of Malaysia."""" It is not necessary for the authorities to show that the accused person was guilty of a particular act, and states that even if no act is proved, the accused person may still be convicted on the basis of """"the circumstances of the case, his conduct or his known character..."""". Malaysia: Other Important Court Cases in Malaysia (September 21, 1998) The Malaysian government continues to use broad legislation and lengthy, expensive court proceedings to punish its critics and control free speech.  Lim Guan Eng On August 25, 1998 outspoken opposition parliamentarian Lim Guan Eng was jailed after he lost an appeal before the Federal Court. The Court upheld his sentence of two concurrent eighteen-month prison terms for sedition and malicious publishing of false news in connection with statements he made and published in 1995 accusing the Malaysia's Attorney General of mishandling allegations of statutory rape of a schoolgirl made against the Chief Minister of Malacca. Irene Fernandez Irene Fernandez, also accused of malicious publishing, has been on trial for more than two years. Fernandez, head of the Kuala Lumpur-based women's rights organization called Tenaganita or """"Women's Force,"""" faces the possibility of three years' imprisonment and substantial fines for publishing a short memorandum in July 1995 on abuses in immigration detention centers in Malaysia that the government claimed contained errors. The abuses cited included beatings, sexual assaults, extortion, inadequate food and water, unsanitary toilet facilities and poor medical care. Param Cumaraswamy Param Cumaraswamy, a Malaysian attorney who serves as United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, faces a $25 million defamation suit brought by two Malaysian companies for a 1997 interview with the London-based magazine International Commercial Litigation, in which he commented on his investigations into allegations of corporate interference with the Malaysian judiciary. The companies also requested a restraining order barring him from """"speaking or publishing or causing to be published . . . words defamatory of the plaintiffs."""" The Malaysian government refused to recognize the immunity granted him in his capacity as Special Rapporteur by the United Nations Secretary General. In August 1998 the case was referred to the International Court of Justice. Murray Hiebert Murray Hiebert, the Malaysia bureau chief of the Far Eastern Economic Review was found guilty of contempt of court and sentenced to three months in jail on September 4, 1997 for a story he wrote in January which published details of a civil suit brought by the wife of an Appeals Court Judge against the International School of Kuala Lumpur because it dropped her son from its debating team. Hiebert had written about the case in an article """"See You in Court"""" which commented on growing litigiousness in Malaysia. The article noted that the plaintiff was the wife of a judge and that the case appeared to move through the judicial system with unusual speed.","Asia, Malaysia","Free Speech"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/10/22/important-un-deadline-lapses-congo-and-rwanda","Important UN Deadline Lapses on Congo and Rwanda","Important U.N. Deadline Lapses on Congo and Rwanda","Human Rights Watch Urges Security Council to React","10/22/1998","(New York) - Human Rights Watch today deplored the failure of the governments of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to submit official reports on their progress in investigating the 1997 atrocities in Congo. The United Nations Security Council set a deadline of October 15 for Rwanda and Congo to submit progress reports on steps they had taken to investigate and prosecute massacres, atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law at the time the current Congo government took power in 1997.     In a letter to Amb. Jeremy Greenstock, president of the Security Council, Human Rights Watch today urged the council to press ahead with steps to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes and atrocities are brought to justice.     On June 30, the Secretary-General's Investigative Team (SGIT) released a report partially documenting the crimes in the Congo and calling for further investigations. At the time, Human Rights Watch criticized the decision to ask Rwanda and Congo, governments accused of massive human rights abuses, to investigate their own alleged crimes. Instead, Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council to consider creating an independent commission of inquiry for that purpose.     A copy of the letter is attached.     October 21, 1998     His Excellency Sir Jeremy Greenstock   President of the Security Council   United Nations Headquarters   New York, N.Y. 10017     Your Excellency,     In a Presidential Statement dated July 13 (S/PRST/1998/20), the Security Council requested the Governments of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Rwanda to provide by October 15 an initial progress report on the steps being taken by them to investigate and prosecute those responsible for massacres, atrocities and violations of international humanitarian law that took place in the Congo, and especially in its eastern provinces. These crimes were partially documented by the Secretary-General's Investigative Team (SGIT) in its June 30 report to the Security Council. In particular, the SGIT's report implicated President Kabila's forces and their allies of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) in the wide scale massacres of Hutu refugees which took place in the former Zaire during their 1996/97 military campaign for power.     To our knowledge, this deadline has not been met and no reports were submitted by either government. Human Rights Watch is deeply disappointed that the Security Council has yet to react to their failure to meet the deadline the Council itself has put forward. Furthermore, as we stated in our July 14 letter to the Security Council, we consider the course of action the Council adopted in its July 13 statement too weak because it stopped short of authorizing an independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible for these crimes, as the SGIT had recommended.     Because the 1996/97 killings remain unaccounted for, the climate of impunity that for so long has permeated the Great Lakes Region has only been strengthened. Impunity for all these crimes has, in turn, fed into the devastating civil war currently gripping Congo which is fast spreading to the region and the continent.     The international community should hold all the protagonists responsible for the alarming disregard of the basic humanitarian and human rights principles that fighters on both sides have displayed. All parties have resorted to arbitrary detention and extrajudicial executions of their perceived ethnic adversaries. The use of hate propaganda directed at Tutsis in government-run radio and television is a matter of grave concern given the proven efficiency of that ploy in paving the way for mass killings. The conflict has forced the flight of thousands of civilians from their homes in rebel-controlled eastern Congo, while in Kinshasa and other cities hundreds of ethnic Tutsi have been rounded up, detained, executed, or forced to flee for their lives. Both parties to the conflict recruit child soldiers and send them to the front.     The governments of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo who are now at odds remain as unlikely as before to assume full responsibility for past and current massacres. Following the deterioration of his government's relations with Rwanda, Congo's Foreign Minister Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, in an address to the U.N. General Assembly on September 24, said current rebel crimes against innocent civilians """"remind us of the killing perpetrated against Hutu refuced in a joint communiqué on October 7 """"state-inspired genocide"""" against the DRC's Tutsi minority, and accused President Kabilagees by the elements of the same Rwandan Patriotic Army."""" This official admission echoed an earlier statement by Minister of State Victor Mpoyo who charged in addition that the RPA was solely responsible for his government's systematic obstruction of the United Nation's probe into the refugee killings. Rwanda and Uganda, for their part, denoun of supporting Rwandan Hutu extremists. Although the Congolese and Rwandan governments should be encouraged to come forward with whatever information they have on this matter, the task of fully verifying such information should be assigned to independent investigators so that the search for facts may not be subordinated to political considerations.   The punishment of the perpetrators of past as well as current atrocities and crimes against humanity committed in the Congo remains a matter of utmost urgency if the cycle of mass killings is ever to be interrupted. Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the Security Council to:    press ahead with steps to ensure that the perpetrators of the 1996/97 crimes and atrocities are brought to justice, in line with the July 13 statement, taking measures to:   o endow an appropriate judicial body, possibly the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, with the authority to investigate the massacres and to determine individual responsibility for them;   o alternatively, consider creating an independent commission of inquiry with the resources to establish individual and command responsibilities for the massacres, and with the mandate to report its findings publicly and by a specified date.    In the context of the current war in the Congo and the efforts by the international community to put an end to the conflict, Human Rights Watch urges the Security Council to press all parties to the conflict to:    observe the prohibition of incitement to violence, discrimination, crimes against humanity, and genocide under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Geneva Conventions, and the Genocide Convention;  observe the right of civilians to humanitarian protection and therefore guarantee their access to humanitarian assistance, in particular from the ICRC and other international agencies;  allow the deployment, by or in close collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), of human rights monitors throughout the country. The monitoring of hate media / propaganda, particularly in local languages, should be a priority.   Any attempt to achieve a ceasefire without at the same time addressing the need to stop the cycle of violence and abuse, will be a temporary measure at best and will not provide a meaningful and lasting solution.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda","International Justice, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/10/22/letter-president-clinton-urging-us-involvement-pinochet-case","Letter to President Clinton Urging US Involvement in Pinochet Case","Letter to President Clinton Urging U.S. Involvement in Pinochet Case","","10/22/1998","President William Jefferson Clinton  The White House  Washington, DC 20500   Dear President Clinton:   Human Rights Watch urges the United States to help promote judicial accountability for the crimes committed during the military rule of Augusto Pinochet. We look to the United States to indicate clearly and publicly to the governments of Spain and the United Kingdom that it supports efforts to achieve justice for crimes against humanity committed under the direction of General Pinochet. As a concrete measure of that support, the U.S. can and must cooperate fully with Spanish authorities investigating the case by providing all evidence in its possession of these crimes.   The systematic human rights violations committed by the Chilean military during the Pinochet dictatorship amount to crimes against humanity.  Official Chilean investigations have confirmed that more than 3,100 people were victims of extrajudicial execution or """"disappearance."""" Thousands of others were victims of torture, arbitrary detention, forced internal exile, or other abuses.   International law-as well the prevention of future atrocities-demands the prosecution of those responsible for these abuses. The Chilean military granted itself an amnesty in 1978, however, and the Chilean justice system has investigated and prosecuted only the rarest of cases.   Self-conferred impunity should hold no sway internationally.  Future tyrants must understand that punishment awaits those who commit crimes against humanity, internationally if not domestically.  The United States should therefore encourage and support efforts to prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity.   The United States also has a more immediate interest in a full investigation of General Pinochet's crimes. According to Chile's official National Truth and Reconciliation Commission, at least three U.S. citizens were murdered in Chile after the 1973 coup.  These include Charles Edmund Horman and Frank Randal Teruggi, who were executed by the military in September 1973.  In addition, in September 1976, a terrorist car-bombing killed former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and U.S. citizen Ronni Karpen Moffitt in Washington, DC.  A U.S. grand jury indicted four members of Pinochet's security police, the DINA, including the agency's chief of operations Army Brig. Pedro Espinoza and its director Army Gen. Manuel Contreras Seplveda, a man who reported directly to General Pinochet.  In 1995, both Contreras and Espinoza went to prison in Chile for the crime.   The undertaking by Spanish judges Baltazar Garzón and Manuel García-Castellón to bring General Pinochet to justice is based on well-established international law and practice giving Spain the right to assert jurisdiction over crimes against Spanish nationals in Chile.  In addition, as those who commit crimes against humanity are considered enemies of all mankind, their crimes, even against non-Spaniards, can also be tried by Spanish courts.   Nonetheless, public statements by U.S. officials since Pinochet's detention by law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom have been disappointingly restrained, referring only to the need to avoid commenting on the judicial process and suggesting that the matter is strictly between Spain, the United Kingdom, and Chile.  This is not a question of interference in judicial independence, however.  Any Spanish judicial decision to seek extradition would have to be approved by the Spanish government, and the Spanish government should know where the U.S. stands.  The lack of public U.S. support for the investigation-particularly given the U.S.'s direct interest in the case-sends the signal that the United States is indifferent to bringing General Pinochet to trial.   The U.S.'s muted position on the need to bring Pinochet to justice contrasts with its active attempts earlier this year to seek to bring Pol Pot to trial in Canada.  That effort would have required Canada to use a pure theory of universal jurisdiction-without Canada having any particular nexus to the crimes in question-while the Spanish investigation is currently proceeding on the basis of the murder, torture, and """"disappearances"""" of Spanish citizens, a more traditional jurisdictional theory.  The U.S. should be at least as supportive of Spain's assertion of jurisdiction over Pinochet as it was of attempts to try Pol Pot in Canada.   A concrete measure of U.S. support would be to provide all the information the U.S. has collected relating to General Pinochet's role in crimes against humanity, including the extensive evidence it amassed in the investigation of the Letelier-Moffitt murders.  We are concerned, however, by reports that the U.S. has been stingy in its cooperation with requests made by Spanish law enforcement authorities acting under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the U.S. and Spain.  A public statement by the U.S. on the importance of accountability would also serve to dispel the impression that the U.S. does not favor the investigation going forward.   We know that, just as the Chilean judiciary has been unable to prosecute General Pinochet, the government of Chile now opposes the Spanish extradition request.  But while domestic legal and political considerations in Chile may give the country's leaders grounds to explain their actions, international law recognizes no such excuses. The same is true of the Chilean government's claim of diplomatic immunity, since Pinochet was not on diplomatic mission or in an official delegation temporarily conferring diplomatic status.  In any event, diplomatic immunity should not be a shield for those accused of committing crimes against humanity.  Similarly, we believe that short-term concerns that the prosecution of crimes against humanity will jeopardize transitions by causing tyrants to cling to power are outweighed by the international community's long-term interest in making it clear to future tyrants that they face punishment if they embark on crimes against humanity.   Mr. President, Human Rights Watch, together with many governments and victims of abuse, viewed the United States' positions during this summer's diplomatic conference in Rome to establish an International Criminal Court as a retreat from traditional U.S. support for the prosecution of crimes against humanity.  U.S. leaders responded that it was not.  Particularly since this case involves a responsible democracy pursuing crimes committed against its own citizens, the Pinochet investigation is an opportunity to resurrect the United States' image as a proponent of accountability for the worst international crimes.  Sincerely,  Kenneth Roth  Executive Director   cc:     Secretary of State Madeleine Albright","Americas, United States, Chile, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

In a letter to President Bill Clinton, Human Rights Watch Executive Director Kenneth Roth called on the U.S. government to transfer to Spanish judges all evidence it has collected on Pinochet's crimes. Spanish authorities have requested that the United States share, among other evidence, the results of its investigation into the involvement of Chilean security forces in the assassination of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C. Press reports suggest that the American government has not complied fully with Spain's request. An American citizen, Ronni Moffitt, was also killed when a bomb exploded under Letelier's car on September 21, 1976. At least two other Americans were executed by government agents after the 1973 coup that brought Pinochet to power, according to a 1991 report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation.  """"The U.S. government can't sit on the sidelines in this case,"""" said Roth. """"Pinochet is wanted for crimes against American citizens, and even crimes on American soil. Washington needs to speak out in favor of prosecuting this tyrant."""" Since Pinochet's arrest on October 16 in London, the U.S. government has declined to speak publicly about the case, calling such comment """"inappropriate."""" Roth urged Clinton to contact the British and Spanish authorities to help accelerate the handover of Pinochet. Fears of disrupting relations with Chile, which has opposed the extradition, should not guide U.S. policy in this important international legal matter, Roth said. Roth noted that the U.S. took a strong stand earlier this year in recommending that the Cambodian dictator Pol Pot be handed over to courts in the West, possibly Canada. But the jurisdictional basis for Spain to proceed against Pinochet, whose regime executed Spanish citizens, is potentially much stronger than the case against Pol Pot, who did not kill any Canadians, Roth added. Human Rights Watch's letter also suggested that by cooperating in the Pinochet case, the United States could help to repair the damage done to its image as a human rights leader at the negotiations for an international criminal court this summer in Rome. The United States was one of only seven nations that voted against the treaty to establish the court, which will investigate and prosecute future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. One hundred and twenty nations voted for the treaty. """"One day, we hope, an international criminal court will help deter tyrants like Pinochet from committing their crimes in the first place,"""" said Roth. """"Until that day comes, the U.S. needs to throw its public support behind this extradition. Washington has to get back on the right side of issues of international justice.""""","Americas, United States, Chile, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

In seven states, a staggering one in four black men is permanently disenfranchised. In two states, Alabama and Florida, the ratio is one in three If current trends continue, in a dozen states as many as 30-40% of the next generation of black men will permanently lose the right to vote. Almost every state in the U.S. denies prisoners the right to vote. But fourteen states bar criminal offenders from voting even after they have finished their sentences. In these states, over one million ex-offenders are permanently disenfranchised.  Any felony can trigger disenfranchisement. A first-time young offender who pleads guilty to a single drug sale and is placed on probation can lose the right to vote for a lifetime. """"These people have paid their debt to society. It makes no sense to turn them into political outcasts,"""" said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel at the New York-based Human Rights Watch and co-author of the report. """"No other country in the world takes away the right to vote for life."""" """"Fifty years after the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement, it is tragic that every day more black citizens lose their voting rights,"""" said Marc Mauer, report co-author and assistant director of The Sentencing Project, based in Washington. """"This is not just a criminal justice issue, but one of basic democracy."""" Nationwide, a total of 1.4 million black men—thirteen percent of all black men—cannot vote either because they are permanently disenfranchised ex-offenders, or because they are convicted felons currently in prison, on probation or on parole. The number of disenfranchised adults of all races is 3.9 million, three-quarters of whom are not in prison but are on probation or parole or have completed their sentences. The report, Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement Laws in the United States, is the first-ever state-by-state analysis of the impact of felony disenfranchisement laws.  The rate of disenfranchisement has grown higher in recent years as a result of harsh drug laws and mandatory sentencing requirements, which have sharply increased the number of offenders behind bars.  Disenfranchised ex-offenders can seek a gubernatorial pardon to restore their voting rights, but few have the information or resources needed to do so. In Virginia, for example, there are more than 200,000 ex-offenders, but in 1996 and 1997, only 404 regained their voting rights.  Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project call for an end to permanent disenfranchisement. They also urge Congress and state legislatures to ensure citizens convicted of a felony retain their ability to vote unless disenfranchisement is part of a court-imposed sentence for specified serious crimes. In addition, the two organizations urge the United Nations Human Rights Committee to address U.S. criminal disenfranchisement laws in light of international human rights treaties prohibiting unreasonable or racially discriminatory restrictions on the right to vote.

The Argentine Center for Legal and Social Studies (Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, CELS) and Human Rights Watch, the largest U.S.-based human rights organization, describe widespread police brutality, torture of suspected criminals, corruption among high-level police officials, legislation that violates basic rights, and insufficient control by judicial and civilian authorities over police forces. The report is the first of its kind to focus exclusively on police abuse in Argentina. In light of the disturbing findings of the 250-page report, the groups expressed concern over recent statements by Argentine President Carlos Saْl Menem that a """"hard line"""" must be taken to combat crime, and that """"some human rights organizations can protest, but I think that criminals have more protection here than the police or the people."""" Escalating levels of crime have diminished public safety and have led to a generalized feeling of insecurity among the Argentine population. """"Given the police force's history of brutal behavior, the president's call for more aggressive policing is troubling, indeed,"""" said Martيn Abregْ, executive director of CELS. """"His statements are counterproductive at a time when it is critical for police forces to hold their agents accountable for abuses. Currently too many police agents, instead of fighting crime and apprehending criminals, have become criminals themselves, contributing to the climate of fear in many cities."""" José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, noted that both federal and provincial police forces must initiate widespread reforms to ensure respect for international human rights standards. """"Police forces must be professionalized and be subject to independent, external control to curb police brutality in Argentina,"""" said Vivanco. """"Reform at all levels—national, regional, and local—is necessary both to comply with international standards and to make police forces more efficient and productive,"""" added Vivanco. The joint report by CELS and Human Rights Watch, """"Exacerbating Insecurity: Police Brutality in Argentina"""" is the result of more than two years of investigation throughout Argentina. Some of the abuses documented in the report include: """"Disappearances"""" in police custody; Killings by police in alleged """"shoot-outs,"""" in which investigations often demonstrated that the police shot the victims point-blank and then fabricated evidence of a shoot-out (such as the planting of a gun on the victim's body); The killing of innocent bystanders during armed confrontations between the police and criminal suspects; Deaths in police custody, frequently after torture to force confessions, later often described as suicide; """"Easy trigger"""" cases in which police officers shot to kill rather than seeking to detain suspects (sometimes due to minor provocations); Excessive use of force in controlling demonstrations, such as an August 13, 1998 incident in which the provincial police in Jujuy province used batons, tear gas, and rubber bullets against public employees demanding payment of back salaries, leaving thirty wounded; Harassment of or attacks on witnesses to these crimes. The report describes structural problems that range from the practice of requiring off-duty agents to carry firearms to legislation that permits, or even endorses, abusive behavior. For example, police agents have the authority to detain an individual for unconventional reasons, including for verification of identity and for suspected criminal background, a practice that severely threatens the basic rights of individuals. CELS and Human Rights Watch note that individuals detained for these superfluous reasons are the most frequent victims of torture or death while in police custody. One of the most serious impediments to accountability documented in the report is the frequent cover-up of crimes by security forces. Official version of events given by police forces often make it impossible to present contrary evidence to the courts. Furthermore, judicial authorities often do not fully investigate crimes committed by security agents. Because of the widespread impunity currently enjoyed by abusive and corrupt members of police forces, any reform to address these problems must ensure the prosecution and punishment of past crimes and the enactment of a legal framework that adequately sanctions grave violations of human rights. The report recommends a number of concrete measures to professionalize the police force and curtail abuses by police agents, including criminal and administrative prosecution of police officers involved in human rights violations, the protection of witnesses testifying against police agents, and the elimination of police agents' obligation to carry firearms even when off duty.","Americas, Argentina",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/10/20/recommendations-osce-kosovo-verification-mission","Recommendations on the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission","Recommendations on the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission","","10/20/1998","Pre-deployment Benchmarks The Mandate of the Verification Mission Conclusion In light of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's (FRY) poor record of cooperation with the international community, Human Rights Watch is concerned that the OSCE Kosovo Verification Mission, established to monitor compliance with Security Council Resolutions 1160 and 1199, may face serious incidents of non-compliance and obstruction of its work. It is critically important therefore, that the international community establish clear benchmarks toward which substantial progress must be made before the OSCE mission is deployed--expending OSCE political capital and putting a substantial number of unarmed civilian personnel at risk. It is also essential that once deployed, the mission has a strong, pro-active human rights orientation. This briefing paper details Human Rights Watch's specific recommendations regarding necessary pre-deployment compliance and the human rights activities of the mission.   Pre-deployment Benchmarks: The recent history of peace-making in the Balkans has been a story of broken promises. Since the conflict in Kosovo broke out last February, the government of Slobodan Milosevic has repeatedly promised compliance with international demands, only promptly to renege and renew its abusive campaign against the Kosovo Albanians. The current failure of Milosevic to make promised troop withdrawals--causing NATO to extend its deadline for compliance from October 17 to October 27--is a worrisome sign that the pattern may continue. Equally troubling is evidence that the KLA has broken its ceasefire. By pursuing their mandate aggressively and publicly, the proposed OSCE monitors may help create an environment in which civilians feel less at risk. But as unarmed civilians, with their authority ultimately limited to verification, the OSCE personnel may be powerless to stop abuses and may even become targets themselves. Before the OSCE puts its imprimatur on the peace process and its personnel at risk, it must insist on several key indicators of FRY's good faith implementation of its commitments. The existing Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) is well placed to provide this interim verification. Human Rights Watch believes that, at a minimum, the OSCE should receive clear indication of substantial progress toward fulfillment of the following important benchmarks prior to the deployment:            Withdrawal of all Serbian special police forces and any paramilitary units that have or are suspected of having perpetrated human rights or humanitarian law violations in Kosovo; and disclosure of information regarding the command structure for all remaining forces, including the identities and locations of all commanding officers. Guaranteed safe passage and unincumbered access for humanitarian aid delivery and distribution to displaced persons throughout Kosovo.    Full cooperation with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in her investigation into alleged atrocities committed in Kosovo, including the provision of unrestricted access to the territory and full investigatory rights.       Disclosure of all current places of detention where persons detained in connection with the conflict are being held; disclosure of the names of all individuals detained during the course of the conflict and their current whereabouts; and provision of full and unfettered access for humanitarian organizations to all detainees, including those who are currently being investigated but have not been charged with a crime.  Only upon compliance with these minimum requirements for a lasting peace can the OSCE verification mission hope to be successfully deployed. The Mandate of the Verification Mission: Human Rights Watch believes that the OSCE mission must maintain a strong human rights orientation for its work. The U.N.'s conclusions in a recent non-paper on lessons learned from the UNTAES mission to Croatia are instructive:                      In Eastern Slavonia, the establishment of a safe and secure environment was essential to the return of refugees and displaced persons. The monitoring of human rights was closely associated with the return of refugees and displaced persons. As the level of respect for human rights rose, so did the rate of return of refugees and displaced persons. The constant presence of CIVPOL in all police stations provided an essential reassurance to local residents that their basic human rights would be protected during criminal investigations and when in police custody. OSCE and ECMM together with CIVPOL worked closely in monitoring human rights, thereby demonstrating the consensus in the international community on the importance of respect for human rights. It was essential for the future of the region to improve the professionalism and knowledge of the region's TPF in the field of human rights by providing on-site training, special courses on identification of, investigation and reporting on, human rights violations.(1)  Similarly, in Kosovo, the humanitarian crisis that has driven recent peacemaking efforts can only be solved if the Verification Mission effectively addresses the human rights violations that caused the crisis in the first place. To do so, the mission must be authorized and obliged to investigate and monitor ongoing human rights and humanitarian law violations, collect information on past abuses, cooperate with international organizations, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, and regularly publicize its activities and findings. These activities have been implicitly agreed in the October 16 agreement between the Yugoslav authorities and the OSCE, as they are essential to fulfillment of the Mission's mandate to, inter alia, facilitate the return of displaced persons, monitor the conduct of the police, and facilitate ICRC access to detainees. Drawing from our experience in other peace-keeping and -implementing missions throughout the world, Human Rights Watch believes that the human rights responsibilities of the mission should be coordinated by a specialized unit, well-staffed by persons with the necessary expertise and operating under the direct supervision of the head of mission. All members of the OSCE mission should receive training in human rights monitoring and the mission should include staff with field experience in monitoring human rights abuses and interviewing victims and witnesses of atrocities, including torture, rape, and sexual abuse; forensic experts; legal experts knowledgeable in international human rights and humanitarian law; specialists in police and military methodology; and those knowledgeable in building civil society and democratic institutions. The Mission's periodic reports to the Security Council and Permanent Council should contain a specific section devoted to human rights-related developments, and these findings and recommendations should be publicly available. The human rights mandate of the mission should be clearly set forth in a mission statement of the OSCE prior to the deployment of its monitors. Specifically, the human rights mandate of the OSCE mission should empower and oblige the mission to: Freely monitor and investigate human rights conditions:  Receive complaints of human rights abuses from any person or group in Kosovo.  Travel freely and visit any site, including any suspected or known places of detention.  Interview persons freely and in private, including detainees who have not yet been charged with a crime.  Monitor, report, and publicize abuses committed by the security forces:  Monitor the behavior of the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army and investigate incidents of harassment or violence against the population; raise cases of abuse with the appropriate authorities; recommend corrective action, including dismissal or prosecution; and publicize the abuses, particularly in cases where the authorities fail to take appropriate corrective action.  Monitor, report, and publicize KLA abuses:  Monitor and investigate any harassment or abuse by the Kosovo Liberation Army against ethnic Albanians, Serbs, and others; report those abuses to the KLA and the Yugoslav authorities; recommend accountability or other corrective action in conformity with international standards; and publicize the abuses, particularly where the KLA or Yugoslav authorities fail to take appropriate corrective action.  Monitor, report, and publicize conditions of detention:  In cooperation with ICRC, monitor the treatment of those in detention through regular visits to prisons and police stations and suspected places of detention, including those located outside of Kosovo but holding persons detained in connection with the conflict; interview detainees, freely and in private, including those who have not yet been charged with a crime; raise objections with the authorities when access to detention facilities is denied or conditions deviate from international standards; recommend corrective action, including dismissal or prosecution; and publicize those conditions when the authorities fail to take corrective action, including the prosecution of responsible officials.  Monitor, report, and publicize conduct of trials:  Observe trials, especially those of ethnic Albanians accused of """"terrorism"""" or other crimes related to state security; raise objections with the authorities when access to trials is denied and when procedural irregularities are identified; recommend remedial measures; and publicize procedural violations, particularly when the authorities fail to take remedial action.  Monitor, report, and publicize conditions for return of displaced persons:  Monitor and investigate obstacles to the right of return for the estimated 250,000 internally displaced persons in Kosovo; bring those obstacles to the attention of the authorities; recommend remedial measures; and publicize the problem, particularly when the authorities fail to remedy it.  Monitor, report, and publicize restrictions on the media:  Monitor and investigate restrictions on freedom of the press in Serbia, both on the Albanian- and Serbian-language media; publicize deficiencies in freedom of expression and recommend needed reform to the authorities.  Work with local and international human rights organizations:  Maintain close contact with local and international human rights organizations working in Kosovo and develop procedures for regular consultation and information sharing.  Cooperate with the ICTY:  Cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia by identifying possible witnesses and evidence of violations of international humanitarian law. To facilitate this cooperation, Mission members should be briefed on the specific evidentiary needs of the ICTY and instructed to forward relevant information.  Contribute to human rights institution building:  Lead or participate in efforts to assist in the development of national institutions--both governmental and nongovernmental--which can protect and promote human rights after the international monitoring has ended.  Vet the police force for human right abusers:  As part of police force development envisioned by the agreement, ensure that all police officers responsible for war crimes or other serious human rights violations are not allowed to serve in any capacity in law enforcement. For purposes of the vetting of police officers, the OSCE should seek information regarding individual police officers' human rights record from the ICTY, local and international human rights groups, the public, as well as from the OSCE's own human rights monitors.  In conclusion, Human Rights Watch notes that the OSCE should not limit its engagement in FRY to the verification mission. First, the new OSCE mission to Kosovo should not be considered a replacement for the long-term, Yugoslav-wide OSCE mission that was expelled from the country in 1992. Such a mission to monitor human rights conditions throughout Yugoslavia is essential to any viable long-term political solution in FRY and should remain a central demand of the international community. Second, recognizing limitations on his mandate, Human Rights Watch believes that the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities might play an important role in Kosovo, providing an early warning mechanism for possible renewed violence stemming from abuses committed against Albanians, Serbs or other minorities resident in the region. Finally, the OSCE should support recent efforts of its Representative on Freedom of the Media to address the serious violations of free expression that undermine prospects for any lasting political solution in FRY. 1.

Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance, from October 19-28, but said the visit itself was not an indication of greater religious freedom. We will be following very closely how the Vietnamese government reacts to the Special Rapporteur's findings,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"After a similar visit to China in 1994, Mr. Amor made a number of extremely useful recommendations to the Chinese government on how to further freedom of religion, not one of which was adopted. We hope that this government will be more responsive."""" Jones said official visits should not replace action by the Vietnamese government to change abusive policies and practices restricting religious freedoms. In previous reports on other countries, Mr. Amor has looked at treatment of religious minorities, imprisonment of religious activists, restrictions on religious education and distribution of religious materials, and state controls on religious organizations. If his visit follows the pattern of previous missions, Mr. Amor will produce a report by early 1999 and present it to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights before the commission's annual meetings begin in mid-March. The visit by the Special Rapporteur comes just after the release in September of at least eleven prominent dissidents and religious leaders in Vietnam, part of a broader amnesty involving more than 5,000 prisoners. Religious leaders who were released included prominent monks Thich Quang Do, Thich Tri Sieu, and Thich Tue Sy, all members of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), as well as Paul Nguyen Chau Dat and Tadeo Dinh Viet Hieu, members of the Catholic Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix. It is not clear what prompted the amnesties, but the Special Rapporteur's planned visit may have been a factor. The Vietnamese government has not made public the full list of released prisoners, leading to some confusion as to who is still detained. Nevertheless, dozens of church leaders are known to remain in prison, under house arrest, surveillance, or in """"administrative detainment"""" under Directive 31/CP, which authorizes detention without trial for up to two years by the Ministry of Interior.  Other violations of freedom of religion include the requirement that all religious activity be approved by the state, and restrictions on travel by religious leaders and the contents of their sermons and speeches.  In July 1998, the Politburo issued its first directive on religion, stating that the party's policy is to respect religious freedom, but to ban """"superstitious practices."""" The directive does not, however, define """"superstitious practices."""" It also prohibits the printing and distribution of Bibles, bans """"excessive mobilization of the population,"""" and threatens legal repercussions against those who abuse religion to cause social unrest or oppose the government.  The government turned down a request for a papal visit in August during the 200th anniversary of the sanctuary of the Notre Dame of La Vang in Quang Tri province. It also attempted to discourage citizens from other provinces from traveling to La Vang for this event. (Nevertheless, more than 60,000 Catholic pilgrims were able to attend, making it the largest religious gathering in Vietnam in decades.)  On the other hand, the government in March approved the Vatican's appointment of a new archbishop of Ho Chi Minh City, a position that had been left vacant for five years because of official rejection of an earlier nominee. While information is too scarce to provide a definitive list of all religious dissidents currently in detention or under house arrest in Vietnam, they are believed to include the following: Thich Huyen Quang, eighty-one, currently under house arrest in Nghia Hanh district in Quang Ngai province, is the Supreme Patriarch of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), which is not recognized by the Communist Party. He has was first arrested in April 1977, then again in 1982 for protesting against the state-sponsored Vietnam Buddhist Church. From his forced exile in central Quang Ngai province, he issued a declaration in November 1993 calling for democratic reform and respect for human rights. In December 1994 he was rearrested on charges of organizing a UBCV flood relief operation in the Mekong Delta.  Thich Khong Tanh (Phan Ngoc An), formerly the head monk at the Lien Tri pagoda in Thu Duc, was detained on November 6, 1994 for his role as chairman of a UBCV flood relief effort. He was previously arrested by Ho Chi Minh City security police on October 2, 1992 for leaving his pagoda without a permit to travel the fifteen kilometers into the city. He was charged with """"undermining the policy of unity"""" and """"circulating anti-socialist propaganda"""" after police searched his room at the Lien Tri pagoda and confiscated letters by Thich Huyen Quang. Thich Khong Tanh had reportedly also been arrested in 1976 and imprisoned for ten years for writing a letter to the Prime Minister protesting the government's abolishment of a long-standing policy which exempted Buddhist monks from military conscription. He is currently detained in camp Z30A, Xuan Loc, Dong Nai province.  Thich Nhat Ban, arrested with Thich Khong Tanh on November 6, 1994 for his involvement in a UBCV planned flood relief effort, is currently detained in camp Z30A, Xuan Loc, Dong Nai province. Thich Thien Minh is currently detained in camp Z30A, Xuan Loc, Dong Nai province. Several leaders and lay followers of the Catholic Congregation of the Mother Co-Redemptrix, arrested in 1987, are currently believed to remain in prison, including Father John Bosco Pham Minh Chi, Brother Benedito Nguyen Viet Huan (Nguyen Thien Phung), Brother John Euder Mai Duc Chuong, and Brother Michael Nguyen Van Thin.

Augusto Pinochet, military dictator of Chile between 1973 and 1990. Given the seriousness of the crimes committed by the Chilean military during those years, and the impunity enjoyed by the authorities responsible for the abuses, we fully support the Spanish legal action against General Pinochet. At the same time, we respectfully urge the British government to take all necessary remaining steps to facilitate the Spanish inquiry into the widespread and systematic human rights violations committed under General Pinochet's command.   The human rights violations committed by the military during the dictatorship must unequivocally be termed crimes against humanity. Chile's official National Truth and Reconciliation Commission confirmed that the Chilean military, acting under authority of General Pinochet, extrajudicially executed 1,068 people and """"disappeared"""" another 957; soldiers systematically tortured detainees. The total number of people executed or disappeared by Chile's military government is likely to be much higher, given that the commission's figures correspond to the cases that could, on the basis of existing evidence, be definitively linked to authorities. Only an exhaustive judicial investigation could ascertain the full extent of the crimes against humanity committed during the seventeen years of military rule in Chile. Indeed, international law demands no less than the prosecution of those responsible for these abuses. Unfortunately, due in large part to an amnesty that the military granted itself in 1978, the Chilean justice system has failed to investigate or prosecute all but the rarest of cases.   Human Rights Watch strongly supports the Spanish effort to bring Chilean human rights violators to justice. Based on well-established international law and practice, the Spanish have the right to assert jurisdiction over cases in which Spanish nationals were victimized in Chile. However, given the nature of the crimes committed by the Chilean military-that they constitute crimes against humanity-cases of non-Spanish nationals can also be tried by Spanish courts. Since the Nuremberg trials, the principle of """"universal jurisdiction"""" for crimes against humanity has been firmly established. This concept rests on the notion that all states have an interest in seeing that justice is done in such cases and possess authority to exercise jurisdiction, irrespective of any other link between the court and the alleged crime.   Human Rights Watch disagrees fundamentally with the Chilean government's claim that General Pinochet should benefit from diplomatic immunity because he traveled to London with a diplomatic passport. The general was not on diplomatic mission and was not participating in an official delegation in which diplomatic status would have been temporarily conferred. Indeed, the preamble to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which Chile is a party, clearly places the purpose of the convention within the context of work-related diplomatic activity, not personal business."""" It states, """"[T]he purpose of such privileges and immunities is not to benefit individuals but to ensure the efficient performance of the functions of diplomatic missions as representing States."""" We understand that, as a courtesy, the Chilean government regularly provides diplomatic passports to members of the country's congress who travel abroad on official or personal business. In cases of personal travel with a diplomatic passport, however, the travel document may facilitate immigration and customs procedures but cannot be considered to change the diplomatic status of a non-diplomat.   Human Rights Watch applauds the British government's support of the Spanish court's inquiry into human rights violations committed by the military in Chile. The international community must stand ready to ensure that self-conferred impunity for human rights violations, however effective within national borders, does not hold sway internationally. Spain and the U.K. have given important practical effect to a longstanding principle-the perpetrator of crimes against humanity is like the pirate of olden days: he can be tried wherever he is found. We respectfully urge that British authorities take all necessary steps to continue in this regard.

As a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as well as its Optional Protocol which provides for individual communications, the government of Sierra Leone is obliged to guarantee the right to review by a higher court. """"The Sierra Leonean government has repeatedly said it is committed to international human rights standards,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"These cases will be an important test for them."""" Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all cases, particularly in light of Sierra Leone's fledgling judicial system and the irreversible nature of a death sentence. The New York-based rights group further called on the Sierra Leonean government to restructure the military court system to include an appeal process.","Africa, Sierra Leone","United Nations"

Ahmad Tejan Kabbah President of the Republic of Sierra Leone Freetown, Sierra Leone   Your Excellency,   Human Rights Watch welcomes your efforts and those of your government to promote the rule of law, accountability, and respect for human rights in Sierra Leone. The May 25, 1997 coup and subsequent military rule shattered the country's infrastructure, notably that of the judicial system. With limited economic resources and amidst continued fighting and atrocities in rural areas, the Sierra Leonean government has made important progress towards upholding its obligations under national law and international human rights standards while promoting reconciliation. We similarly appreciate the efforts of your government to make public the judicial proceedings of the recent treason trials and to respect due process.   This past Monday, a Court Martial in Freetown passed death sentences for thirty-four soldiers accused of treason and other offenses. Later that day, the Minister of Information declared that in respect to the trials, """"at the end of the day the proceedings will be adjudged acceptable by both local and international standards."""" He further stated that the Sierra Leonean government would responsibly """"act within the law of Sierra Leone and the terms of the relevant International Conventions to which this country is a signatory.""""   The lack of a right to appeal to a higher court for the thirty-four - who now face execution by firing squad-is in sharp contrast to this and other statements by your government calling for respect for international human rights norms. As a State Party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as well as its Optional Protocol which provides for individual communications, the government of Sierra Leone is obliged to guarantee the right to review by a higher court.   In light of the lack of a right to appeal, several of those sentenced to death have submitted petitions to the United Nations Human Rights Committee as provided for by the Optional Protocol, to which Sierra Leone has been a State Party since August 1996. More petitions from those sentenced are likely to follow. We call on your government to adhere to its obligations as a Party to the Optional Protocol and allow the petition process to run its due course. To do so would send a clear and positive message to the Sierra Leonean people as well as the international community emphasizing your government's will to make human rights a priority while holding perpetrators accountable under due process of national and international law. We would additionally urge your government, as a Party to the ICCPR, to in a timely fashion make structural changes in the military court system to ensure the right to appeal.   We also draw your attention to the inherent fallibility of all criminal justice systems - even those with long histories of respect for due process - and the fact that innocent persons are sometimes executed, even when the law is respected. Sierra Leone's fledgling justice system - which members of your own government have described as totally demolished during the coup - provides all the more reason for avoiding the use of the death penalty. Executions are irreversible, and such miscarriages of justice can never be corrected. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch objects to capital punishment in all countries and in all circumstances due to its inherent cruelty.   During this particularly difficult and formative period in Sierra Leonean history, we would encourage the government of Sierra Leone to maintain national reconciliation as a priority while dispensing justice and holding perpetrators fully accountable for human rights abuses. With this in mind, if the death penalty is upheld, action from the Prerogative of Mercy Committee in accordance with Sierra Leonean law would be appropriate. In this case, as head of the Committee, we appeal to your Excellency to commute the death sentences. We would further urge the Committee to closely follow the cases of the sixteen civilians sentenced to death in August for treason and other charges and intervene at the appropriate moment if their sentence is upheld by the appeals court.   In your efforts to encourage reconciliation while holding perpetrators accountable, we thus urge you to avoid adding to the death toll in Sierra Leone by allowing the sentences to be carried out and instead seek punishments other than the death penalty. On Monday, the Sierra Leonean Minister of Information also stated that """"the law should also be applied in appropriate cases as a deterrent to avert a recurrence of this nightmare and to protect the citizens and the nation itself."""" Indeed, the death penalty has never been proven to have a deterrent effect on violent crime.   Despite the climate of public hatred for those accused of treason and other crimes, and calls for revenge killings, the government of Sierra Leone has thus far made courageous steps to uphold its obligations under international law and to avoid people taking justice into their own hands. In no circumstances, however, should a fair trial and the right to appeal be considered luxuries, even amidst public cries for revenge. Nor should the death penalty be imposed as an alleged solution to stop further abuses or in the name of protecting the public.   We thus respectfully urge your Excellency to ensure that the human rights of those sentenced to death in Sierra Leone are respected and wish you and the Sierra Leonean people success in rebuilding a Sierra Leone based firmly on the foundation of rule of law.

The FSB questions more than sixty people about Bellona's work on a report on the dangers of nuclear contamination caused by the Russian Northern Fleet. Prior to the raid, the Bellona Foundation had been operating openly in Murmansk. FEBRUARY 6, 1996-NIKITIN'S ARREST The FSB arrests Alexander Nikitin in St. Petersburg and charges him with treason in the form of espionage (article 64 of the criminal code). MARCH 27, 1996-CONSTITUTIONAL COURT GRANTS NIKITIN LAWYER The Constitutional Court rules that Nikitin must have access to a lawyer of his choice. The FSB had insisted that Nikitin's lawyer, Yury Schmidt, receive FSB security clearance. SEPTEMBER 1996-COUNCIL OF EUROPE APPOINTS RAPPORTEUR The Council of Europe appoints Dutch Senator Erik Jurgens as rapporteur on the Nikitin case. He is instructed to investigate the case and report on his findings to the Council. OCTOBER 18, 1996-BELLONA REPORTS CONFISCATED Customs officials confiscate more than 1,500 copies of the Bellona report, The Russian Northern Fleet: Sources of Radioactive Contamination, at the St. Petersburg airport, claiming it had been banned from distribution in Russia. At the same time, Bellona employees are banned from travelling to St. Petersburg, and eventually denied Russian visas. DECEMBER 14, 1996-NIKITIN RELEASED FROM FSB DETENTION Following an intervention by the Procurator General's office in Moscow, Nikitin is released from pretrial detention. The case is returned to the FSB for further investigation. JANUARY 27, 1997-PROCURATOR: NO SECRET LEGISLATION Deputy Procurator General Mikhail Katyshev orders the FSB not to use secret legislation as the basis for the indictment. The FSB ignores the order. MARCH 2, 1997-COUNCIL OF EUROPE REPORT Council of Europe Special Rapporteur Jurgens reports in Strasbourg about the Nikitin case. He expresses concern about the use of secret decrees, flawed expert assessments and slanted reporting in the media. AUTUMN 1997-INVESTIGATION TEAM RESHUFFLED Chief investigator for the Nikitin case suddenly dies of unknown causes. His predecessor, Boris Utkin, had been dismissed. In 1996, the FSB removed Utkin's predecessor from the case and fired him. MAY 1998-NIKITIN AND LAWYER HARASSED Unknown men believed to be linked to the FSB follow Nikitin around St. Petersburg for several days and slash his tires three times. The same men tell Ivan Pavlov, one of Nikitin's lawyers, to """"stay away from this case."""" The FSB denies any involvement. MAY 8, 1998-FINAL INDICTMENT The FSB delivers its seventh and final indictment. It no longer contains references to specific points of the secret decrees but the decrees still form the basis for the charges. For a legal explanation of this indictment, see Human Rights Watch's letter of June 1, 1998 on our website: http://www.hrw.org.  SEPTEMBER 24, 1998-FAIR TRIAL CONCERNS - LAY ASSESSORS Council of Europe Special Rapporteur Jurgens expresses concern that Nikitin's chances for a fair trial are jeopardized, as the case will be heard by one professional judge and two lay assessors who have to receive security clearance from the FSB.

Nikitin is being tried on the basis of secret government decrees that have never been publicly revealed -- even after he was charged with violating them. Led by the Federal Security Service (FSB), the criminal investigation has dragged on for three years. The FSB stubbornly resisted persistent calls from the international community to drop the charges and to correct some of the serious due process violations it committed throughout the case. Nikitin's fate is now in the hands of the St. Petersburg City Court (Naberezhnaya reki Fontanka 16, St. Petersburg), with Judge Sergei Golets and two lay assessors presiding. The trial will be partially open to the press. If convicted, Nikitin faces a maximum twenty-year prison sentence. The court may also either acquit or return the case to the FSB for further investigation. However, Russian judges are usually reluctant to acquit defendants and prefer to send criminal cases back to investigators, especially in sensitive cases. The Nikitin case could still drag on for some time. Judge Golets's initial rulings prior to the trial have been encouraging. At Nikitin's request, he opened parts of the initially closed trial to the press and observers, and ordered the Ministry of Defense to provide copies of the secret decrees under which Nikitin has been charged. To date, neither Nikitin nor his attorney has had access to the decrees, which list items that are classified as state secrets. """"The Russian government has behaved unscrupulously in this case,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Cental Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It has been willing to allow the FSB dictate its terms, and displayed contempt for free speech, for due process and for the environment."""" Important research on nuclear safety has virtually ceased because environmental activists no longer feel safe conducting this kind of research. The government intervened in the case once, in late 1996 when the case started jeopardizing government interests. The U.S. government, the European Union, and the Council of Europe constantly raised the case at international meetings. Russia opted for a compromise apparently aimed at appeasing both the international community and the FSB: It released Nikitin in December 1996 but gave the FSB a free hand to deal with the case.

These well-meaning suggestions miss the point. The problem is that Cuban laws criminalize free speech and free assembly and undercut defendants' rights to a fair trial. These provisions allow the Cuban government to claim, with some credibility, that it adheres to the rule of law. The Cuban government has detained the four leaders of the Internal Dissidents' Working Group (Grupo de Trabajo de la Disidencia Interna, GTDI), for over fourteen months in maximum security prisons, without trial. The dissident leaders, who have all been labeled counterrevolutionaries, are Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello, an economist, Vladimiro Roca Antúnez, also an economist, Félix Antonio Bonne Carcasses, a professor, and René Gómez Manzano, an attorney. Though the dissidents were arrested on July 16, 1997, Cuban prosecutors only charged them with a crime in September 1998. The prosecutors have announced their intention to seek a six-year term for Roca Antúnez and five-year sentences for the other three.  The Cuban criminal code serves as the foundation of Cuba's repressive machinery by criminalizing the freedom of expression. Cuba has repeatedly refused to modify criminal code provisions that restrict the fundamental rights to free speech, association, and movement.  Background on the Internal Dissidents' Working Group On May 5, 1997, the Internal Dissidents' Working Group (Grupo de Trabajo de la Disidencia Interna, GTDI) held a press conference in Havana encouraging a boycott of elections planned for late 1997. More than fifteen foreign press agencies attended the event, where the GTDI opposed participation in the election on the grounds that one-party Human Rights Watch Press Advisory elections do not offer the electorate genuine choices. The lack of government interference at the press conference marked a rare departure from usual government practices. The four prominent dissident leaders of the GTDI, Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello, Vladimiro Roca Antúnez, Félix Antonio Bonne Carcasses, and René Gómez Manzano, followed the press conference with the June release of a paper titled """"The Homeland Belongs to All"""" (La Patria es de Todos), which offered an analysis of Cuba's economy, proposed reforms to the Cuban constitution, discussed human rights, and challenged Cuba's exclusive recognition of one political party. On July 16, 1997, Cuban police arrested the four leaders of the GTDI. The Cuban authorities categorized the dissidents' peaceful protests as """"counterrevolutionary crimes."""" The government sent each of the leaders to separate prisons, where they are held with convicted violent criminals and subjected to extremely poor conditions. Roca Antúnez is in the Ariza prison in Cienfuegos Province, where the prison authorities have failed to provide him with medical attention for high-blood pressure and restricted his family visits. Bonne Carcasses is in the Guanajay Prison in Havana Province and Gómez Manzano in the Aguïca Prison in Matanzas Province. Roque Cabello spent several months in the prison ward of the Carlos J. Findlay Hospital in Havana, where she received insufficient treatment for serious medical conditions, including breast tumors and a gastric ulcer. Cuban authorities are now detaining her in the Manto Negro Prison in Havana Province. On July 30, 1998, the four members of the Internal Dissidents' Working Group filed a habeus corpus petition. A Havana tribunal rejected it the next day. The Crime of Sedition The Cuban Criminal Code's definition of sedition explicitly includes nonviolent opposition to the government. Those who """"perturb the socialist order or the celebration of elections or referendums, or impede the completion of any sentence, legal disposition or measure dictated by the Government, or by a civil or military authority in the exercise of their respective functions, or refuse to obey them"""" can face from ten to twenty years in prison, even if they do so """"without relying on arms or employing violence."""" The provision explicitly serves to protect the """"socialist order."""" Crimes Against State Security Cuba defines sedition as a crime against state security. Other state security crimes include enemy propaganda and rebellion, two provisions that the government has frequently invoked to silence nonviolent dissent. While the crime of enemy propaganda explicitly violates the fundamental freedoms of expression and association, other state security crimes include objectionable references to preserving the socialist system and are defined in elastic terms that frequently have been used to punish the exercise of fundamental rights.  Cuba insists that it has legitimate reasons for charging nonviolent dissidents with state security crimes. But international human rights and legal experts distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate justifications for prosecuting crimes against state security. Some legitimate reasons to invoke national security interests include: protecting a country's existence or its territorial integrity against the threat or use of force; or responding to incitement to the violent overthrow of the government. In contrast, illegitimate justifications for invoking national security interests include: preserving a particular ideology; protecting the state from criticism or insults; preventing the dissemination of information about human rights; or, impeding advocates for nonviolent change of the government or government policies.  Charging dissidents with state security crimes affords the Cuban authorities opportunities to legally bypass dissidents' basic due process guarantees. Under the Cuban criminal procedure code, Cuban authorities may conduct warrantless arrests of any person accused of a state security crime, must hold the accused in pre-trial detention, and must try the person in a closed trial in special state security tribunal.  Recent Prosecutions of Cuban Dissidents Several recent trials demonstrate Cuba's willingness to use the criminal code to silence dissent. The Cuban government has also used short-term arbitrary detentions, warnings of future prosecutions, and surveillance to harass its nonviolent critics.  On August 28, 1998, a Havana court sentenced Reynaldo Alfaro García, vice-president of the Association for the Struggle Against National Injustice (Asociación para la Lucha Frente a la Injusticia Nacional) and a member of the Democratic Solidarity Party (Partido de Solidaridad Democrática, PSD), to three years for spreading false news. Police had arrested him on May 8, 1997, after he called for the release of political prisoners and denounced prison beatings.  On April 24, 1998, a Santiago court found Julio César Coizeau Rizo, a member of the Club of Ex Political Prisoners """"Geraldo González"""" (Club de Ex-Presos Políticos """"Geraldo González""""), guilty of contempt for authority. The court sentenced him to three years for posting some twenty anti-government flyers. On February 13, 1998, a Santa Clara tribunal sentenced Cecilio Monteagudo Sánchez, a PSD vice-delegate, to four years in prison for enemy propaganda. Cuban police arrested him on September 15, 1997, after he had drafted, but not published, a document calling for abstention from local elections. The same tribunal convicted Juan Carlos Recio Martínez, a local journalist with the Cuba Press agency whom Monteagudo Sánchez had asked to type the document, of failing to comply with his duty to denounce (incumplimiento del deber de denunciar) and sentenced him to one year in a labor camp without internment (correccional sin internamiento).  On March 12, 1998, a Cienfuegos court found five members of the Pro Human Rights Party of Cuba (Partido Pro Derechos Humanos de Cuba, PPDH), Israel García Hidalgo, Benito Fojaco Iser, Angel Nicolás Gonzalo, José Ramón López Filgueira, and Reynaldo Sardiñas Delgado, guilty of other acts committed against state security (otras actas contra la seguridad del estado). Police had arrested them in October 1997. The tribunal sentenced García Hidalgo and Fojaco Iser to two years in prison, while López Filgueira received a one-year sentence. Sixty-nine-year-old Gonzalo and sixty-six-year-old Sardiñas Delgado both received one-year sentences to labor camps without internment.  On November 18, 1997, a Santiago tribunal tried Dr. Dessy Mendoza Rivero, president of the Independent Medical College of Santiago (Colegio Médico Independiente de Santiago), found him guilty of enemy propaganda, and sentenced him to eight years. Cuban police arrested Dr. Mendoza in June 1997, shortly after he alerted the international press of a dengue fever epidemic in Santiago.  Cuban Criminal Code and Criminal Procedure  Cuba has rejected pleas to repeal provisions of its criminal code that violate fundamental rights. These provisions include enemy propaganda, a crime against state security that criminalizes dissent and independent reporting. Cuba's provision against contempt for authority (desacato), punishes those who offend high-ranking authorities with one to three years in prison. The criminal code's dangerousness (el estado peligroso) and official warning (advertencia oficial) provisions permit authorities to imprison or mandate police surveillance of individuals who demonstrate criminal tendencies but have committed no criminal act. Cuba retains on its books the crime of illegal exit, which prohibits unapproved emigration. Cuba's associations law effectively bars the establishment of independent groups, leaving members at risk of up to one year in prison.  Cuban legislation undercuts the right to a fair trial by allowing political figures to control the courts, granting broad authority for warrantless arrests and pre-trial detentions and restricting the right to a defense. The Cuban Constitution states that citizens have the right to a defense, but other legal provisions seriously debilitate this right. The government has banned independent associations of lawyers, while the judicial and prosecutorial authorities are highly politicized and powerful. Cuban Prison Conditions Human Rights Watch interviews with former political prisoners, dissident groups, and prisoners' family members reveal that Cuban political prisoners face serious human rights abuses. Cuba's confinement of nonviolent political prisoners with prisoners convicted of violent crimes is degrading and dangerous. Many Cuban political prisoners spend excessive periods in isolation cells, both during pre-trial and post-conviction detention. Police or prison guards often heighten the punitive nature of solitary confinement with additional sensory deprivation, by darkening cells, removing clothing, or restricting food and water. Prison authorities punish political prisoners who denounce prison abuses. Punitive measures against political prisoners that cause severe suffering and retaliations against those who denounce abuses violate Cuba's obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which it ratified in 1995.  Whether held for political or common crimes, inmates endure severe hardships in Cuba's prisons. Most prisoners face malnourishment on the prison diet and suffer in overcrowded cells without sufficient medical attention. Prison authorities insist that all detainees participate in politically oriented reeducation sessions, such as chanting """"Long live Fidel"""" or """"Socialism or Death,"""" or face punitive measures including beatings and solitary confinement. Prison guards in men's facilities rely on """"prisoners' councils"""" (consejos de reclusos) to maintain internal discipline with beatings and control over the meager food rations. Prison authorities restrict inmates' access to receiving religious guidance, in some cases with interrogations about their religious beliefs. In some prisons, pre-trial detainees are held together with convicts and minors with adults. Minors risk indefinite detention in juvenile facilities.  Cuba's refusal to allow prison monitoring makes arriving at a precise number of political prisoners impossible. The Cuban government bars regular access to its prisons by domestic and international human rights and humanitarian monitors. In recent years, the numbers of political prisoners declined due to a general trend toward shorter prison terms. One Cuban human rights group estimates that, following the releases in the wake of Pope John Paul II's January trip to Cuba, approximately 400 political prisoners remained.","Americas, Cuba",""

The Manila meeting is focused on women, and Human Rights Watch urged the delegates to heed the call of seven major women's advocacy organizations in Malaysia who issued a press statement on October 3 condemning the ill-treatment by police of detained former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and those who demonstrated peacefully for political reform. The women's groups also called for an end to the use of the Internal Security Act, a law that allows for indefinite detention without charge or trial. The annual APEC summit, attended by heads of state from eighteen countries, will take place in Kuala Lumpur next month.

The delegates from countries throughout the region should offer Dr. Wan Azizah their active support during the APEC summit. Since Anwar Ibrahim's detention under the ISA, his wife has been forbidden to address public meetings and is being investigated on possible sedition charges.

The United States, however, has executed eight juvenile offenders during this time period, more than the reported total for any other nation in the world. Human Rights Watch also noted a disturbing trend of executing juvenile offenders who may be mentally retarded. During 1998, two other juvenile offenders—Joseph John Cannon and Robert Anthony Carter—have been executed in the United States. Like Dwayne Allen Wright, both were reported to be brain damaged, and border-line mentally retarded.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/10/12/better-protection-rapes-investigators-needed","Better Protection Of Rapes Investigators Needed","Better Protection Of Rapes Investigators Needed","","10/12/1998","(New York)-- Human Rights Watch today called for a full and independent investigation into the murder on Friday of Martadinata Haryono, known as Ita, a young Chinese-Indonesian woman in Jakarta. It also called for better protection of members of the Volunteer Team for Humanity who are investigating rapes of ethnic Chinese women. Ita's mother is a member of the team, and Ita herself had taken part in many of its activities. Her murder has raised concerns among Indonesian human rights groups that it represents an escalation of a campaign to terrorize those investigating the rapes; Jakarta police say it is a purely criminal case. The Volunteer Team for Humanity, better known by its Indonesian name of Tim Relawan, has been the lead organization documenting reports of systematic rape, primarily of ethnic Chinese women, in Jakarta and other cities during riots last May. """"Three of the most visible members of the Volunteer Team for Humanity -- Father Sandyawan, Karlina Leksono, and Ita Fathia Nadia -- have been threatened repeatedly since the issue of the rapes first arose,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Now there is a murder of a person closely linked to their work. At the very least, the Indonesian government has an obligation to conduct fully transparent investigations, not only into this murder but into the numerous threats and other forms of intimidation that those investigating the rapes have endured over the last three months. It should take extra measures to protect members of Tim Relawan. And Indonesian officials, military and civilian, should cease any further comments on the rape investigations until the full report of the Joint Fact-Finding Team is formally presented."""" The Joint Fact-Finding Team, appointed by the government in August to look into the May violence, is due to make its findings public on October 23. Members of the Tim Relawan have been called in the middle of the night and warned to stop investigating the rapes. Their children have also been the target of threats and obscene telephone calls. The threats have come as senior government officials have been making contradictory remarks about the rapes, with Defense Minister and Commander of the Armed Forces General Wiranto denying they took place, and Justice Minister Muladi saying they were widespread and systematic. As of early Monday, there appeared to be many contradictory reports about the murder of Martadinata as well. Police said there were no indications of rape; some press reports suggested she had been sexually assaulted. Police said the man apprehended in the murder, a neighbor named Suryadi, confessed that he had intended only to rob the house to pay off his father's debt; rights activists have pointed out that nothing of value was taken. In response, police said that in his """"confession,"""" Suryadi said he realized that Ita had recognized him and that was why he killed her. Police-induced """"confessions"""" in Indonesia are so common, however, that a suspect's admission immediately after interrogation should not be taken at face value, even less the police report of such a statement.

On Wednesday, October 7, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) announced that the Yugoslav authorities had denied visa requests for ICTY investigators to probe recent atrocities. The Yugoslav authorities have stated that they do not recognize the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over war crimes committed in Kosovo.   """"It is essential that the perpetrators of war crimes in Kosovo be brought to justice,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"President Milosevic wants to hide evidence of atrocities by his troops. He cannot be allowed to dictate the terms of the investigation. Time is of the essence, and the international community must demand that the ICTY is allowed to carry out an immediate, unconditional and unimpeded investigation.""""   The investigation of war crimes committed in Kosovo is a time-sensitive matter, and delays resulting from obstruction by the Yugoslav authorities jeopardize the possibility of bringing the perpetrators of abuses to justice, the organization said. Evidence deteriorates and may be destroyed, the memory of witnesses fades, and a real possibility of government interference or harassment of witnesses exists. Human Rights Watch urges the ICTY to intensify its efforts to investigate allegatiosn of war crimes in Kosovo in a timely manner.   Since the beginning of the Kosovo conflict, Human Rights Watch has documented and investigated numerous allegations of war crimes committed by Yugoslav forces in Kosovo. These abuses include summary executions of civilians and suspected members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), torture, the targeting of civilians during military operations, and the wanton and widespread destruction of civilian property and objects essential to the survival of civilian population. There have also been credible allegations of violations of the law of war committed by the KLA, but the government has refused to allow independent investigators and the ICTY to investigate these allegations as well.   The Security Council created the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in May 1993 to prosecute war crimes committed during the wars in former Yugoslavia beginning in 1991. The Security Council has specified no termination date to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. On March 10, shortly after hostilities broke out in Kosovo, the Chief Prosecutor for the Tribunal, Chief Justice Louise Arbour announced that she considered Kosovo to be within her jurisdiction. She put both sides to the conflict on notice that she would commence an investigation of any violations of international humanitarian law committed there.   The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly affirmed that the ICTY's jurisdiction extends to Kosovo. Most recently, on September 23, the Security Council """"call[ed] upon the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the leaders of the Kosovo Albanian community and all others concerned to cooperate fully with the Prosecutor of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the investigation of possible violations within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.""""   The Yugoslav authorities are bound to cooperate with the Tribunal under numerous Security Council resolutions and the Dayton Peace Agreement that resolved the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Notwithstanding these commitments, the Yugoslav government has consistently ignored the Tribunal's authority and openly harbored a number of publicly indicted war crimes suspects.   Since the outbreak of hostilities in late February, Human Rights Watch has conducted two missions to the region and documented serious violations of humanitarian law falling within the Tribunal's jurisdiction.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan, the organization requested the removal of Brigadier-General Sergio Espinoza Davies as head of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) because of his role as a member of secretive """"war tribunals"""" which judged political opponents during the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. In one case in October 1973, Espinoza's tribunal sentenced six socialist leaders to death after an irregular proceeding. Four of the men were executed the next morning. UNMOGIP is deployed on the ceasefire line between India and Pakistan in the State of Jammu and Kashmir to monitor the observance of the ceasefire of December 1971.  Because of his role in the tribunals, Brigadier-General Espinoza is """"unfit to lead a peacekeeping mission that seeks to uphold the international human rights principles upon which the United Nations was founded,"""" said Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's representative to the United Nations.

September 28, 1998 H.E. Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan United Nations Headquarters - S-3800 New York, N.Y. 10017 Dear Mr. Secretary General, We are writing to urge you to remove Chilean Brig.-Gen. Sergio Espinoza Davies as Chief Military Observer of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP). Reliable public information reveals that Brigadier-General Espinoza participated in grave abuses of human rights during the Pinochet dictatorship in Chile. Shortly after the September 1973 coup in Chile, Brigadier-General Espinoza, then a captain, served on at least one war tribunal (""""consejo de guerra"""") that sentenced individuals to prison and death after proceedings that violated the most fundamental judicial guarantees of due process.  The Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation found that judges on the war tribunals had an """"unsatisfactory level of ... knowledge of basic principles of law"""" and that """"most of them were not lawyers."""" After a careful analysis of several cases involving the war tribunals, the Commission concluded that """"in many of the deaths said to have followed from a decision by a war tribunal it should be assumed that no such trial took place and that this was simply a way of explaining an illegal execution."""" In other words, the tribunals were used as a facade to justify extrajudicial killings. Moreover, in cases in which a process did take place, the Commission found specific """"irregularities in both substance and form"""" leading it to """"regard all the deaths to which they led as human rights violations."""" [See Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation, Vol. 1, Notre Dame, Indiana: Center for Civil & Human Rights, Notre Dame Law School, 1993, pp.139 and 259.] Brigadier-General Espinoza directly participated in the violations committed by Chile's abusive war tribunals. In one case on October 29, 1973, the Pisagua war tribunal on which Espinoza sat sentenced to death for treason six leaders of the Socialist Party of Iquique. (A copy of the tribunal's judgment is attached.) Four of the condemned men were immediately executed. Their bodies have never been accounted for. According to the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation, in addition to the irregularities which pervaded all war tribunals, the Pisagua death sentences in which Espinoza participated suffered from a particular """"lack of legality"""" because the verdicts were not unanimous (though Espinoza voted for the death penalty), the crimes were not proven, the crimes were alleged to have occurred before a state of war was declared, and because the """"sole method of proof cited in the judgment to substantiate the participation of the condemned men in the crimes in question was the accused men's supposed confessions."""" As the Commission found that """"torture was used systematically"""" in the Pisagua jail in which the prisoners had been held, it considered such proof to be """"invalid."""" The Commission therefore found the trial to have """"violated the rules which safeguard the human rights of the accused.""""

HRW translation of Spanish original.] A member of this tribunal who served with Espinoza, Juan Enrique Sinn Bruno, recently alleged that the tribunal, acting on superior orders, had changed its original sentence from ten years in prison to death.  Because of the secrecy of proceedings, the extent of Espinoza's participation in other war tribunals remains unclear.  Human Rights Watch believes that Brigadier-General Espinoza's documented participation in the worst human rights abuses in his home country renders him unfit to lead a peacekeeping mission that seeks to uphold the international human rights principles upon which the United Nations was founded. We respectfully urge you to remove him from his position and appoint a new head of the peacekeeping mission with the appropriate credentials. We greatly appreciate your attention to this matter.

Tens of thousands of children are being used as soldiers by all sides to thebloody conflict underway in Colombia, according to a Human Rights Watch report released today. Up to thirty percent of some guerrilla units are made up of children. The number of children in some militias, considered a training ground for future guerrilla fighters, is reported to be as high as 85 percent. Although most of Colombia's child soldiers are over fifteen, all sides are recruiting children younger than fifteen, in violation of the laws of war. The three sides to the conflict are guerillas, national security units, and paramilitaries. Human Rights Watch found that child guerrillas are used to collect intelligence, make and deploy mines, and serve as advance troops in ambush attacks against paramilitaries, soldiers, and police officers. Those who manage to escape are considered deserters and may be subjected to on-the-spot execution.  Colombia's national security forces, including the army and National Police, include over 15,000 children. Thousands of others are recruited for civic outreach and placed in war zones in uniform, at serious risk of attack. The army also captures or accepts the surrender of children suspected of being guerrillas, then uses them as guides or informants. These children may be forced to patrol with troops, take part in combat, collect intelligence, and deactivate land mines.  Paramilitary units, which often operate in direct coordination with national security forces and are responsible for some of the conflict's worst abuses, also include large numbers of children. Children as young as eight years of age have been seen patrolling with paramilitaries, and up to 50 percent of some units are made up of children.  """"This use of children is appalling,"""" says Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"All parties to the conflict should immediately stop all recruitment of children under the age of eighteen, and should demobilize all child soldiers currently in their ranks.""""  International law prohibits the recruitment of any children under the age of 15, and an international consensus is building on behalf of prohibitions on any military recruitment below the age of 18. Under the new International Criminal Court treaty drafted in July in Rome, the conscription and use in hostilities of children under the age of 15 is defined as a war crime, to be prosecuted by the Court.  In late June, Human Rights Watch, together with Amnesty International and other leading international nongovernmental organizations, launched a new Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which seeks stronger international standards to protect children from military recruitment and use in armed conflict. The Coalition is campaigning to raise the minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict from 15, set by existing international law, to 18.

José Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch, noted that the inauguration of a new president in August has given many Colombians fresh hope for an end to political violence, while a broad-based peace movement is also gathering momentum. """"There are some encouraging moves toward peace in Colombia,"""" said Vivanco, """"but it's impossible to build peace in the midst of these massive and systematic violations of the laws of war. All of the parties must abandon tactics that put civilian lives and homes at risk."""" Vivanco noted that 1,250 combatants were killed in combat in 1997, but 2,183 non-combatants were killed that same year, for political reasons. The Human Rights Watch report, titled """"War Without Quarter: Colombia and International Humanitarian Law"""" (225 pp.), is the result of a two-year, in-depth investigation. It documents how all sides to the conflict have recruited children under the age of fifteen as soldiers. The report also charges that the warring parties are responsible for displacing an estimated one million people, many of them non-combatants. Colombia now has the world's fourth-largest internally displaced population in the world, after Sudan, Angola, and Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch researchers traveled to conflict areas to interview witnesses, victims, government investigators, and security force personnel and collected substantial documentary evidence. Human Rights Watch representatives met with leaders of all parties to the conflict, including then-president Ernesto Samper, former armed forces commander Gen. Manuel Bonett, Carlos Castaño, leader of the paramilitary group known as the United Self-Defense Group of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC), and several guerrilla leaders. The group also submitted to each of the parties lists of violations attributed to their forces for comment. In the report, Human Rights Watch concludes that paramilitary groups, often working in coordination with the Colombian army, are the principal violators of the laws of war. The report offers detailed evidence that the army tolerates and sometimes directly supports paramilitary groups in their terror campaigns against their political enemies. The army provides some paramilitary groups with intelligence and logistical support to carry out operations, and actively promotes and coordinates with others, in some cases conducting joint maneuvers. Human Rights Watch called on the Colombian government to adopt immediate and far-reaching efforts to stop paramilitary groups and arrest their leaders. To wage their offensives, these paramilitary groups depend on the explicit, deliberate, and systematic violation of the laws of war, including massacres, the execution of civilians and combatants hors de combat, torture, the mutilation of corpses, death threats, forced displacement, hostage-taking and looting. Guerrilla groups, such as FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), have also frequently violated the laws of war. They have murdered civilians; executed wounded soldiers and police officers; destroyed civilian homes, shops, and vehicles; and kidnapped defenseless victims. """"The guerrillas have adopted the rhetoric of the laws of war,"""" noted Vivanco, """"but those are only words. They, too, are guilty of systematic violations."""" The report cites one guerilla manual that openly advises tactics that violate international humanitarian law, among them attacks on civilians that contribute no direct military advantage to guerrilla forces. Among the illustrations that accompany the Human Rights Watch report is a drawing from another guerilla group, showing a mouse-human hanging from a gibbet, a grim warning to the civilians they suspect of aiding their enemies.","Americas, Colombia",""

In the new report, """"Unwanted and Unprotected: Burmese Refugees in Thailand,"""" Human Rights Watch said that even with the May 1998 agreement formalizing working arrangements between Thailand and UNHCR, significant gaps in refugee protection remained. Burmese refugees in Thailand will continue to be in danger, the organization said, until UNHCR has full and unimpeded access to all Burmese refugees in Thailand, is able to conduct screening of newly arrived asylum-seekers, and has guarantees that repatriation will take place only when human rights conditions in Burma are conducive to return. The report says the danger to refugees has been exacerbated by the fact that Thailand is among the hardest hit of the countries struck by the Asian economic crisis. In its efforts to deport undocumented migrant workers, of whom Burmese are the overwhelming majority, the Thai government makes little distinction between refugees and migrants. Because of the lack of effective refugee status determination procedures, it may be deporting people with a valid claim to refugee status, if only they had the opportunity to assert it. Human Rights Watch identifies part of the problem as stemming from Thailand's failure to ratify the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, the treaty that establishes the legal regime for refugee protection, and calls on the Royal Thai Government to immediately become party to that treaty. It calls for the immediate cessation of the Thai practice, in effect since June, of closing its borders to new asylum seekers. Rejection at the border of those with a well-founded fear of persecution is a violation of Thailands's obligations under international law.  Part of the problem also lies with UNHCR. While acknowledging the constraints the agency faces because of its need to maintain relations with Thailand, Human Rights Watch says UNCHR """"has been unnecessarily weak in its efforts to challenge the Thai policies that undermine refugee protection.""""  Human Rights Watch is particularly critical of the Burmese government, whose policies are ultimately responsible for the influx of refugees into Thailand. It notes the role that Burmese government policies of forced labor and forced displacement have played in the exodus of Burmese to Thailand. Human Rights Watch urges the government to comply with the U.N. Commission on Human Rights resolution of April 20, 1998, which calls on the government in Rangoon to address specific human rights concerns and create the conditions that would enable refugees to return. The new report is based on Human Rights Watch research conducted since 1988. It examines the factors affecting Thai policy, including its experience with Indochinese refugees in the 1970s and 1980s, and the changing relations betweeen Thailand and Burma. It profiles the two major groups of refugees from Burma: the """"students"""" -- a catch-all phrase to denote the mostly urban students and professional who took part in the 1988 uprising and subsequent political protests, and members of the different ethnic minority groups living close to the Thai border, who have fled armed conflict, forced displacement, forced labor, and other abuses. Those groups include the Karen, the Karenni, the Mon, and the Shan in particular.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi Head of the Judiciary Park-e Shahr Tehran Islamic Republic of Iran Your Excellency: Human Rights Watch is writing this open letter to express its deep concern about the arrest and incommunicado detention in solitary confinement since September 16 of four staff members from Tous, a daily newspaper, which was banned the same day. We fear that the real motive in jailing and prosecuting the four journalists is to punish them for their activities as journalists and writers, and to intimidate other independent-minded journalists in Iran. Mr. Hamid Reza Jalei-Pour and Mr. Mohammad Javadi-Hessar, both managers, Mr. Mashallah Shamsol-va-Ezine, an editor, and Mr. Ebrahim Nabavi, a staff writer with Tous were arrested on the order of the Revolutionary Court for publishing articles """"against security and general interests."""" Human Rights Watch fears that the detainees are being ill-treated in order to pressure them to sign false confessions. The detainees have been held incommunicado since their arrests with no access to their lawyers and their families. Only Mr. Jalei-Pour’s mother was permitted to visit him in Tehran on October 3. The Revolutionary Court’s order arresting these journalists appears to be in direct violation of Iran’s constitution which states that any offenses relating to the press should be brought before a designated press court. The Iranian press law stipulates that such courts should hold their proceedings in public and in the presence of a jury. The arbitrary detention of these four journalists is a violation of Iran’s obligation under international law. Article 9(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Iran is a party, requires states to ensure that: Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law. Article 14(3) of the ICCPR states that: In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled... (g) Not to be compelled to testify against himself or confess guilt. Incommunicado detention increases a detainee’s vulnerability to torture or ill-treatment. Moreover, denial of the right of access to counsel is a violation of internationally recognized standards for fair trial. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the prosecution of these four journalists is part of a campaign of repression and violence targeting independent media. On September 15, the Leader Ayatollah Khamene’i gave impetus to this campaign by threatening to use extra-legal force to silence independent newspapers which he characterized as """"a dangerous, creeping cultural movement...writing against Islam,"""" unless government officials took action against them. On the next day, the newspaper Tous which had gained a reputation and a wide readership among Iranians for its championing of reform was ordered closed. During the last few months, several newspapers and magazines have been closed. These include: Gozaresh-e Rouz, Khanneh, Jameh, Tous, Rah-e No, Tavana, Jameh Salem, Asr-e Ma. Human Rights Watch calls for the immediate and unconditional release of these four detained journalists. We seek assurances that while they are in detention they will be well treated and permitted access to legal counsel, independent medical doctors, and to their family members.

Only after ratification will China be legally bound by the treaty's provisions. The timing of China's decision to sign the ICCPR was clearly chosen to derive maximum political benefit. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, just completed a visit to China and Tibet on September 14. Tomorrow British Prime Minister Tony Blair is due to arrive in Beijing on an official visit. Earlier this year, Britain had taken the lead within the European Union to drop criticism of China at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in exchange for pledges by China to sign this treaty. The Clinton administration, which also abandoned action in Geneva, had lobbied for months to get the ICCPR signed before Clinton arrived in China in June; announcement of the date of today's signing in New York took place last week when Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan met with Clinton at the White House.  """"China's promise to sign this treaty bought international silence on its human rights practices,"""" said Jones. """"Signing could still be the right move for the wrong reasons but only if we see tangible human rights improvements."""" Those improvements should include releases of political prisoners and an end to the system of reeducation through labor, a form of arbitrary detention, Jones noted.

The report provides detailed evidence of serious breaches of international law, showing that Serbian special police and Yugoslav army units have executed civilians, systematically destroy ed civilian property, and attacked humanitarian aid workers. The report also describes how the ethnic Albanian insurgency, the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA), has violated the laws of war by taking civilian hostages and committing summary executions. While emphatically condemning these acts, the report also notes that they have occurred on a lesser scale than those attributable to government forces. """"It's been clear for seven months that the government is conducting a brutal war against civilians in Kosovo,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But they are operating in a climate of impunity. The atrocities we see today are taking place because the West failed to respond forcefully enough to Serb aggression from the very begi nning."""" The report condemns the Yugoslav government for restricting the ability of humanitarian aid workers adequately to treat the 250,000 people who have fled attacks on their villages. Many of these internally displaced people are women and children living without shelter in the mountains and woods, where harsh winter conditions are expected in coming weeks.  The Yugoslav government has also restricted the work of domestic and foreign journalists who seek to report the atrocities. Some ethnic Albanian journalists have been threatened, detained, or beaten by the police, and independent Serb media have been labeled """"traitors"""" or threatened with legal action for objective reporting on Kosovo. """"The Yugoslav government is trying to silence critical voices of any ethnic origin,"""" said Cartner. """"It wants to turn the media into propaganda tools for inciting Serb nationalism."""" The report says at least one hundred ethnic Albanians have """"disappeared"""" in Kosovo since February 1998, about half of whom were last seen in the custody of the police. On October 1, the Serbian Ministry of Justice announced that 1242 ethnic Albanians had been charged with committing """"terrorist acts,"""" 684 of whom are currently in detention. In July and August, detained individuals increasingly incl uded human rights activists, humanitarian aid workers, political party members, doctors, and lawyers, many of whom were physically abused. The use of torture against detainees is widespread, and five people are known to have died from abuse in prison. The report cites as a """"watershed"""" an attack by government forces in late February and early March in the Drenica region of central Kosovo, a stronghold of the KLA. Special police forces attacked three villages with artillery, helicopters, and armored vehicles, killing at least eighty-three people, twenty-four of them women and children. Although it is unclear to what extent the KLA was offering resistance, the evidence strongly suggests that at least seventeen people were executed after they had been detained or surrendered. Following the Drenica attack, the report says, thousands of outraged Albanians who had been committed to the nonviolent politics of Ibrahim Rugova, president of the shadow Kosovar Albanian state, decided to join the KLA. In the ensuing months, the KLA, called a """"liberation movement"""" by most ethnic Albanians and a """"terrorist organization"""" by the Yugoslav government, took control of an estimated 40 percent of Kosovo's territory. The first major government offensive began in mid-May, when the special police together with the Yugoslav Army attacked a string of towns and villages along the border with Albania in the west, with the specific intent of depopulating the region. Until then, the KLA had been receiving arms and fresh recruits from across the border. Many villages from Pe in the north to Dakovica in the south were shelled while civilians were still present. Noncombatants who fled the attacks were sometimes fired on by snipers, and a still undetermined number of people were taken into detention. In three cases, helicopters marked with the Red Cross emblem reportedly fired on civilians. Landmines were placed in strategic points along the bor der, as well as along the southern border with Macedonia. Most villages in the region were looted and systematically destroyed, and farmers' livestock was shot, to ensure that no one could return in the short-run. Fifteen thousand people fled to Albania and an estimated 30,000 went north to Montenegro. Three appendices to the report also provide eyewitness evidence of atrocities by Yugoslav government forces in late September 1998.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Unfortunately, at this time, there is little reason to be optimistic about the short-term future, as the Cambodian government has failed to address the fundamental human rights problems that plagued the pre-election period, including political violence, extrajudicial killings, and official impunity for abuses. These same problems now threaten to undermine prospects that any new government can gain the full confidence and support of the Cambodian people.   We believe that the international community was too hasty in endorsing both the elections process and the results as """"free and fair."""" The creation of yet another antagonistic coalition government between Prince Ranariddh and Hun Sen offers little hope of stability or human rights improvements.   While polling day itself drew large numbers of voters and was relatively peaceful, most of the year preceding election day was tainted by political violence, widespread intimidation, monopoly of the broadcast media by the ruling party, and murders of opposition members and supporters of Ranariddh.   Most of the international observer delegations flew in only days before the elections, gave their approval, and left as quickly as they came. Meanwhile, following the elections, hundreds of opposition activists fled their homes in the provinces after receiving threats of reprisals and death from local officials. In late August, unprecedented numbers of people took to the streets in Phnom Penh to protest the election results. Violence escalated, with a grenade attack at the Ministry of Interior on August 20 when Sam Rainsy was inside the compound. There were also mob killings of at least four ethnic Vietnamese on September 3 and 4 in conjunction with rumors that Vietnamese food vendors were poisoning the population.   On September 7, more than a week of civil unrest erupted in Phnom Penh, and riot police used lethal force to disperse opposition demonstrators. The protestors were mostly peaceful, though some did engage in violence such as stone-throwing. Since September 7, two deaths have been confirmed and more than thirty are under investigation by human rights workers. At least sixty people were wounded in the demonstrations, including fourteen who were sent to the hospital with bullet wounds. In addition, security forces detained more than twenty people, including students and monks, and many more people were reported as missing.   U.S. Policy Recommendations:   We urge the Clinton Administration, and members of this Committee, to insist upon concrete action by the Cambodian government -- as outlined below -- before the U.S. restores any bilateral or multilateral aid to Phnom Penh. We continue to strongly favor assistance to Cambodian NGOs, however.   The U.S. should publicly and privately support the efforts of the U.N. Secretary General's Special Representative, Thomas Hammarberg, who has called on the Cambodian government to:   --publicly acknowledge all instances of arrest and detention in connection with the demonstrations earlier this month;   -- make known the names of all detainees and their whereabouts, and any charges against them; in the absence of credible charges, they should be immediately released;   --open all places of detention to the International Committee of the Red Cross;   --investigate and prosecute those responsible for disappearances since the September 7 crackdown as well as those that took place prior to the elections;   -- fully investigate and prosecute the apparent killings of at least 16 people whose bodies have been found in recent weeks floating in rivers, irrigation ditches and shallow graves around Phnom Penh;   -- cease all threats to arrest and prosecute opposition leaders, such as Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha (former head of the parliamentary human rights committee), for exercising their rights of free speech and political participation.   Until the Cambodian government demonstrates a willingness to begin taking these steps, the U.S. should continue withholding direct government aid and urge other donors to do the same.   The U.S. should also help provide protection to courageous Cambodian NGOs, including human rights monitors, who are struggling to lay the groundwork for long term peaceful change. We are deeply concerned about police threats against the staff of the U.N. Centre for Human Rights in Phnom Penh.   In addition, we believe it is crucial that the United Nations continue to maintain a visible presence in Cambodia during this transition period. It is likely that political violence, arrests and killings will continue, and perhaps even accelerate, once agreement is reached on the composition of a new government. Acts of retaliation and retribution have been all too common in Cambodia in the past.   We hope the Administration will endorse the continuation of the mandate of the UN Secretary General's Personal Representative, Mr. Lakhan Mehrotra, as well as the mandate of the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (COHCHR) -- which Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has repeatedly tried to shut down. The COHCHR is currently due to operate until March 1999. But in light of the commune level elections scheduled for sometime next year, and ongoing reports of abuses, it should be extended and if possible, additional funding provided for the staff to be expanded.   Finally, we appreciate the efforts of the United States -- in the face of general donor weariness or """"Cambodia fatigue"""" -- to encourage ASEAN, members of the European Union, Japan, and other key donors to press for basic human rights improvements, which are clearly essential to bringing about reconciliation, stability, and long-term economic development in Cambodia. The statements of some ASEAN governments at the UN General Assembly in New York on September 28 were particularly encouraging, and it appears that Cambodia's ASEAN membership remains on hold until ASEAN is confident that a legitimate and stable government is in place. The U.S. and other donors should also continue to vigorously condemn violent attacks on ethnic Vietnamese living in Cambodia.   Human Rights Developments   Hun Sen began to lay the groundwork for the 1998 elections in late 1997 by sending a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on October 22, guaranteeing the safe return of opposition politicians who fled after the coup and pledging to organize fair elections. By the end of November, the office of the United Nations Secretary-General's Representative in Cambodia (OSGRC) had created a new unit of international personnel, mandated to monitor the physical security and safety of returning political leaders, their freedom from arrest and detention, and their ability to engage in political activities. By early 1998, most had returned. These included Prince Ranariddh's party, Front Uni National pour un Cambodge Independent, Neutre, Pacifique, et Cooperatif, or FUNCINPEC; Sam Rainsy's Khmer Nation Party (KNP); and the Son Sann faction of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP). Throughout the first half of the year, the CPP was virtually the only party able to freely and actively conduct political activities throughout the country. It was not until May that opposition parties were legally recognized and not until June that they were fully registered to participate in the election.   Until mid-February, a political impasse over Prince Ranariddh's ability to participate in the elections threatened to block international donor support for the vote. Hun Sen charged that Prince Ranariddh had imported illegal weapons in 1997 and mounted an armed opposition with Khmer Rouge support against government forces. In February, however, a group of donor and neighboring countries known as the Friends of Cambodia endorsed a peace initiative put forward by Japan, and Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh agreed. Dubbed the """"Four Pillars"""" plan, it called for an immediate cease-fire and reintegration of resistance forces into the government army, the severing of by Prince Ranariddh's ties with the Khmer Rouge, the trial of Ranariddh in absentia followed by his pardon by King Sihanouk, and government guarantees of Prince Ranariddh's safe return to Cambodia.   A pattern of violence against lower-level opposition party workers in remote areas of the countryside began to emerge early in the year, especially after activists in some provinces made tentative first steps to reactivate grassroots networks. A National Election Committee (NEC) was formed in January to organize and monitor the elections and verify the accuracy of the final tally, but it was dominated by the CPP. Similarly, the Constitutional Council, the nation's highest appeals body, which was mandated to resolve electoral disputes and verify the accuracy of the final tally, had a disproportionate number of CPP-affiliated members and was established too late to address most election-related disputes. At party congresses in Phnom Penh in March, two leading opposition parties changed their names because of legal battles with pro-CPP rival factions. The KNP became the Sam Rainsy Party, and one faction of the BLDP became the Son Sann Party. During political party registration, which began on March 28, thirty-nine parties were approved by the Ministry of Interior and the NEC.   March and April were characterized by a wave of political violence. High-ranking FUNCINPEC officials were targeted prior to Prince Ranariddh's return on March 30. General Thach Kim Sang was gunned down on a busy Phnom Penh street in broad daylight on March 4; Lt. Col. Moung Sameth was assassinated on March 3 in Kien Svay district near Phnom Penh, and Lt. Col. Chea Vutha, was killed on March 28 also in Kien Svay district. Local activists in the countryside were also targeted, as for example in the April 26 grenade attack against Son Sann Party members in Takeo, in which two people were killed.   In April the CPP turned its attention to getting its members appointed to the provincial and commune election commissions and launched a heavy-handed but generally nonviolent party recruitment campaign. Local officials and militia went house to house or conducted mass meetings to solicit thumbprints and pledges from the populace to vote for the CPP, confiscated and recorded identification numbers on voter registration cards, and conducted """"mock elections"""" before the actual polling, in which people were pressured to vote for the CPP. Although voter registration got off to a rocky start on May 18, the NEC reported that 92 percent of the estimated 5.6 million eligible voters eventually registered to vote.   Top opposition leaders such as Prince Ranariddh and Rainsy began to make high-profile visits to the provinces in May, but the ongoing threat of political violence discouraged activity by local-level opposition members outside Phnom Penh. A May 13, 1998 memorandum from the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Human Rights in Cambodia detailed forty-two killings and six long-term """"disappearances"""" of people presumed killed since the initial forty-one killings that took place in the immediate aftermath of the July 1997 coup. A U.N. report prepared in April concluded that the government had not launched any serious investigations into coup-related abuses and that no investigations were planned.   On June 8, the co-prime ministers signed a directive establishing a National Human Rights Committee. The fact that the committee was led by two top advisers to Hun Sen, and that this was the fourth time since July 1997 that Hun Sen had pledged to set up such a commission, did not inspire confidence that it was a serious effort. A National Task Force on Security for the Elections was established the same month, responsible for investigating election- related violence. Headed by National Police Chief Hok Lundy, himself linked to political murders, the task force concluded that all of the cases it received stemmed from personal motives such as revenge or robbery.   In the final two months preceding the elections the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights received more than four hundred allegations of voter intimidation, death threats, acts of violence against individuals, illegal arrests and detention, forced removal or destruction of party signs or shooting at party offices, coercion of voters to join the CPP, temporary confiscation of voter registration cards by local authorities, and barring of party members from access to communities. More than one hundred of the complaints were deemed credible.   In the elections themselves, 94 percent of the registered voters turned out to vote, observed by the Joint International Observation Group (JIOG), a U.N.-coordinated body of thirty-seven countries. The JIOG dispatched only 250 pairs of observers to cover more than 11,000 polling sites and 1,600 counting centers. Additional observation was handled by Cambodian observers under the auspices of well-respected electoral monitoring NGOs, such as the Committee for Free and Fair Elections (COMFREL) and the Coalition for Free and Fair Elections (COFFEL). Meanwhile, counting continued well into the third week in August.   The JIOG issued its assessment that the voting was free and fair on July 27, before the counting was even completed. The Asian Network for Free Elections (ANFREL) was the only international observer delegation to avoid making a snap judgment, calling on the NEC on July 30 to investigate complaints of polling and counting irregularities as well as reports of widespread intimidation and threats against opposition party members following the elections.   In preliminary results released by the NEC in August, the CPP was declared the winner, but the opposition rejected the results and demanded a recount. However, after cursory examination of only a fraction of the opposition's complaints, both the NEC and the Constitutional Council declared the appeals process closed. On September 1, the NEC announced the final results: the CPP received sixty-four of 122 National Assembly seats, or a slight majority, while FUNCINPEC got forty-three seats and the Sam Rainsy Party fifteen. The opposition refused to join a coalition government proposed by the CPP, which had not won enough seats for the two-thirds majority required to form the new government on its own. In late August the opposition launched three weeks of protest marches and rallies in Phnom Penh and set up a tent city in front of the National Assembly, which they called """"Democracy Square."""" Unprecedented numbers of people took to the streets to call for Hun Sen to step down. Government officials declared that the demonstrations were illegal and threatened to arrest Sam Rainsy.   Anti-Vietnamese sentiments flared in some of the demonstrations and rallies, with opposition politicians charging that Hun Sen and Vietnamese """"puppets"""" were intent on eliminating the Cambodian people. On August 30, demonstrators attempted to destroy a stone memorial in """"Democracy Square"""" that commemorates Cambodia-Vietnam friendship, smashing it with hammers and setting it on fire. On September 3 and 4, at least four ethnic Vietnamese were killed in mob violence in Phnom Penh as a result of rumors than more than seventy people had died from contaminated palm wine that had been poisoned by Vietnamese people.   Following a grenade attack on September 7 on Hun Sen's residence in Phnom Penh, government forces found a pretext to move against the demonstrators, opening fire outside the Cambodiana Hotel, where Sam Rainsy had taken refuge, killing one man and provoking widespread anger. Over the next week daily clashes broke out between riot police, pro-CPP demonstrators and opposition supporters. Bulldozers were brought in to destroy the tent city, and riot police used electric batons, fire hoses, rifle butts and bullets to disperse protesters around the city. At least two people were killed as a result of the unrest and human rights workers are investigating more than thirty suspicious deaths in and around Phnom Penh that occurred at the same time. Dozens more people, including monks, women, and students, were beaten or injured by government security forces, and more than twenty people were arrested. The government banned dozens of opposition politicians from leaving the country and threatened that some would be arrested.   Under intense pressure from the international community and King Sihanouk, the opposition called off the demonstrations and began to make accommodations with Hun Sen. On September 22, the king hosted a meeting in Siem Reap between Hun Sen, Prince Ranariddh, and Rainsy. This facilitated the swearing in of the new National Assembly on September 24.   Fundamental freedoms of association, assembly, and expression faced periodic threats during the year, although large numbers of people, sometimes tens of thousands, were able to gather for political rallies, labor demonstrations, and protest marches, and, for the most part, candidates were able to speak freely during the campaign. In the course of the crackdown on opposition supporters protesting the election results, however, the government issued a statement on September 9 that banned """"unauthorized gatherings,"""" particularly those that might disrupt public order and security.   Opposition parties had virtually no air time on broadcast media during the year, except for the thirty-day official campaign period, when NEC regulations provided for somewhat more equitable media access. Even during the campaign, however, the privately owned Apsara and Bayon stations continued to give disproportionate coverage in the first half of July to the CPP, which appeared 446 times, with FUNCINPEC appearing six times and the Sam Rainsy Party nine times. The court system remained virtually powerless in 1998, with the judiciary subject to political pressure. While no move was made against officials suspected of rights abuses, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan in August announced the creation of a Commission of Experts to assess evidence of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity committed by the Khmer Rouge under Pol Pot, who died on April 15, only days after the United States announced its intention to capture him and his top deputies and bring them to trial. Questions persisted as to the status of other ranking Khmer Rouge leaders who are still alive, including those who remain in hiding as well as more than a dozen influential Khmer Rouge who have defected to the government since 1996.","Asia, United States, Cambodia",""

The witness gave a coherent and credible account of the summary execution which was corroborated by the evidence found at the execution site and the testimony of another witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch on September 29. Human Rights Watch expressed serious concern today about the safety of the survivor in light of the Serbian police presence in the region, and called upon the international community to take the necessary steps to relocate this important witness to a safe location. Furthermore, the man has a severe and infected gunshot wound on his upper left leg, as well as gunshot wounds on his left arm, and is in need of immediate medical attention. """"The survivor is a credible witness to a summary execution, and the ability to bring the perpetrators of this serious war crime to justice hinges on his safety,"""" said Holly Cartner. """"The international community must take immediate steps to insure that he is safe and his testimony is preserved."""" During an interview today, he told Human Rights Watch that the inhabitants of his village Golubovac in the Drenica region of Kosovo had fled into the nearby forest on Friday morning after Yugoslav forces began shelling around the neighboring village of Cerovik. The villagers spent the night in the forest. According to the survivor, Serb police sent several elderly ethnic Albanian villagers who had remained in Golubovac to the forest on Saturday morning to tell the civilians taking shelter there that it was safe for them to return home. When they attempted to return, they were then gathered in a field by a group of about thirty or forty police officers, and the men were separated from the women and children. The police initially chose about twenty-five men from the larger group of men, but then narrowed this group down to fourteen men who, according to the survivor, would later be lined up and shot.  The survivor told Human Rights Watch that the fourteen were beaten with fists and rifles and kicked with boots while being questioned by Serb police about ties to the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). The process of separating the men and their subsequent interrogation lasted for about two hours. The men were then taken to the road next to the execution site, where they were forced to crouch with their hands behind their backs for an extended period of time. The survivor told Human Rights Watch that the men were then led into a garden and ordered to lie flat on the ground, face down with their hands behind their backs. They were told that if they identified KLA members in their midst everyone else would be freed. During this time, the survivor reported being beaten on his back with sticks and kicked all over his body. He showed Human Rights Watch deep bruises on his back and buttocks that were consistent with this account. He also described in detail how the men were executed, relating how a single police officer first executed the man lying next to the survivor and then two other men nearby. The police officer then moved up and down the column firing a burst of automatic gunshots at each victim. Several of the men were kicked afterwards and one man was shot again when he displayed signs of life. The witness apparently survived because he was able to feign death when being kicked. The police left the site almost immediately after the execution and the survivor was helped from the scene by local villagers. The testimony of the survivor was coherent and credible, and matched the testimony of an earlier witness previously interviewed by Human Rights Watch, as well as the evidence inspected at the execution site on Tuesday. Along a fence within a family compound, Human Rights Watch inspected many pools of fresh blood on Tuesday and found over eighty bullet shells at the spot where the witnesses claimed the policeman fired. The site was also visited by diplomatic observers on Tuesday. Human Rights Watch is greatly concerned about the health and safety of the sole survivor, who remains in the Drenica region, which is under heavy Serbian police control. Human Rights Watch calls upon the international community to assist the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in bringing the survivor to a safe location, and demands that the Yugoslav authorities and police and military forces refrain from any actions that would jeopardize the safety of this important witness.  The violations of humanitarian law being committed in Kosovo fall under the jurisdiction of the ICTY. By taking immediate steps to collect and preserve evidence and witnesses' testimony, the Tribunal will not only increase the chances of ultimately bringing the perpetrators to justice, but also of deterring future abuses. However, time is of the essence if the tribunal is to fulfill its enormous deterrence potential. Much more intense and timely attention to ongoing atrocities are required.  In order for the ICTY to meet this challenge, it must have sufficient capacity and equipment on site to conduct an immediate investigation when allegations of atrocities emerge. Further, its investigators, including forensic experts, must have unimpeded access to the sites of recent abuses. To date, the Yugoslav government has denied entry visas to forensic teams, investigators of the ICTY, and other respected and impartial international organizations in a blatant attempt to prevent international and independent scrutiny of the abuses committed by its forces.

Three deaths in three weeks is an alarming development,"""" said Allyson Collins, who tracks U.S. issues at Human Rights Watch. """"While agents are allowed to use necessary force to protect themselves and others, there are ways to minimize the use of deadly force. Protective gear should be issued to agents who patrol border areas and agents should have better training in when to use weapons,"""" said Collins. One of the shootings occurred near Imperial Beach, California; another near the San Ysidro port of entry in California; and the third near San Luis in Arizona. During the past week, there have also been non-fatal shootings by Border Patrol agents in more remote areas east of San Diego. And since early June, agents in southern Arizona reportedly have opened fire six times on border-crossers allegedly holding or throwing rocks. Although it is not clear from news reports how long the agents involved in the fatal shootings had been on the force, Human Rights Watch expressed concern over the Border Patrol’s hiring surge in recent years; the number of agents has grown from approximately 3,400 agents in 1993 to approximately 7,700 as of August 1998. """"Hiring pushes tend to overwhelm an agency’s ability to provide thorough screening, training or oversight of new recruits,"""" said Collins. Human Rights Watch called on the FBI, the Office of the Inspector General, the Border Patrol, and local officials to carry out thorough and prompt investigations into the fatalities and the other shootings. Since 1992, Human Rights Watch has researched human rights violations committed by U.S. Border Patrol agents and has written four reports on the subject, which are available by contacting 212-216-1832.","United States, Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Serbian police detained several hundred men during the attack on the convoy in Vranic. The men were then transported to the city of Prizren, where they were ill-treated in detention, according to some who were later released. Meanwhile, police burned large parts of the village of Vranic, and the shelling and burning of villages around Urosedac continued today, Human Rights Watch said. """"The Yugoslav authorities are carrying out an unrestrained campaign of terror against a civilian population,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. """"The atrocities committed by the Serbian police and the Yugoslav army are at the core of the humanitarian crisis in Kosovo and must be stopped immediately."""" Two of the four men killed were found on a hill overlooking the convoy site in Vranic and appeared to have been shot from a distance, possibly by sniper fire. Another two bodies were taken to the local mosque for burial by villagers. Miliam Bugari, age twenty-nine, had burn marks on his head that suggested he was executed at close range. Hafir Elshani, age thirty-five, was shot in the chest and his nose had been cut off. In Vranic, Human Rights Watch saw what remained of a convoy that stretched for approximately three kilometers. Cars, tractors and trucks were loaded with civilian possessions. A Human Rights Watch eyewitness counted thirty-four vehicles in the village that had been completely destroyed and another fifty-five vehicles that had been damaged to a lesser extent. In a river valley near Vranic, Human Rights Watch saw another 145 vehicles, about half of which were destroyed or severely damaged. The possessions of civilians were strewn around the site. Many of the vehicles had been burned.  According to eyewitnesses, the inhabitants of Vranic decided to evacuate their village on Sunday morning, September 27, after government forces began shelling the nearby villages of Bukosi and Budakovo and then began approaching the village of Vranic, where many persons from the region had sought refuge over the past two months. The civilians fled into the nearby forest above Vranic, where they spent Sunday night.  Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that the convoy was approached by an elderly man Monday morning who conveyed a message from the police that it was safe for them to return home. The convoy began returning to Vranic, but the first part of the convoy was stopped by police in the center of the village. Police then began screening all the civilians in the convoy. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that women and children were detained in a school compound in Vranic while the men were separated into two groups, one detained in a large house in Vranic and another taken to a school in nearby Bukosi. While the civilians were kept in detention, police started to burn houses in Vranic and destroy many of the cars in the convoy. According to eyewitnesses, the estimated 250 to 300 men detained in the house in Vranic were transferred to a fire station adjoining the police station in Prizren on Monday afternoon or Tuesday morning. Most were returned by police to Vranic around 3:00 p.m. today while Human Rights Watch was on the scene. The men detained in Bukosi were also released. The men who were returned from custody in Prizren told Human Rights Watch that they had been beaten by police with fists and rubber batons. They showed injuries that were consistent with their accounts, including swollen hands and bruises on the body. They also reported that they had not received any food or water since being detained. According to the released persons, approximately fifty people from the Vranic convoy remain in detention in Prizren.  While approaching the town of Vranic, Human Rights Watch saw the village of Budakovo burning in the background. According to local villagers and international monitors interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Budakovo was shelled on the morning of September 30 before police moved in to burn homes in the town.  Also on September 30, members of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) hit a landmine on a road outside of Libovac, injuring three ICRC staff and killing an ethnic Albanian doctor, Dr. Shpetim Robaj. Several other anti-tank mines were removed today from the area, which was also the location of two earlier mine explosions, one involving the Canadian-Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM) team and one that killed five Serbian policemen. Human Rights Watch called upon all parties to the conflict to refrain from the use of land mines.  Human Rights Watch urges the government of Yugoslavia to end all attacks on civilians immediately and to stop the widespread destruction of civilian property. In light of widespread and continuing evidence of torture and physical abuse in detention and at least five documented deaths in police custody in the past two months due to physical abuse, Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned about the treatment of those from Vranic who are currently detained in Prizren and calls upon the government of Yugoslavia to treat persons in custody humanely. Human Rights Watch also calls upon the government of Yugoslavia to allow international monitors such as the ICRC and human rights groups to have immediate and unconditional access to all detainees to monitor their treatment is custody.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

The massacre was clearly an attack on defenseless civilians who were hiding in the woods,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Yugoslav Army and Serbian Police are fighting a war against civilians, and this is another sad example of the unspeakable atrocities being committed against them."""" The Drenica region of Kosovo was considered a stronghold of the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA), and was the sight of similar civilian massacres in February and March 1998. Human Rights Watch has seen credible evidence of similar atrocities, including the recent summary execution of thirteen men, in nearby villages. Like thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the Deliaj family had sought refuge in the forest after their village, Donja Obrinja, was shelled during the recent Serbian offensive. Human Rights Watch saw seven bodies located approximately 1 kilometer outside Donja Obrinja in a forested area; eleven other bodies had been carried out of the massacre site and were in the process of being buried by local villagers and other family members. The corpses of five women and two children, aged five and seven, were lying in a narrow gully near a makeshift tent where villagers said the Deliaj family had sought refuge from the shelling. All of the victims had been shot in the head at close range, apparently while attempting to flee the attack. The bodies of several of the victims displayed clear evidence of mutilation.  Luljeta Deliaj, aged twenty-eight, was two months pregnant according to family members; her belly had been cut open. According to journalists at the scene, Pajazit Deliaj, aged sixty-five, was found in the makeshift tent with his throat cut open and part of his brain removed and placed next to him. Human Rights Watch later saw photographs of Pajazit Deliaj's corpse that clearly showed that his t hroat had been cut and his brain mutilated.  According to one eyewitness interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the Deliaj family had been living in the forest since September 25. On September 26, at 10:00 a.m., Serbian armed forces entered the forest on foot, according to the witness, who heard shooting and screaming coming from the area of the massacre.  According to the local villagers who were burying the bodies and a count of the graves by Human Rights Watch, a total of sixteen civilians were killed in the forest. At least two other civilians were killed in the nearby village of Donja Obrinja. Several others, including two teenage girls, remain missing.  In another village, Gornja Obrinja, Human Rights Watch found the corpses of three elderly civilians, including a woman and an invalid man, who had all been shot at close range, apparently not in connection with the attack on the Doliaj family. In other villages in the area, freshly dug graves could be observed. In the village of Golubovac, located approximately five kilometers south of Donja Obrinja, Human Rights Watch visited what appeared to be the execution site of fourteen young men, whom villagers said Serbian police had beaten and executed. The site was strewn with approximately eighty spent bullet casings, and Human Rights Watch observed fresh blood stains along the fence where villagers said the men had been executed. One man reportedly survived the execution, and was interviewed by Western diplomats touring the region today. According to eyewitnesses, police forced approximately two hundred villagers, who had been hiding in the nearby woods to escape shelling in their villages, to return to Golubovac on September 26. The eyewitnesses claimed that the police detained the group of two hundred civilians at a large house, and then selected the fourteen men for execution. One credible eyewitness told Human Rights Watch t hat the men were severely beaten and abused prior to execution. The southwestern part of Drenica has been the site of a major offensive by the Yugoslav army and Serbian police over the past week. Serbian police forces have systematically burned entire villages in the region. Food supplies have been systematically destroyed. Eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch described how they were forced to flee their villages when special police forces approac hed, and returned to find their homes burned and food supplies destroyed. The homes and villages inspected by Human Rights Watch often did not show any artillery or small arms marks and the evidence indicates that they were systematically burned while the villages were completely abandoned.  The targeting of civilians in war, summary executions, and the widespread destruction of civilian property constitute war crimes. Since the beginning of the Kosovo conflict in February 1998, the Yugoslav army and Serbian police have been implicated in many serious incidents of abuses against the majority ethnic Albanian population of Kosovo, suggesting a widespread disregard for the most basic pr inciples of the laws of war and international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch calls on the Yugoslav authorities to respect its international obligations, and to cease all attacks on civilians and the widespread destruction of civilian objects. Further, Human Rights Watch calls on the Yugoslav authorities to provide immediate access to the area to teams of independent forensic experts to carry out investigations. The international community must take imm ediate steps to end abuses against civilians in Kosovo, and work to bring the perpetrators of war crimes in Kosovo to justice.

In a letter to Clinton released today, Human Rights Watch called on the president to indicate that U.S. technical assistance in conducting elections, and the lifting of U.S. sanctions against Nigeria, including visa restrictions, will be conditional on progress in addressing human rights. The new transition program instituted by General Abubakar is clearly far more deserving of international engagement than the discredited Abacha program, the letter said. But Human Rights Watch shares the concerns of Nigerian human rights and prodemocracy groups that the military still exercises too much control over the process. """"Describing the new electoral commission as the 'Independent' National Electoral Commission, does not in itself guarantee independence,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/09/22/letter-us-president-clinton-ahead-meeting-nigerian-leader","Letter to US President Clinton Ahead of Meeting with Nigerian Leader","Letter to US President Clinton Ahead of Meeting with Nigerian Leader","","09/22/1998","Mr. President,   On the occasion of your meeting on September 23 with Nigerian head of state General Abdulsalami Abubakar, I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch to raise our concerns with you about the current situation in Nigeria, and to ask you to use the influence of the U.S. to improve respect for human rights in that country.   Human Rights Watch joins other observers in welcoming the steps taken by General Abubakar to restore respect for international standards of human rights since he took office following the death of General Sani Abacha in June. In particular, we note with appreciation the release of many political prisoners; the repeal of the decrees bringing the Abacha program into existence and dissolving the national executives of several unions; and the initiation of a fresh transition program under conditions that are substantially more open than those which prevailed during the failed transition of General Abacha.   Nevertheless, we continue to have serious concerns about respect for human rights in Nigeria, including the right to take part in genuine elections. Human Rights Watch believes that the international community should exercise caution before embracing new head of state General Abubakar, and set clear and stringent guidelines as to what is required for a credible transition program.   When you meet with General Abubakar, we urge you to raise with him the concerns we have outlined below. If they are not addressed, the losers in the scheduled elections may be reluctant to accept the results, possibly leading to the sort of chaos that preceded the annulment of the 1993 elections; in that case, this might enable those in the security forces who wish to reject a transition to civilian rule to intervene in the process and once again return Nigeria to military rule. Assuming that General Abubakar is sincere in his intentions to ensure a stable civilian government can take over, it is in his own interests to carry out further reforms. The U.S. should indicate that technical assistance in conducting the elections and the lifting of sanctions will be conditional on progress in addressing these points.   Reform of the Current Transition Program   While the new transition program instituted by General Abubakar is clearly far more inclusive than the discredited Abacha program, Human Rights Watch share the concerns of Nigerian human rights and prodemocracy groups that in many respects the process remains too closely controlled by the military. Describing the new electoral commission as the """"Independent"""" National Electoral Commission (INEC), does not in itself guarantee independence. An electoral commission should be seen to be completely impartial, yet at least three members of INEC have played prominent roles on a partisan basis in previous political processes. The military government has appointed the secretary to the commission and its regional commissioners, leaving it open to further manipulation. The provisions for registration of political parties, while certainly an improvement on previous versions, still impose serious financial constraints which will prevent many with a positive commitment to Nigeria's future from participating in the process.   We are also concerned at Abubakar's endorsement of the draft constitution of 1995, prepared by a constitutional assembly that was not elected under free and fair conditions. Moreover, although the constitution has finally been published, it is still not widely available for Nigerians to debate its content. In the meantime, the human rights provisions of the 1979 constitution remain largely suspended. Many of those who have been responsible for the widescale abuse of these rights remain in senior positions in the army and government, and should be brought to account for their actions.   Release of Remaining Political Prisoners   Although most high-profile political prisoners were released by General Abubakar during the weeks after he became head of state, several remain imprisoned. We urge you to raise the following cases with General Abubakar. Those still imprisoned should be released unconditionally, or released on bail, charged with recognisable criminal offences and brought to trial within a reasonable time before tribunals respecting international standards of due process.   Military personnel convicted after unfair trials before military tribunals of involvement in alleged coup plots in 1990, 1995, and 1997, as well as civilians such as Niran Malaolu, a journalist convicted of involvement in the 1997 coup plot, and Turner Ogburu, convicted in connection with the 1990 coup plot and still in detention despite court orders for his release.   Sheikh Ibrahim El Zak-Zaky, a radical Muslim leader, has entered his third year in detention, charged with publication of materials capable of undermining the security of the nation. Several associates are detained with him.   At least 163 executives of failed banks remain in detention without charge under decrees passed by the Abacha government, supposedly aimed at cleaning up the banking sector, though in practice it seems often targetted at possible political opponents. General Abubakar has promised to review these cases.   An unknown number of people remain in detention in connection with protests and demonstrations that took place, especially in the South West of Nigeria, following the deaths of General Abacha and Chief Abiola, and on Labour Day, May 1. There are also a large number of detainees who have been held without trial for varying periods in Ogoniland, where the Rivers State Internal Security Task Force is still deployed despite longstanding calls from human rights groups in Nigeria and internationally for it to be withdrawn, and in other parts of the oil producing communities of the Niger Delta.   A number of close advisers of General Abacha were detained following his death, in connection with allegations of massive theft of government funds; they too deserve a fair trial before the normal criminal courts if they are suspected of committing criminal offences.   Repeal of Repressive Decrees   It is essential that General Abubakar repeal the many repressive decrees allowing detention without trial, suspending constitutional guarantees of human rights, setting up special tribunals to try particular offences, and barring the courts from considering executive acts.   Among the most important of these decrees are the State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree No. 2 of 1984, permitting indefinite detention on security grounds; the Constitution (Suspension and Modification) Decree 107 of 1993, which, when read with other decrees, suspends the human rights protections in the 1979 constitution, and prohibits the courts from reviewing military decrees; and the Treason and Other Offences (Special Military Tribunal) Decree No.1 of 1986 and the Treasonable Offences Decree No.29 of 1993, under which the alleged coup-plotters of 1995 and 1997 were tried, which define treason widely and provide for trial before tribunals which do not respect international standards of due process. There are countless others which should also be repealed or amended.   Respect for Freedom of Expression, Association, and Assembly   Respect for the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly is crucial to a credible political process. Parties and candidates must be able to campaign and hold rallies freely, and journalists must be able to comment on the process without fear of harassment. While respect for these rights has improved since the death of General Abacha, we urge you to call on General Abubakar to repeal decrees restricting freedom of expression and of the press, including the Offensive Publications (Proscription) Decree and the Newspapers Decree, both of 1993. The draft 1995 constitution also includes provision for a """"mass media commission"""" to regulate the media, raising concerns about the possibility of future restrictions on critical reporting. This concern must also be addressed.   Police have also warned on several occasions that the Public Order Act requiring a police permit to hold a demonstration is still in effect. Rallies held after Abacha's death and in protest at the death of Chief Abiola were broken up by police, and tens of people arrested, who remain in detention. Recently five people demonstrating in support of Muslim leader El Zak-Zaky were reportedly shot dead by police in Kaduna. Several decrees restricting the right to organize remain in force. Such restrictions must be lifted for the transition program to be credible.   Thank you for your attention.

The organizers had also planned to hold a conference Monday on human rights in Tunisia at the office of the Moroccan Bar Association. Human rights activists had arrived from Paris, Cairo, and elsewhere to participate. A representative of the independent Moroccan Association for Human Rights (Association Marocaine des droits de l’Homme, AMDH), one of the sponsoring organizations, said that organizers had applied for permission to hold the march. He said they had not sought permission for the meeting at the bar association offices because private gatherings in private quarters required no prior authorization.  But before the day’s events, organizers received a letter from authorities informing them that the march and meeting could not take place as planned due to unspecified security considerations. A large contingent of police surrounded the downtown offices of the bar association on Monday and prevented access to it.  The meeting was relocated to an AMDH office in Rabat, where it was allowed to take place while police were stationed outside. An AMDH representative pointed out, however, that the association’s office was smaller than the bar association office and that some persons stayed away because of the police action that day.  Organizers of the events included the Cairo-based Arab Program for Human Rights Activists, the Paris-based Arab Human Rights Committee, the AMDH and the Ligue Marocaine de Défense des Droits de l’Homme. Khemais Ksila, a vice-president of the independent Tunisian League for Human Rights, is serving a three-year sentence in a Tunis prison for charges that include incitement and defamation of the public order. The charges stem solely from a public statement Mr. Ksila issued on September 29, 1997 criticizing President Ben Ali for human rights abuses and heavy repression.

The conference is reviewing the 1996 Wassenaar Arrangement, an international agreement signed by 30 countries to govern the proliferation of military technology.  Dissidents and human rights organizations under repressive regimes frequently use encryption technologies to share information. Encryption has the power to authenticate the identity of these authors to their partners abroad, while protecting their identity from despots at home.  The United States has adopted relatively restrictive encryption policies, which prohibit the global dsitribution of software used to encrypt text. In particular, Washington has outlawed the export of the most popular software among human rights activists, Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), although the Wassenaar Arrangement explicitly exempts crypto-software, like PGP, that is widely available in the public domain.  Human Rights Watch warned the other participants in the Vienna conference not to incorporate such restrictive policies into the Wassenaar Arrangement, or to further limit the global distribution, development, or use of strong encryption hardware or software.  """"Encryption is more than a shield for human rights activists,"""" said Jagdish Parikh, associate online researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"Coded language is still language, and it must be protected as a basic human right to free expression."""" Parikh noted that the right to free expression is set forth in Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which most members of Wassenaar Arrangement are party.  Human Rights Watch said that encryption is also an important bulwark against violations of privacy in an age where computerization and data banks enable the collection of huge amounts of personal information about individuals. Moreover, international law requires states not only to refrain from arbitrary interference with privacy, but to affirmatively protect its citizens from such attacks.  """"The sorts of countries most eager to ban the use of encryption, such as China and Iran, are not known for respecting freedom of speech,"""" said Parikh.

Some of the serious human rights violations in Iran include:  Prominent dissidents, including writers and editors, continue to be subjected to arbitrary detention and restrictions on their freedom of expression. On September 16, Hamid Reza Jalei-Pour, Mohammad Javadi-Hessar, Mashalla Shamsol-va-Ezin, who are two managers and the editor of a daily newspaper, were arrested by an Islamic revolutionary court for publishing articles against the national """"security and general interests.""""  The former Deputy Prime Minister, Abbas Amir Entezam was detained on September 8, 1998 following public statements critical of the treatment of political prisoners. He has been denied access to his lawyer. An independent religious scholar, Hojatoleslam Mohssen Saeidzadeh, was detained in June 1998, apparently because of his public criticism of laws relating to the status of women in the family. He has not been able to challenge the legal basis for his detention before a court, and he has been denied access to his lawyer. Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, the former designated successor to Ayatollah Khomeini as Leader of the Islamic republic, and other senior clerics, such as Ayatollah Azari Qomi, have been constrained from expressing their views, which are critical of the present government. Ayatollah Montazeri is reported to be under house arrest in his residence in Qom. Several of Ayatollah Montazeri's followers, including his son-in-law, Hadi Hashmei, Abolfazl Musavian and Gholam-Hossein Nadi are in prison for their views. Increasing numbers of dissident clerics are being prosecuted by Special Courts for the Clergy, where clerics are persecuted for their ideas in proceedings which fall far short of international standards.  The government has repeatedly failed to take steps to halt violent attacks by vigilante groups known as the Ansar-e Hezbollah. These groups serve as enforcers for the conservative clerics, and they have targetednewspaper offices, non-violent demonstrators, and prominent activists. After two government officials -- a minister and a vice president -- were attacked and beaten by these mobs in September, President Khatami finally called for the arrest of the perpetrators. However, no details have been released about whether those responsible are being brought to justice. The situation of religious minorities continues to be a cause for concern. On July 21, 1998 Ruhollah Rowhani was executed in the city of Mashad on charges of converting a Muslim to the Baha'i faith. The trial took place in secret. This is the first execution of a Baha'i since 1992 and marks a deterioration in the situation of this intensely persecuted religious minority. At least fifteen other Baha'is are currently in prison, seven are believed to have been sentenced to death for their faith. Sunni Muslims have also been persecuted. In June, Molavi Imam Bakhsh Narouie, the prayer leader of a Sunni mosque, was killed in the town of Miyankang, in Sistan va Baluchestan Province. Local Sunnis believe that the government killed him, although there is no hard evidence to support that assertion. In May, a 60-year-old Jewish businessman, Ruhollah Kadkhoda-Zadeh was arrested, and later hanged in prison. Several Jewish Iranians have been arrested for spying for Israel in the past, but in this case, the authorities never declared his crime. A month after his arrest, they handed over his body to his family, with an order to bury him without any religious ceremony.  Torture continues to be widespread during the investigation phase of criminal prosecutions. In March, more than 150 deputies in the Iranian parliament called for an investigation into allegations that police tortured Tehran city officials during their detention. The city officials, including several district chiefs, were arrested over the course of several months last year, as part of an investigation into financial corruption in the municipality and its mayor, Gholam Hossein Karbaschi. President Khatami has ordered a review of these credible torture allegations, but this has yet to be carried out. In an open challenge to the more open climate of debate, in July the parliament passed a law outlawing """"encouraging conflict between men and women by promoting rights outside the norms of the Shari'a.""""The legislation clearly targeted activists who have been campaigning for reform in laws which discriminate against women, and fail to protect the best interests of children. Conservative forces opposing the more open debates in the media have used the vaguely-worded press law to shut down newspapers. Several newspapers, including Panshambeha, Gorzaresh-Ruz, Jameh, Khaneh, Tous, and Rah-e No have been closed, at least temporarily, in the last three months. The government continues to obstruct access to the country for international human rights monitors, including the UN Special Representative, Mr. Maurice Copithorne. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly been denied permission to visit the country. Independent domestic human rights monitoring is severely restricted, making the work of international monitors especially important.  President Mohammed Khatami of Iran is scheduled to visit the United Nations next week. On the occasion of this newsworthy trip, Human Rights Watch has prepared the following backgrounder on the domestic situation in Iran. We also attach a recent press release on the Shi'a minority in Afghanistan, which may draw Iran into armed conflict outside its borders.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran","Religious Freedom, United Nations"

President Robinson, who visited China from September 6-14, said that she had:  raised the cases of individual dissidents.  cited problems of torture and arbitrary detention and encouraged greater cooperation between the U.N. and the Chinese government in addressing these issues.  asked about the status of the Panchen Lama, the nine-year old child not seen since May 1995 when he was formally recognized by the Dalai Lama as the reincarnation of the second highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism.  received assurances that China would sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in October.  She also spoke publicly about the linkage between economic development and respect for basic freedoms and signed an agreement for technical cooperation on human rights.   """"President Robinson was walking a tightrope on this visit, trying to engage the Chinese government on human rights without downplaying the extent or gravity of abuses,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch in New York. """"It's far too early to tell whether she succeeded. The test will be not whether she gets invited back, but whether China does indeed provide access to the Panchen Lama, release more prisoners, cooperate more with the U.N. human rights experts such as the Special Rapporteur on Torture, and ratify the major U.N. treaties on human rights.""""   China's promise to sign the ICCPR in October was useful, Jones said, but China would only be legally bound by the treaty's provisions after ratification. (The United States signed the treaty in 1977 but the U.S. Congress did not ratify it until 1992.) Also, Ms. Robinson gave no indication today whether she had brought up China's intention to attach """"reservations"""" to the convention, by which a country can take exception to key provisions dealing, for example, with the right of free expression.   """"We are puzzled as to why the U.N. Commissioner declared she was satisfied that China was committed to international standards, when its record on compliance with existing U.N. standards is so poor,"""" said Ms. Jones. """"She also said, however, that implementation and follow-up are crucial, and on that point we couldn't agree more.""""   Human Rights Watch gave Ms. Robinson credit for refusing to go on a showcase tour of a prison in Tibet during her visit to Lhasa on September 10-11, and for asking to see a prominent dissident monk and former political prisoner, Yulo Dawa Tsering. Chinese officials refused to comply with the request. On the other hand, Robinson declined to meet with any dissidents or family members of political prisoners while in China, despite their repeated attempts to see her, and this was clearly a missed opportunity. Chu Hailan, wife of imprisoned labor rights activist Liu Nianchun, was detained and beaten when she tried to see Robinson in Beijing on September 9.   Jones said she hoped that President Robinson would make any follow-up visits contingent on access to China by key U.N. human rights experts, and on clear and concrete steps by the Chinese government to implement the provisions of the treaties it has signed or promised to sign. """"The first visit can be aimed at establishing a relationship,"""" said Jones. """"The second must be aimed at results."""" Jones said the need for concrete measures was particularly important since the European Union, U.S., and other governments dropped any resolution on China at the Commission in Geneva this past April in exchange in part for China's agreement to have Robinson visit.","Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"

Roth urged the U.S. government not only to support a search of the factory for signs of the production or storage of chemicals related to nerve agents, but also to use this opportunity to broaden the scope of a chemical weapons inspection to other sites in Sudan. Roth also asked the U.S. to disclose information it used to determine if the factory was an appropriate military target. """"Did the U.S. really do everything it could to determine that this factory was a legitimate military target?"""" said Roth. """"Unless they start declassifying some of that information, doubts will persist."""" Roth noted that under U.S. law, a legitimate military target must be shown to be serving a military purpose at the time of the attack. The soil sample cited by U.S. government officials showed only that Empta had been present months before the attack. The human rights organization asked that the U.S. compensate the civilians injured and the relatives of the person killed in the attack. Such compensation can be made without any concession that the U.S. acted improperly.

While we acknowledge the burdens faced by the Montenegrin government in responding to this crisis, closing the border effectively traps people who are fleeing continued fighting and wide spread atrocities by Yugoslav government forces,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. On September 11, 1998, in a late evening session the Montenegrin government decided to close the internal boundary between Montenegro and Kosovo to all persons seeking refuge from the armed conflict. The government justified its decision based on the economic strain posed by the incoming displaced persons and its fear that new arrivals would increase ethnic tensions and possibly destabilize the country. At the time of the decision, approximately 40,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo had taken refuge in Montenegro. Combined with an additional 30,000 refugees who had fled the war in Bosnia and Croatia, refugees and displaced persons in Montenegro comprise 11.6 percent of the total Montenegrin population, according to the government. As a result of the swelling refugee population in Montenegro, xenophobia and ethnic tension are on the rise. On September 13, a group of 3,200 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo were expelled to Albania by the Montenegrin authorities. Two-thirds of those expelled were women, children, and the elderly, according to humanitarian sources. They arrived in Montenegro on September 11, and were kept on the outskirts of the town of Plav until their expulsion on September 13. The government of Montenegro has pledged to provide safe harbor to the refugees and internally displaced persons who arrived on its territory prior to the September 11 decision.  Since March 1998, the Yugoslav government offensive in Kosovo, accompanied by systematic atrocities and human rights violations, has forced at least 300,000 people to flee their homes. Many are currently in exposed conditions inside Kosovo facing ongoing attacks. An estimated 80,000 people have fled Kosovo for neighboring republic of Montenegro, and the neighboring countries of Albania and Macedonia. Human Rights Watch is concerned that these territories, if forced to rely only on their own resources, will not have adequate means to receive refugees and displaced persons in conditions that ensure their health and well-being.  Despite many promises, western governments have not provided sufficient aid to Montenegro in responding to its refugee crisis. """"To date, the international community has not mustered the resolve to force an end to the fighting in Kosovo, fighting that on a daily basis produces new waves of displacement and suffering.

Clinton The White House Washington, DC 20500   Dear President Clinton,   We are writing to urge you to give full U.S. government support for a United Nations inspection of the site of the bombed al Shifa Pharmaceutical factory in Khartoum for signs of the production or storage of chemicals related to the nerve agent VX. The U.S. government should use this opportunity to broaden the scope of a chemical weapons inspection beyond a single plant and seek inspection of other suspected sites of materials relating to chemical weapons in Sudan. We also urge the U.S. to disclose information it used to determine that the factory was an appropriate military target, and to reveal what consideration was given to warning civilians in or near the facility of the impending attack. Finally, as a humanitarian matter, we ask that the U.S. compensate the civilians injured and the relatives of the person killed. This compensation may be made without any concession that U.S. conduct was improper.   Human Rights Watch condemns the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania which led to the deaths of hundreds, and injuries to thousands, of Africans and Americans. Those responsible should be brought to justice, and accorded full rights to a fair trial so there remains no doubt of their guilt.   In Human Rights Watch's 1996 report, Behind the Red Line: Political Repression in Sudan, we condemned the gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in the fifteen-year-long civil war in Sudan. In our August 1998 report, Global Trade, Local Impact: Arms Transfers to All Sides in the Civil War in Sudan, we called for an international arms embargo on both the government of Sudan and Sudanese rebels on account of these violations.   For almost two decades Human Rights Watch has examined whether the rules of war, or international humanitarian law, have been followed in the conduct of wars around the globe. We do not examine the legality of the reasons for going to war, and we do not take sides in military conflicts, in order to maintain a neutral posture vis-a-vis the conduct of all parties in the course of a conflict.   Inspection Human Rights Watch has urged the Sudanese government to sign and accede to the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention - steps that might allay the world's concerns about Sudan's chemical capacity by permitting regular inspections. In our report, Arms Transfers to All Sides in the Civil War in Sudan, we refer to allegations by Sudanese opposition National Democratic Alliance sources that Sudan has stored chemical weapons for Iraq at the Yarmouk Military Manufacturing Complex, located in Sheggera, twelve kilometers south of Khartoum, and that Sudan established a special committee in early 1995 to investigate the possibility of manufacturing chemical weapons.   Although we were unable to reach any conclusion as to the Sudanese government's actual possession, manufacture, or use of chemical weapons, we remain vitally interested in its chemical weapons capacity not only for the threat it poses to non-Sudanese, but also because we are concerned that, if it had such capacity, the government of Sudan might employ chemical weapons in its current war against its own citizens.   During our investigation into possible Sudanese chemical weapons capacity, we met with Dr. Mustafa Osman Ismail in November 1997 in Khartoum; he was then deputy minister and is now minister of external relations. He denied all allegations regarding chemical weapons in Sudan and told our representative, """"Anybody who wants to come and check on whether we have chemical weapons can do so, including a United Nations technical mission. But they would have to make a clear declaration at the end that there is nothing there.""""   It is therefore with dismay that we learned that the U.S. government is resisting a proposal to send U.N. chemical weapons investigators to Sudan to examine the al Shifa factory. This is inconsistent with U.S. support for such inspections in Iraq and with U.S. concern about the proliferation of chemical weapons and terrorism in general. Instead, it suggests that the U.S. government itself has something to hide. We urge the U.S. government to accept the inspection and to ask the Security Council to take advantage of the Sudanese government's desire for this inspection by asking for simultaneous inspection of other Sudanese locations believed to house chemical weapons or their precursors. The inspections should be conducted by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the U.N. agency charged with monitoring the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Such an opportunity for inspection may not present itself again for a long time.   Legitimate Military Targets We have long denounced the Sudanese government's bombing of civilians and civilian objects in its war in southern and eastern Sudan and in the Nuba Mountains. For example, we have testimony of eyewitnesses describing how the Sudanese government bombed a hospital in Yei in rebel-held southern Sudan in March 1998, killing seven and injuring many more. There are many other reports of illegal bombing by the Sudanese government. We note that if the Sudanese government were to apply to its ongoing bombing campaign the standards it seeks to apply to the U.S. government, Sudanese civilians living in the war zones would be spared enormous suffering and death.   We are committed to holding all who engage in military actions in Sudan to the same international standards we apply to the government of Sudan and Sudanese rebel forces. We thus urge you to order the release of information necessary to establish that these standards were respected.   The U.S. Navy, which conducted the bombing of the al Shifa plant, already accepts and incorporates into its rules all relevant provisions of international humanitarian law that appear in the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and their First Additional Protocol of 1977. These appear in its Annotated Supplement to the Commander's Handbook on the Law of Naval Operations (""""Naval Handbook""""). This Handbook and the international law it reflects are the standards we apply in examining the target selection process engaged in prior to the August 20 bombing of the al Shifa plant in Khartoum.   Section 8.1.1 of the Naval Handbook states: """"Proper economic targets for naval attack include . . . industrial installations producing war-fighting products . . . ."""" It also defines military objectives as those objects which, by their nature, location, purpose, or use, effectively contribute to the enemy's war-fighting or war-sustaining capability and whose total or partial destruction, capture, or neutralization would constitute a definite military advantage to the attacker under the circumstances at the time of the attack.   A leading authority states that the requirement of a """"definite military advantage . . . under the circumstances at the time of the attack"""" imposes a time limitation on those who select military targets. It recognizes that in the dynamic circumstances of armed conflict, """"objects which may have been military objectives yesterday, may no longer be such today and vice versa. Thus, timely and reliable information of the military situation is an important element in the selection of targets for attack."""" (Michael Bothe et al, New Rules for Victims of Armed Conflicts (Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, Boston; 1982, p. 326) Another authority states that those planning an attack will have to determine whether, say, the destruction of a particular bridge, which would have been militarily important yesterday, does, in the circumstances ruling today, still offer a """"definite military advantage"""": if not, the bridge no longer constitutes a military objective and, thus, may not be destroyed. (Frits Kalshoven, """"Reaffirmation and Development of International Humanitarian Law Applicable in Armed Conflicts: The Diplomatic Conference, Geneva, 1974-77,"""" 9 Netherlands Yearbook of International Law 107, 111 (1978).)   The Naval Handbook accepts the principles set forth in Protocol I, article 57 (2) regarding precautions to be taken by those planning or deciding on attacks to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. (Naval Handbook, Section 8.1.2.1.) Protocol I, article 57 (2) provides that those who plan or decide upon an attack shall do everything feasible to verify that the objectives to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection but are military objectives within the meaning of paragraph 2 of Article 52 and that it is not prohibited by the provisions of this Protocol to attack them.   The requirement to do """"everything feasible"""" to verify that the target selected is a military objective involves """"a continuing obligation to assign a high priority to the collection, collation, evaluation and dissemination of timely target intelligence."""" (New Rules, p. 363)   It has not yet been established by the evidence in the public domain that the U.S. military planners did everything """"feasible"""" to establish that the al Shifa factory met the definition of a legitimate military target, or even that it was a legitimate military target at the time of the attack. According to U.S. government statements, a soil sample taken at the factory was found to contain Empta, a chemical used in the manufacture of the deadly nerve gas VX. There have also been references made to contacts between plant personnel and Iraqi officials believed to have the technical knowledge to produce chemical weapons.   But the U.S. government has not explained why its investigation of the site was sufficiently diligent in light of the fact that U.S. officials now admit that they did not know the plant manufactured legitimate pharmaceuticals. The evidence these officials cite for their belief that the plant had no legitimate civilian purpose - unlike the web sites of other known pharmaceutical manufacturers in Sudan, this company's web site did not mention any products - is hardly conclusive. As is now known, the al Shifa factory did in fact produce and sell pharmaceuticals under its name in Khartoum. Why was sufficient investigation not done to learn this before the attack? We recognize that a plant producing legitimate goods may at the same time be producing prohibited chemical substances. But that the planners did not know about the factory's legitimate activities suggests a lack of diligence in intelligence gathering. These and other facts raise serious concern in the minds of many about the thoroughness of the target-selection process. The U.S. government should attempt to ease these concerns by providing further elaboration of the diligence of its pre-bombing investigation of the plant.   Moreover, the U.S. government's disclosure that a soil sample taken months before the attack contained Empta shows only that this chemical had been present in the past, not that it continued to be present. The soil sample would have been compatible, for example, with the past, discontinued storage of Empta, or the past production of Empta, and does not necessarily suggest that the plant continued to store or produce the chemical. The law requires that for a target to be legitimate it must be serving a military purpose """"at the time of the attack."""" The U.S. government should disclose whatever additional information it has to suggest that the factory remained involved in some way with Empta at the time the attack was launched. It would also be useful in this regard to disclose any prior conversations that U.S. officials had with the Sudanese government about its involvement in the production or storage of chemical weapons.   Warning The duty when possible to warn noncombatants of an impending attack is set forth in Section 8.5.2 of the Naval Handbook:   Where the military situation permits, commanders should make every reasonable effort to warn the civilian population located in close proximity to a military objective targeted for bombardment. Warnings may be general rather than specific warnings lest the bombarding force or the success of its mission be placed in jeopardy.   It seems clear from statements you made, Mr. President, on August 28 and at other times, that consideration was given to the possibility that Sudanese civilians might be in the area bombed, and that you wanted to avoid injuring them. We believe the public is entitled to know whether consideration was given to the feasibility of warning civilians, and if that alternative was rejected, the reasons for its rejection.   It would seem that a mere phone call fifteen minutes in advance might have given the Sudanese civilians enough time to evacuate the area. Given the type of weapons employed by the U.S. Navy, it would seem that this might have been done with no risk to U.S. personnel or to the success of the mission.   Compensation In light of your stated concern with civilian injures, it would be entirely appropriate as a humanitarian matter for the U.S. government to compensate those Sudanese injured and the survivors of the civilian killed in the bombing. There is already precedent for the U.S. to compensate civilians injured in a U.S. military attack without any concession of negligence or culpability. The U.S. provided compensation to the families of the persons on an Iranian civilian airliner mistakenly shot down over the Persian Gulf, even though an internal U.S. investigation established that its forces did not act negligently. In Sudan, also, the U.S. should compensate civilians who for no fault of their own were injured in the U.S. military strike.   Famine Finally, we wish to draw your attention once more to the famine gripping southern Sudan, where the U.N. estimates that 2.4 million people are at risk of starvation. Unfortunately for this devastated population, the U.S. bombing has had the unintended effect of leading to a disruption in assistance. For instance, all U.N. agencies based in Khartoum have evacuated their American staff, as have many other relief organizations. As a result, many relief efforts have been postponed indefinitely, including a crucial one run by the U.S.-based International Rescue Committee in the government garrison town of Wau in southern Sudan, where more than fifty southerners are dying daily. We urge you to remain mindful of this terrible crisis as you continue to assess U.S. policy in Sudan.   Sincerely,   Kenneth Roth Executive Director","Africa, Sudan",""

Aid workers in Pakistan say that thousands of Hazaras were killed when the Taliban took the northern city of Mazar-e Sharif last month.   Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Security Council, which has already expressed deep concern about the human rights situation in Afghanistan, to launch a formal investigation into the killings in Mazar-e Sharif, with the aim of setting up a tribunal if appropriate.  """"The outside world has for too long ignored the crisis in Afghanistan,"""" said Patricia Gossman, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"Meanwhile, Afghanistan's neighbors have kept the war going. Intervention by the U.N. now might help insure that one day the victims obtain justice and the cycle of violence is slowed, if not stopped."""" The U.N. should also initiate urgent talks with the Taliban to post human rights observers on the ground in Hazarajat, Gossman said. She noted that since the U.S. airstrikes in Afghanistan last month, all foreign aid workers have been evacuated, leaving no witnesses to the war. Human Rights Watch further called on the United States and the European Union to urge the International Monetary Fund to bear in mind Pakistan's role in providing military support to the Taliban as the agency considers a planned economic rescue package for Pakistan. Pakistan should also condemn the killings and investigate the role Pakistani fighters may have played in the massacres, Gossman said. Western diplomats, UN officials, and Western aid workers say thousands of Hazaras, mostly males, were killed in front of their families in Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of the anti-Taliban alliance in northern Afghanistan, when the Taliban captured the city last month. According to aid workers, young men over 16 had their throats slit, while younger boys and women had both hands chopped off at the wrist.  These attacks on the Hazaras have the potential of igniting a wider war. Iran has long backed the Hazara militia, Hezb-e Wahdat, while Pakistan has supported the Taliban. A senior Taliban official has confirmed that nine of the eleven Iranian diplomats nationals missing since the city of Mazar-e Sharif fell to Taliban forces last month were killed. A number of Pakistanis, including members of the extremist Sunni organization Sipah-i-Sahaba, reportedly fought with the Taliban in Mazar-e Sharif. The Taliban is now poised to move further into the central enclave of Hazarajat, a region populated almost exclusively by Hazaras, and home now to many displaced Hazaras who fled Mazar-e Sharif during the Taliban offensive. According to press reports, the Taliban are closing in on the region from three sides and have already taken several towns. The region's capital city, Bamiyan, is surrounded on all four sides by the Taliban. Since 1997 the Taliban have enforced a blockade on the Hazarajat region, preventing food and other humanitarian assistance from reaching there from the south, while anarchical conditions in the north blocked access from the other direction. The blockade was only lifted temporarily in May of this year.  The Hazaras, a Shi'ite Muslim minority which has suffered a history of discrimination in Afghanistan, have been targeted by the Taliban since the militia began its military campaign four years ago. With few exceptions, the Taliban come from the Pashtun ethnic group that dominates the predominantly rural areas of southeastern Afghanistan and western Pakistan. The Hazaras' Shia faith is anathema to the Taliban, which is seeking to impose its version of a Sunni Muslim theocracy in Afghanistan. The Taliban has jailed Hazara refugees returning from Iran. Among those fleeing the current fighting, Hazaras have been stopped and taken away for questioning.  The enmity also has its roots in the cycles of revenge killings that have marked Afghanistan's civil war: The Hazara militia Hezb-I Wahdat was responsible for atrocities against Pashtuns before the Taliban took Kabul, and may have been involved in the massacre of some 2000 Taliban soldiers during a failed attempt by the Taliban to take Mazar-e Sharif in May 1997. The U.N. promised to investigate the massacre but failed to do so. If a tribunal is established, those killings should also come under its purview.  The Taliban has denied responsibility for the killings but has refused to allow aid workers, the UN, or foreign journalists to return to Mazar-e Sharif","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The latest victim, Nuh Khalil `Abdallah Nuh, twenty-three, died two days after his arrest on July 19. Human Rights Watch called on Bahrain to appoint an independent procecutor to investigate allegations of torture and deaths in custody, and to take steps to guarantee freedom of expression and association. Bahrain announced last month that it would allow a visit by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and reconsider its reservation to Article 20 of the Convention against Torture -- thereby allowing the Committee against Torture to conduct confidential investigations into allegations of torture in Bahrain. """"We applaud the government’s recognition that torture and arbitrary detention are a problem in Bahrain,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. """"But Bahraini citizens shouldn’t have to die before the government is willing to act."""" Megally urged Bahrain to quickly make its declaration in favor of Article 20, and to set a date for a Working Group visit. Megally was also critical of steps Bahrain has taken this year to increase already severe restrictions on the right to freedom of association, and in particular to stifle the activities of the Bahraini Lawyers’ Society.  """"The Lawyers’ Society was perhaps the last place in Bahrain where people could come together to talk about the problems facing that country,"""" Megally said. """"If Bahrain’s lawyers are intimidated into silence, what hope is there for ordinary citizens to speak their minds?"""" Fatchett’s visit comes only days before a September 16 court hearing on the appeal of the elected board of the Lawyers Society against their forced replacement by government supporters. Details on deaths in detention, actions taken against the Lawyers’ Society, and Human Rights Watch’s recommendations to the Bahraini government are summarized below. Deaths in Custody Human Rights Watch has received reports of at least seven deaths due to the torture, mistreatment or medical neglect of detainees in Bahrain since the unrest began in December 1994.  The most recent victim, Nuh Khalil `Abdallah Nuh, twenty-three, was reported to be in good health when he was detained in the al-Na`im district of Manama by members of Bahrain’s security forces on July 19, 1998. When his body was returned to his family on July 21, it reportedly bore marks indicating Mr. Nuh had been tortured while in custody.  Other recent cases include Sheikh `Ali al-Nachas, a blind Shi'a cleric about fifty years old, who died on June 29, 1997 in al-Qal`a Prison in Manama, where he had been held incommunicado since his arrest on April 23, 1997; `Abd al-Zahra Ibrahim `Abdullah, twenty-seven, who died on June 6, 1997, five days after his arrest during clashes with security forces in the village of Sanabis; and Bashir Abdallah Ahmad Fadhil, whose body was returned to his family for burial on May 18, 1997, two days after his arrest during an assault by security forces in the village of Daih. Eyewitnesses to the arrests of `Abdullah and Fadhil reported that both men were beaten at the time of their arrests. Tightening restrictions on freedom of association: the Lawyers’ Society Despite the guarantee of freedom of association in Bahrain’s constitution, Legislative Decree 21 of 1989 includes a broadly-worded provision, Article 18, which prohibits organizations from engaging in politics, in violation of the internationally recognized right of persons to engage in peaceful political activity and participate in public affairs. The Lawyers’ Society until recently appeared to be exempt from this blanket prohibition, and regularly held """"internal events,"""" to which it invited non-lawyers. In late January 1998, the society sponsored a meeting on """"The Tehran Conference, The Doha Conference, and Their Repercussions for the Region."""" After the meeting security forces reportedly interrogated the society’s staff about who attended and spoke, and the ministers of justice and interior separately questioned Lawyers’ Society president Abbas Hilal about the meeting. On February 28, Minister of Labor and Social Affairs `Abd al-Nabi al-Shu`ala dismissed the society’s elected administrative board and canceled a general assembly meeting scheduled for March 19, at which new elections were to be held. That same day the minister issued Decree 4 of 1998, charging the society with being in violation of Article 18 of Decree 21/1989, and appointing a new board charged with presenting recommendations for reforming the society. The decree provided for an automatic one-year extension of the term of the appointed board if new elections are not held within its first eleven months.  More than seventy members of the society filed a legal challenge to the government’s action, which will be heard on September 16 before a special court headed by Sheikh Khalifa bin Rashid Al Khalifa, the head of the State Security Court. The minister of labor has reportedly met with lawyers leading the court challenge to press them to drop the appeal, to agree to seek permission for all society activities, including internal meetings, three months in advance, and to refrain from any participation in politics. The lawyers were also instructed to remain silent about these meetings. Despite repeated requests by Human Rights Watch, Bahraini government has yet to make public any evidence to substantiate the charge that the Lawyers’ Society is in violation of Decree 21/89 or any other laws or decrees governing its activities, or to clarify what activities it considered to be serious enough breaches of the law as to require the removal of the elected board less than three weeks before already scheduled general elections. Recommendations In light of the worsening situation with respect to freedom of association and continued reports of deaths in custody, torture, and mistreatment of detainees, Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Bahrain to take the following steps: Appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate deaths alleged to have occurred at the hands of the security forces, as well as acts of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment alleged to have been committed by officers of the Special Investigation Service, the Criminal Investigation Directorate, and the Public Security Force. Such a prosecutor should be empowered to report publicly on the findings of the investigation, and to bring charges against any officials implicated as responsible for ordering, carrying out, or tolerating acts of torture or acts resulting in wrongful death. Amend those laws and decrees that unduly restrict the ability of citizens to exercise the right to free speech and to freedom of association, such as Article 18 of Legislative Decree 21/1989, to bring them into compliance with international human rights standards. Immediately halt all efforts to undermine the Lawyers’ Society, or to interfere with its conducting its legitimate activities as a legal professional association","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United Kingdom, Bahrain",""

With its own detention facilities overwhelmed, the INS is placing its administrative detainees in jails, even though they are not serving criminal sentences. Those detained include asylum seekers, undocumented individuals picked up by the INS on the street or during workplace raids, and individuals with previous convictions who are now awaiting deportation.  """"The INS is shipping immigrants off to local jails where they don't belong,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"This practice violates international standards, and it must stop.""""  The 84-page report, Locked Away: Immigration Detainees in Local Jails in the United States, reflects research conducted over an eighteen-month period, including visits to fourteen jails in seven states and interviews with more than 200 INS detainees. Human Rights Watch has also received hundreds of letters and scores of telephone calls from detainees describing poor conditions and mistreatment in jails around the country. The seven states visited are: Florida, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Texas, and Virginia.  Detainees report problems ranging from bad or insufficient food to more dramatic charges, such as the July 1998 incident in which guards at the Jackson County Correctional Facility in Florida allegedly used electrified batons and shields to shock detainees. Among other abuses identified in the report are: the denial of appropriate medical care; frequent, unexplained transfers to other jails; lack of outdoor exercise; correctional officers without language or other skills necessary to deal with an INS detainee population; excessive or inappropriate discipline; commingling with accused or criminal inmates, and isolation from family and friends through restrictive telephone, correspondence, and visitation policies. Immigration detainees, whether held in INS detention facilities or in local jails, have a right to legal counsel, yet holding them in jails makes it more difficult for them to obtain legal assistance. """"The INS has abdicated responsibility for people under its care,"""" said Roth. At an average cost of $58 per day per detainee, the INS spends nearly a half-million dollars each day to house its detainees in local jails. This arrangement provides a source of profit for county governments; in some, county debts have been paid and some taxes eliminated due to revenue from holding immigrants in local jails. Roth noted that immigration detainees who cannot be deported, because neither their own country nor any third country will accept them, are effectively serving an open-ended criminal sentence. Immigrants from countries such as Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Iraq, and Iran may be held for years without resolution of their cases; Human Rights Watch interviewed several detainees who had been held for three years or longer and had no idea when, or if, they would be released or deported. Asylum seekers are protected by international refugee law and deserve special treatment. They are usually victims fleeing abusive governments, but under the care of the INS, they face a new kind of abuse. Because the INS's detention records do not indicate which detainees are asylum seekers, they are simply mixed with other INS detainees and local jail populations. """"In most cases, the INS should not be detaining these people at all, much less in jails,"""" said Roth. """"But they should certainly never be held in remote facilities, where they can't get access to legal counsel or psychological counseling services.""""  Among the report's recommendations: Detention facilities used by the INS should reflect the non-accused, non-criminal status of all INS detainees. Therefore, the INS should not house its detainees in local jails, prisons, or any other facilities intended to hold criminal populations.  Asylum seekers, as a general rule, should not be detained. The right to seek and enjoy asylum is a basic human right; individuals must never be punished for seeking asylum in the United States. Given the shortage of detention space readily available to the INS and the tremendous human and financial costs of contracting with local jails, non-custodial alternatives to detention should be explored before any decision to detain an individual is final. The INS must implement detention standards immediately and must require that any jail with which it contracts meets the treatment and condition requirements. The standards should be promulgated as federal regulations. All decisions to detain immigrants should be automatically and promptly referred for review to a judicial or other competent authority. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division should investigate complaints of poor treatment and conditions of confinement of INS detainees in local jails. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should continue to revise and strengthen its Guidelines on the Detention of Asylum Seekers.","United States","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Amir-Entezam was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1979 on charges of spying for the United States after a trial which fell far short of international standards of fairness. In 1996 he was released from prison and his life sentence was suspended. As a long serving political prisoner in Iran, Amir-Entezam witnessed mass executions and other gross violations of human rights. He had spoken out frequently in the foreign press, criticizing those violations. On September 8, 1998, Amir-Entezam was detained at his home in Tehran following an interrogation earlier that day at court. The written summons cites """"defamatory statements"""" he allegedly made about the former director of Iranian prisons, Assadollah Lajevardi, who was assassinated on August 23. Following the death of Mr. Lajevardi, Amir Entezam publicly condemned prison conditions and the treatment of prisoners in Iran during the period Lajevardi was in charge. On September 9, the court ordered Amir-Entezam's release from detention, but when his wife went to meet him at Tehran's Evin prison, she was told that the previously suspended life imprisonment sentence was now being reinforced. No further explanation was given for Amir-Entezam's continuing detention and he has not been permitted to meet with his lawyer. """"Amir-Entezam is being punished for his statements exposing harsh conditions in Iranian prisons and the widespread use of torture,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.

According to the NLD, the arrest of democracy supporters began in the capital of Rangoon in the late hours of Sunday evening, September 6, and continued through Monday and Tuesday in provincial areas as well. As yet, no charges have been reported against those detained, and the party's leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, has not so far been detained. Human Rights Watch has also received reports that elected members of parliament from smaller ethnic nationality parties have also been detained.  The latest round of arrests heralds a major new clampdown by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) which could lead to the eventual banning of the NLD altogether. Lt-Gen. Khin Nyunt of the SPDC last month labelled the NLD as """"obstructionists with evil intentions"""". Human Rights Watch called on Japan, the European Union and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), whose foreign ministers are due to meet in New York on September 23-24, to condemn the arrests and urge Burma to take concrete steps as recommended by the U.N. this past April, including """"all appropriate measures to allow all citizens to participate freely in the political process...and to permit them to participate in a meaningful process of national reconciliation."""" """"We urge the Burmese government to comply fully with the recommendations of the United Nations by releasing immediately and unconditionally all those detained for political reasons, and to stop the harassment of the NLD,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Increased repression will only create continued instability and lead to Burma's further isolation internationally."""" The present crackdown comes at a time of deteriorating conditions within the country. Intermittent student demonstrations in Rangoon have been broken up by riot police over the past two weeks, while tight restrictions on freedom of association and movement are being enforced on NLD officials as well as foreign visitors and journalists. During August, over 20 foreigners were reported to have been deported for their contacts or sympathies with pro-democracy groups within Burma. However, the trigger for the present arrests appears to have been the NLD's call to convene a """"people's parliament"""" in line with the 1990 election results. An NLD deadline of August 21 for the convening of the parliament was allowed to pass by the military government. But by making such sweeping arrests now, the SPDC is clearly attempting to prevent the NLD and democratic ethnic minority parties from holding any large-scale gatherings. Just last month the state-controlled media announced several times that the SPDC was willing to talk to the NLD; at the SPDC's invitation, two meetings were held between senior government officials and NLD leaders, including NLD party chairman U Aung Shwe. However, at the month's end, the SPDC appeared to close the door to further meetings, and in particular to Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Human Rights Watch is also concerned that a threatening commentary in the state-controlled media today called for her deportation from Burma for """"sedition"""" and representing foreign interests.  Human Rights Watch urged the SPDC to release the 220 who have been arrested as well as all other NLD supporters and ethnic minority politicians who have been detained for their membership of political parties or for peaceful expression of their political beliefs. In addition, the SPDC should lift all restrictions on freedom of association and movement, in particular those which inhibit the functioning of democratic parties. Any attempt by the SPDC to ban the NLD or other democratic parties would represent a serious escalation in the political crisis within Burma. In particular, the threat to deport Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is a grave attack on individual human rights and must immediately be removed.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

In a new report titled """"The Damaging Debate On Rapes of Ethnic Chinese Women,"""" the organization said the debate raging on whether or not rapes had occurred was obscuring other issues, including the extent to which the May rioting was organized, the fact that sexual violence other than rape occurred, and the need to make Indonesia a society where people of all ethnicities felt secure. The government statements are based on the fact that to date, not a single victim of the May rapes has reported an attack to the police, despite reports of rights advocates that more than 100 rapes took place. Advocates say the women in question are traumatized by the assaults themselves and subsequent intimidation, and, in some cases, have fled the country. Officials accuse nongovernmental groups of fabricating their data. Human Rights Watch said those accusations would only serve to further discourage any witness from giving testimony to a government-appointed fact-finding board.  """"If it was difficult to persuade victims, their families, or their doctors to come forward before, it's going to be almost impossible now,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Who would want to testify, thinking no one was going to believe them anyway?"""" The Human Rights Watch report notes that ethnic Chinese women have many reasons for not going to the police, including a long history in Indonesia of police extortion of ethnic Chinese and a widespread belief that security forces were involved in the May violence. It also notes that reports of rape of women in Aceh, in nothern Sumatra, during military operations there in 1990-91 are only now coming out now, seven years or more after they took place. Human Rights Watch acknowledges that there have been problems with some of the data collected because of the chaotic circumstances in which reports came in but said rights groups were doing additional verification and going back, where possible, to the original source. It said that once verification was complete, the numbers would probably drop below the figures initially reported. The organization stressed, however, that the key issue was not numbers, but how and why violence occurred and how it can be prevented in the future. It also called on the Indonesian government to invite the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women to visit Indonesia to meet with officials and rights advocates and explore these issues further.","Asia, Indonesia","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

The new report, """"Academic Freedom in Indonesia: Dismantling Soeharto-Era Barriers,"""" is a study of the legal and institutional mechanisms used by the Soeharto government to silence campus critics, arbitrarily limit public debate on pressing social issues, and stymie intellectual inquiry. According to the report, most of those controls are still in place. """"If there is to be lasting reform in Indonesia, the government must confront Soeharto's authoritarian legacy head on, and this is the place to begin,"""" said Human Rights Watch researcher Joseph Saunders. Although the New Order government was not uniformly hostile to the academic community, it was always suspicious of students and academics. The social role of the university as a center of inquiry and debate made it an important target of military and government controls. Noting the eruption of long-suppressed voices since Soeharto's resignation, Mr. Saunders cautioned: """"There was a similar opening during the last political transition in Indonesia in the late 1960s, but it didn't last because it wasn't followed by legal and institutional change. Our goal in releasing this report is to encourage the government to do things differently this time."""" The militarization of Indonesian society under Soeharto had devastating consequences for free inquiry and expression. The report calls for an end to military intervention in campus affairs, including intelligence gathering on campus, the use of campus-based """"Student Regiments"""" to monitor and intimidate other students, and indiscriminate and punitive attacks on student demonstrators. It urges continued investigation into the military's role in the abduction, torture, and possible murder of student activists earlier this year and calls on the government to punish to the full extent of the law military officers found responsible for the abductions. The report also calls for formal repeal of ministerial decrees known collectively as """"Normalization of Campus Life -- Coordinating Body for Student Affairs"""" (Normalisasi Kehidupan Kampus -- Badan Koordinasi Kemahasiswaan or NKK/BKK) and all other decrees that prohibit students from expressing political views on campus, forbid autonomous student organizations, or make university administrators answerable to military authorities for enforcement of political controls. With the success of the student protest movement in 1998, these controls now have little practical effect, and Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia's new minister of education, has indicated that they are under review. The report urges that they be abolished altogether. A number of continuing ideological and institutional controls in Indonesia date back to the rise of Soeharto to power in 1965-66, when an estimated one-half million people were killed in anti-communist pogroms. The report urges repeal of so-called """"Special Investigation"""" (Penelitian Khusus or Litsus) regulations which require that new teachers and entrants to a range of other strategic professions undergo mandatory ideological and political background checks to determine if they are """"tainted"""" by political affiliations that they or members of their extended family had over thirty years ago. The report also calls for an end to controls that impede national reexamination of the events of the mid-1960s, including censorship of memoirs, literary works, and a wide range of foreign and domestic studies. A handful of previously banned books have been allowed to circulate by the Habibie government, but hundreds of other works are still banned and regulations giving the government broad powers to censor books and other printed materials remain in place. Although the new government has released a number of political prisoners, existing laws and long-established institutional practices continue to give authorities the power to imprison or censor individuals who express dissenting views. The report calls for repeal of laws often used by Soeharto to silence dissidents, including student and faculty critics: Presidential Decree 11/1963 (subversion); Article 154 of the Criminal Code (spreading hatred toward the government); and Articles 134-137 (insulting the head of state). It also urges the Social and Political Affairs Directorate in the Ministry of Home Affairs to end the practice of blacklisting government critics from attending seminars and appearing in major media, and calls for abolition of research permit procedures that give government and military officials effective veto power over proposed academic field research.  The recommendations of Human Rights Watch reflect its analysis of seven continuing barriers to free inquiry and expression in Indonesia, set forth in separate chapters of the report. The report also includes a discussion of academic freedom as a global human rights concern, and a long background chapter that both outlines the history of campus controls under Soeharto and details the rise of the nationwide student protest movement that earlier this year successfully pressured Soeharto to resign. The historical survey shows the far-reaching impact that crackdowns on the academic community have had in limiting the free flow of information and ideas in Indonesia. As Mr. Saunders emphasized, however, """"the Indonesian example also shows that the academic community's principled resistance to authoritarian controls can help open the door to democratic reform.""""","Asia, Indonesia",""

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) found former mayor, Jean-Paul Akayesu, guilty of nine counts of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The verdict is the first handed down by the Rwanda Tribunal; the first conviction for genocide by an international court; the first time an international court has punished sexual violence in a civil war; and the first time that rape was found to be an act of genocide to destroy a group. Rape is a serious war crime like any other,"""" said Regan Ralph, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division. """"That's always been true on paper, but now international courts are finally acting on it."""" The Rwanda Tribunal was initially reluctant to indict Akayesu for rape. When Akayesu was first charged in 1996, the twelve counts in his indictment did not include sexual violence — despite the fact that Human Rights Watch, and other rights groups, had documented widespread rape during the genocide, particularly in his area. A lack of political will among some high-ranking tribunal officials as well as faulty investigative methodology by some investigative and prosecutorial staff of the Rwanda Tribunal accounted for this omission initially.  During the Rwandan genocide, thousands of women were targeted by Hutu militia and soldiers of the former government Armed Forces of Rwanda on their genocidal rampage. Tutsi women were individually raped, gang-raped, raped with objects such as sharp sticks or gun barrels, held in sexual slavery or sexually mutilated. These crimes were frequently part of a pattern in which Tutsi women were subjected to sexual violence after they had witnessed the torture and killings of their relatives and the looting and destruction of their homes. Under pressure from Rwandan and international rights groups, the Office of the Prosecutor finally amended the charges against Akayesu to include sexual violence in June 1997. During the Akayesu trial Rwandan women testified that they had been subjected to repeated collective rape by militia in and around the commune office, including in view of Akayesu. They spoke of witnessing other women being gang-raped and murdered while Akayesu stood by, reportedly saying to the rapists at one point """"don't complain to me now that you don't know what a Tutsi woman tastes like.""""  International criminal law has always encompassed crimes of sexual violence: rape can be a violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, the 1948 Genocide Convention, the 1984 Torture Convention, and a crime against humanity under the Nuremberg Charter. After World War II, the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg established rape as a crime against humanity, but did not actually prosecute it. The Military Tribunal for the Far East (the Tokyo Tribunal) did convict Japanese officers of rape. Despite these legal precedents, rape has long been mischaracterized and dismissed by military and political leaders as a private crime, the ignoble act of the occasional soldier. Worse still, it has been accepted precisely because it is so commonplace. Longstanding discriminatory attitudes have viewed crimes against women as incidental or less serious violations.  Since 1990, some progress has been made. Both the two International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda have brought sexual violence charges. The Yugoslav tribunal brought twenty-seven initial indictments that included charges for rape and sexual violence. Of those charged, fifteen are at large, six are in custody, two are deceased, three have had the charges withdrawn and one was found guilty of other charges. The Rwanda Tribunal has brought two initial indictments for sexual violence (one of which was today's Akayesu case) and an indictment for murder where sexual violence was used to kill women. In July of this year, a treaty creating a permanent International Criminal Court expressly named crimes based on sexual violence as part of the court's jurisdiction.  Human Rights Watch today urged the Rwanda Tribunal to indict more suspects for crimes of sexual violence. Hundreds of thousands of women were raped during the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The Rwanda Tribunal must more thoroughly integrate this issue into its prosecutorial and investigative strategies and provide better witness protection programs so women can testify without fear of reprisal.

International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) will issue a historic judgment in the case of Jean-Paul Akayesu, who is charged with genocide, crimes against humanity and crimes committed in an internal armed conflict. The Coalition on Women's Human Rights in Conflict Situations, which includes Rwandan and international women's rights groups, expects that the Akayesu case will set a milestone in the prosecution of crimes of sexual violence committed in armed conflict.     Akayesu, former mayor of the Taba commune, was accused of allowing police and others under his authority to rape and torture mostly Tutsi women who had sought his protection. With a guilty verdict, this would represent the first time anyone has been found liable by an international tribunal for genocide crimes which include sexual violence. As well, Akayesu would be the first non-military leader declared guilty for rape crimes committed in an internal armed conflict.     Initially, the ICTR had not charged Akayesu with sexual violence crimes despite overwhelming evidence of mass rapes in the Taba commune. In 1997, testimony emerged from his trial about Akayesu's prominent role in the rapes.     On the basis of this testimony, and on facts collected in Human Rights Watch's 1996 report """"Shattered Lives"""", the Coalition submitted an """"amicus curiae"""" brief to the ICTR, urging the Tribunal to bring charges of rape and other crimes of sexual violence against Akayesu. This brief is an official part of the Akayesu case file.     In June 1997, the Prosecutor amended the Akayesu indictment to include charges of sexual violence. Since the submission of the amicus brief, the Coalition has continued working to encourage the Office of the Prosecutor to adequately prosecute crimes of sexual violence at the ICTR by urging adequate witness protection, proper training for ICTR investigators, the addition of more women on investigating teams, and other measures.     The Rwanda Tribunal deserves credit for the strides it has made since its inception. Thirty-five defendants have been charged and sexual violence indictments have been brought in two of those cases.

The Secretary is expected to leave for Europe on Saturday, for stops in Croatia and Bosnia, before traveling on to meet President Clinton in Moscow for the summit meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.  August 28, 1998 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20520 Re: Trip to Croatia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Russia Dear Secretary Albright: I am writing to you regarding your upcoming trip to Europe, including stops in Croatia, Bosnia, and Russia, all countries in which we have serious concerns about human rights conditions. We strongly urge you to emphasize these concerns, summarized below, in your meetings with relevant government officials. CROATIA Human Rights Watch is troubled by the on-going discrimination suffered by Serbs in Croatia. In a recent mission to Croatia, Human Rights Watch documented persistent discrimination against Serbs, especially legal and administrative difficulties that leave them without the documents, pensions, and housing to which they are entitled. The reintegration of Eastern Slavonia can only be viewed as a disaster in terms of protection. So-called """"soft evictions"""" of displaced Croatian Serbs from their current residences in Eastern Slavonia by Croat returnees--through intimidation, legal and administrative discrimination, threats and periodic violence--have reduced the number of displaced Serbs in Eastern Slavonia from 60,000-70,000 in 1996 to approximately 5,000 today. Most have left for Yugoslavia, Bosnia and third countries, rather than returning to their pre-war homes elsewhere in Croatia, in part because unevenly applied housing laws leave them unable to reclaim their pre-war homes now occupied by Croats. As for long-term Serb residents of Eastern Slavonia, """"For Sale"""" signs on houses are now a common sight in Serb villages, as they too try to leave with their families for Yugoslavia. Meanwhile, a number of obstacles prevent the return of Croatian Serb refugees from Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Croatia. Throughout Croatia, Serb returnees often face a hostile welcome and sometimes violence from their neighbors, especially Croat refugees from Bosnia. Moreover, current Croatian reconstruction law prioritizes reconstruction of property damaged by Serb """"aggression"""" and the homes of """"homeland defenders,"""" while Serbs receive only limited assistance in property reconstruction from international non-governmental organizations and other donors. The lack of suitable housing and difficulties in obtaining passports and documents proving citizenship at Croatian consulates abroad, coupled with widespread uncertainty about the Croatian amnesty law and high-profile war crimes trials being conducted in Croatia, remain serious obstacles to the return of Croatian Serbs. Under international pressure, Croatia recently took measures to facilitate return of Serb refugees and displaced persons to their pre-war homes: they adopted a program on return and repealed several discriminatory housing laws. We cautiously welcome these developments, but remain concerned that without sustained international monitoring and pressure, implementation will fall far short of Croatia's international commitments. For example, the Croatian government has so far failed to issue instructions on the functioning of the local housing commissions set up under the new program to facilitate the return of occupied property to its original owners. Against this backdrop, we believe that your trip to Croatia is an important opportunity to impress upon the Croatian authorities that the international community will hold it to its human rights commitments. We would also encourage you, when you meet with your European colleagues in Vienna, to request them to make the human rights situation in Croatia a priority, particularly in connection with the upcoming six-month review of the E.U.'s regional approach to reconstruction assistance for the former Yugoslavia. In addition to the foregoing concerns about discrimination suffered by ethnic Serbs in Croatia, Human Rights Watch is deeply disturbed about reports that the Croatian government may be connected to the disappearance of an indicted war crimes suspect and possible key witness against his former commanders. The Croatian weekly Nacional reported in January 1998 that Bosnian Croat and/or Croatian authorities have been involved in the disappearance of Miroslav Bralo, a Bosnian Croat who is under sealed indictment by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Miroslav Bralo, according to The Washington Post (December 9, 1997), tried to hand himself over to SFOR troops in Vitez on July 14, 1997, and was willing to cooperate with the Tribunal. However, he was turned away by the SFOR troops, who apparently did not know he was indicted. According to the story in Nacional, Miroslav Bralo was kidnaped by Croat secret police in December 1997, only days before Dutch SFOR troops in Vitez arrested two other indictees. U.S. government sources have confirmed that Bralo is no longer in Bosnia, and indicated that he might be in Croatia. Human Rights Watch believes his disappearance may be connected to his willingness to testify against his former commanders, Anto Furundzija and General Tihomir Blaskic, and is very concerned about his safety. We understand that U.S. embassy officials in Zagreb are investigating this matter, but we strongly urge you to raise the question of Miroslav Bralo's whereabouts with Croatian officials as well. BOSNIA AND HERCEGOVINA Since the signing of the Dayton Agreement in late 1995, and particularly since July of last year, significant improvements have taken place regarding rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, and democratization in Bosnia and Hercegovina: Freedom of movement considerably improved after the authorities from both Entities agreed on new registration plates in January 1998, and many more people cross the Inter-Entity Boundary Line than was the case during the immediate post-war period. The ICTY has many more indictees in custody than a year ago, though few of these apprehensions can be attributed to cooperation by the Bosnian authorities. The joint political institutions have begun to meet regularly, albeit with many difficulties, and only after extensive pressure by the international community. On many key issues, including the flag, the coat of arms, the new currency, and privatization laws, the High Representative ultimately had to make a decision himself, due to the inability of local authorities to come to an agreement. The process of reform and restructuring of the police force is well underway in the Federation, and a modest beginning has been made in the Republika Srpska (RS). The RS government of Prime Minister Dodik has shown much more willingness to cooperate with the international community than its predecessor, which was under the control of Radovan Karadzic. While these developments are significant, what is most notable is the extent to which they have been imposed on the authorities of Bosnia and Hercegovina by the international community. Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about the authorities' persistent disrespect for fundamental human rights, which is undermining all western efforts at reconstruction and peace-building. A number of our key concerns are outlined below: Cooperation with the ICTY While many more indictees are in custody in The Hague than was the case a year ago, this is only to a limited extent the result of cooperation by the authorities in Bosnia and Hercegovina. For the most part, indictees have decided themselves to surrender, or were detained by SFOR troops. In no case has an indictee been arrested and turned over to The Hague by national, entity or local officials. Indeed, there are numerous examples of governmental authorities' ongoing obstruction of such arrests. It was only after intense and sustained pressure by the international community that the Republic of Croatia handed over ten Bosnian Croat indictees to the ICTY in October 1997. The Federation authorities, in this case the Bosnian Croats, did nothing to arrest or detain these indictees, although they had been living in areas under their control. At the present time, at least two other publicly indicted persons, Ivica Rajic and Zoran Marinic, are believed to be living in Bosnian Croat territory. Yet, the local authorities have taken no steps to arrest them. After much delay, the local authorities in Republika Srpska finally allowed the ICTY to open an office in Banja Luka. However, no further cooperation has been forthcoming. The RS authorities have yet to arrest a single person indicted by the ICTY, despite their legal obligations to do so. Moreover, Louise Arbour, the Chief Prosecutor of the ICTY, stated recently that """"Republika Srpska [...] has [...] been engaged in deliberately frustrating the Tribunal's work by issuing false identification papers to those persons indicted by the Tribunal in an attempt to shield them from the Tribunal's jurisdiction."""" Rule of law, impunity and the role of the police and the judiciary The impunity enjoyed by prominent war crimes suspects reverberates throughout Bosnian government and society. Ethnically motivated violence, including homicide, continues to occur throughout Bosnia and Hercegovina. Over the last year, ethnically motivated attacks occurred in, among others, Travnik, Drvar, Vares, Jajce, Mostar, Derventa, Doboj, Bugojno, Bijeljina, Janja, Sarajevo and Banja Luka. In most of these cases, the perpetrators have never been brought to justice. Often, this is the result of an unwillingness on behalf of the local police or judiciary: many of the investigations into, and court proceedings of, these incidents are fundamentally flawed. Moreover, in several of these incidents, the local police played a very dubious role: they often made no attempt to prevent these incidents from happening or to react to them once they were underway and, in some cases, the police were even actively involved in these incidents. IPTF reports on Drvar, Teslic, Jajce, Mostar, Stolac and other places provide ample evidence to prove this. During violent demonstrations in Jajce in August 1997, the reaction of the local police was at best non-existent. On several occasions, police officers were observed standing by without intervening, and in one case seven police officers refused to take action to remove a roadblock (despite being asked to do so by IPTF) and instead retreated from the scene. During the violent demonstration in Drvar in April 1998, local police were observed walking in the crowd, without any attempt to control the crowd. Furthermore, a police officer from Bosansko Grahovo encouraged a crowd to block an SFOR vehicle from moving, and even put a log in front of the vehicle. Indicted persons and others who are believed to have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the war continue to exert control over parts of Bosnia and Hercegovina. Their ongoing influence is one of the greatest obstacles to Bosnia's development into a democratic, pluralistic state where human rights and fundamental freedoms are respected. Not only do these persons obstruct the implementation of important human rights provisions of the Dayton Agreement, they also prevent other more moderate leaders from fulfilling their international obligations. RS Prime Minister Dodik's limited success at implementing the Dayton Agreement can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that he still does not exert real control over Eastern Republika Srpska, which remains under the influence of Radovan Karadzic and his supporters. The arrest of Radovan Karadzic, Ratko Mladic and other individuals indicted by the ICTY is necessary for long-term peace in Bosnia, as well as any successful western """"exit strategy"""" for the country. Return of refugees Closely related to on-going ethnic violence, inadequate policing, and the pervasive lack of respect for the rule of law is the slow pace of refugee return to Bosnia and Hercegovina. The international community in Bosnia and Hercegovina has declared 1998 to be the Year of Return. However, with some notable exceptions, the pace of returns remains extremely slow, and those that do take place are mainly returns to so-called """"majority areas."""" The latest UNHCR figures show that, between the signing of the Dayton Agreement and June 30, 1998, around 475,000 displaced persons and refugees have returned (out of over 2 million displaced persons and refugees). However, of those 475,000 returnees, only about 15,000 were returns to the Entity where the returnee is now a """"minority."""" And even including the return of Muslims to Croat areas of the Federation and vice versa, """"minority returns"""" only constitute 11% of all returns. The """"Open City"""" program was created by UNHCR to encourage minority return by financially rewarding municipalities that allow minority groups to return to their former homes. In order to be awarded the status of Open City by UNHCR, municipalities have to meet a set of basic criteria that are proof of genuine commitment to minority return. While the Open Cities program can be called a success in some areas, in places like Vogosca and Konjic it has failed. In Vogosca, one of the first municipalities to receive Open City status, there has been virtually no return: only 26 Bosnian Croats and 46 Bosnian Serbs have returned this year, and UNHCR is considering revoking the Open City status. And as the International Crisis Group pointed out in its report """"The Konjic Conundrum,"""" there have been fewer than 300 minority returns to Konjic, despite the fact Konjic, according to UNHCR, is a """"model Open City."""" Although other factors--such as lack of housing and willingness to actually return--play an important role, obstruction by local authorities is a significant factor as well. Authorities continue to obstruct return in several ways. In Sarajevo, they have consistently failed to meet targets and deadlines set by the Sarajevo Declaration, the final document of a February 1998 conference on return to Sarajevo. These targets and deadlines concern a variety of issues, such as the identification of cases of multiple occupancy, resolution of all pending UNHCR and Jewish community cases, revision of school curriculums and police reform. According to the second Sarajevo Declaration Quarterly Implementation Review, the Sarajevo authorities have verified only 148 addresses of multiple occupancy, whereas the target for June 30, 1998 was the identification of 1500 addresses. Furthermore, of the 98 pending UNHCR return cases, only 36 have been resolved, and of the 29 Jewish community return cases, only 16 have been resolved. But the lack of progress is most obvious when we look at actual return: whereas the target for 1998 was to have 20,000 members of minority groups return to their prewar homes in Sarajevo, as of June 30, 1998, only 423 Bosnian Croats and 575 Bosnian Serbs had returned. Republika Srpska Prime Minister Dodik promised to allow 70,000 Bosniaks and Croats to return to the RS during 1998. However, despite assurances given during the April 1998 Banja Luka Regional Returns Conference, the RS authorities failed to meet the June deadline set by the Conference for revocation of discriminatory property housing legislation. Now, the Peace Implementation Council (PIC), at its meeting in Luxemburg, has set a new deadline: August 31, 1998. Moreover, as of this writing, the RS authorities have still not presented a comprehensive return plan for the RS. The government's failure to create even these minimum conditions for return make it improbable that there will be any significant return to the RS this year: by the time new laws and a comprehensive return plan are adopted and ready for implementation, the """"return season"""" will be almost over. As of June 30, 1998, only 1,920 members of minority groups had returned to the Republika Srpska since the signing of the Dayton Agreement. Furthermore, there are still hundreds of cases of so-called """"floaters"""" (ethnic minorities who were expelled from their homes after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, but who, nevertheless, remain in the same city). There has been little progress on these cases, despite repeated demands from the international community to allow these people to return to their property immediately. Moreover, some who have tried to return to their homes have been prevented--often violently--from doing so. Violent incidents, often believed to be orchestrated by the local authorities and police have occurred in both Entities. The incidents in Drvar and Doboj in April 1998, and the ongoing obstruction of return in Stolac, are the best known, but certainly not the only, examples of obstruction to return. In Drvar, a series of violent incidents, ranging from arson of houses of (potential) returnees to the killing of an elderly Serb couple that had just returned, have taken place. Tensions culminated in a violent demonstration on April 24, 1998, in which the municipality building and offices of several international organizations were attacked, ransacked and set on fire, and in which Mile Marceta, the Serb Mayor of Drvar, was seriously injured. The incident led hundreds of Serbs, who had just returned to Drvar, to leave again. On April 26, 1998, a violent clash in Svjetlica, a village in the vicinity of Doboj (RS) between Serbs and Bosniak returnees resulted in at least five Bosnian Serbs being injured by a hand grenade. The implementation of the pilot project for return of Bosniaks to Stolac has been hampered by an endless series of incidents of intimidation, harassment, and violence against Bosniak returnees. Moreover, many houses of (potential) Bosniak returnees have been destroyed by explosions or have been set on fire. Implementation of local election results We understand that a primary purpose of your trip is to emphasize the importance the U.S. places on the conduct of free and fair elections next month. Accordingly, we would like to highlight a number of on-going problems relating to the implementation of last year's local elections. The results of the local elections have been implemented in almost all municipalities, albeit in many cases only after a long and difficult process of negotiations, and often with considerable pressure by the international community. However, the municipal councillors of Srebrenica have failed to come to an agreement on the constitution of municipal bodies. Before the war, Srebrenica had a clear Bosniak majority (72.9% according to the 1991 census). Since the fall of Srebrenica in 1995, the town has been inhabited exclusively by Serbs, many of whom are displaced persons from Sarajevo and Bosnian Krajina. In the 1997 municipal elections, however, the Coalition for a United and Democratic Bosnia, a coalition of Bosniak political parties, won 24 seats in the Srebrenica Municipal Assembly, while the Serb Democratic Party and the Serb Radical Party together won the other 20 seats. Since the councillors could not agree on the constitution of municipal bodies, the OSCE appointed an interim Executive Board, headed by an OSCE representative (Mr. Larry Sampler). But according to sources in the OSCE, even the members of the appointed Executive Board refuse to meet each other. In the other municipalities, the election results have been formally certified, and municipal bodies have been elected, but such bodies often do not function properly, as a result of the inability of opposing ethnic groups to agree on any topic. In several municipalities, representatives of post-war ethnic minority groups only have a symbolic role, without any substantial influence in the municipality. This is especially the case in municipalities where the post-war ethnic minority only has a relatively small number of seats. Even elected officials of minority groups are often unable to perform their duties due to obstruction of the other councillors or the municipality. In many cases, elected councillors are still unable to reclaim their prewar accommodations, and are therefore forced to live in another city (often in the other Entity). In Drvar, for months Mayor Mile Marceta did not have an office nor keys to the building. Similar situations exist in many other parts of the country. In light of the conditions described above, we urge you to impress upon all authorities of Bosnia and Hercegovina with whom you meet that the peace process requires a new level of commitment by the authorities to implement the human rights components of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Specifically, we believe that you should insist upon full cooperation with the Tribunal; official action to end incidents of ethnic violence and hold accountable those responsible, including police officers; guarantees of the rights of displaced persons to return safely to their pre-war homes, including the revocation of discriminatory housing laws in RS; and free and fair elections, the results of which must be fully implemented. Moreover, in response to the growing sense of disillusionment with the peace process and with the quest for justice in particular, we feel that it will be especially important for the people of Bosnia to hear from you that the U.S. remains committed to the Tribunal and to securing the surrender or arrest of all individuals indicted on war crimes charges. THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION Human Rights Watch's current concerns in Russia are threefold: corruption, and its connection to human rights abuses; violence against women; and Russian foreign policies toward Belarus and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. We strongly urge you and President Clinton, during your visit to Moscow, to raise these concerns detailed below, which directly affect the rights of millions of people, in Russia and beyond, and are very clearly linked to U.S. policy interests in areas beyond human rights. Corruption We urge you to send a message to the Russian government and the Russian people that the U.S. government deplores the debilitating effects corruption has had not only on the Russian economy, but especially on the rule of law. The Russian government is riddled with corruption, and its current difficulties, including, for example, chronic wage and pension arrears, insider privatization deals and tax evasion, are often a consequence of corruption. Moreover, it has laid waste to the public institutions crucial to long-term economic development, the rule of law and human rights protection. Finally, it is difficult to overstate how thoroughly corruption has eroded public trust in these institutions. Among the most corrupt government institutions in Russia are its law enforcement agencies; this is no doubt of grave concern to the Clinton administration because it sabotages U.S. policy goals in fighting international crime. Corruption in law enforcement agencies also facilitates or is directly responsible for human rights abuses: ill-treatment and abuse in police custody, trafficking of women and police harassment of refugees and ethnic minorities. Throughout the past year, Human Rights Watch has researched police abuse in four Russian regions--Irkutsk, Arkhangelsk, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Ekatarinburg, in addition to Moscow and St. Petersburg. We found incontrovertible evidence in most places that police routinely torture or ill-treat criminal suspects, defendants and even witnesses (including juveniles) to compel testimony or a confession. Police are frequently more preoccupied with generating income through corruption than with criminal investigations, the quality of which is generally unacceptably poor. Criminal justice officials (police, prosecutors, and judges at local and regional levels) commonly solicit and accept bribes to drop charges and investigations, yet crime solving rates are higher than ever, no doubt due to torture and inventive falsification of crime statistics. Finally, corruption's rampancy in the Russian police has helped to foster the atmosphere of impunity that prevents abusive police from being brought to justice. Most commonly, police detectives beat criminal suspects in police stations in the earliest hours of custody. Other forms of torture include repeated suffocation with a simple plastic bag or gas mask. The suspect is effectively isolated from his family, and is routinely denied access to a lawyer. A confession by a torture victim practically guarantees a guilty verdict, as courts systematically ignore torture complaints and often base their verdicts primarily on confessions. Abusers are rarely brought to justice, as procuracy inquiries into police abuse are pro forma at best, and, without the approval of the case investigator, defense attorneys cannot order forensic testing for their clients to confirm torture allegations. Corrupt policing in Moscow seriously violates the rights of ethnic minorities. In a 1997 report, Moscow: Open Season, Closed City, we documented the predatory conduct of Moscow police in its enforcement of the propiska system. Police in the capital routinely detain people on residence permit checks and extort bribes from them. Such abuse is often accompanied by physical violence, and the alarmingly frequent invasion of privacy: according to police statistics, 1.3 million passport checks were conducted in private homes in the first five months of 1997; in many cases that Human Rights Watch documented, police enter the apartments forcibly. In neighborhoods with large refugee populations, police extort bribes from destitute asylum seekers on a monthly basis, amounting to an informal tax. Their victims in many cases are people with dark skin who seek refuge in Russia, usually from Central Asia, the Caucasus, Afghanistan, and some African countries. Corruption is directly linked to the trafficking of women. The Clinton administration announced on March 11 a firm commitment to fight the scourge of trafficking worldwide. The administration must now turn its attention to trafficking out of and through the Russian Federation. Trafficking cannot be eliminated solely through the adoption of new laws and support of grass-roots NGOs; the Russian government must also make a commitment to end the corruption which surely allows trafficking to flourish. According to media reports, traffickers allegedly rely on corrupt officials in various ministries to issue bogus passports, visas, and other documents. To date, the Russian government has not come forward with any initiatives to fight trafficking. We urge you to make clear in meetings with Russian officials that abuse by law enforcement agencies and the corruption that facilitates it sabotage U.S. policy aimed at building the rule of law and protecting rights. In 1997, the U.S. government funded more than sixty law enforcement training programs; the Russian government should be on notice that such programs will not serve to support corruption and abuse. Furthermore, the U.S. government should register alarm at the vicious blend of racism and corruption in the enforcement of residence permits, and should make clear that it is inconsistent with the purpose of U.S. funds targeting Russian migration programs. Violence against women In our recent report, Too Little, Too Late: State Response to Violence Against Women, Human Rights Watch documented the Russian government's systematic failure to respond to violence against women. Widespread police refusal to take reports and state failure to prosecute cases in the face of rampant rape and domestic violence constitute serious human rights violations. Our research revealed that police and prosecutors routinely reject or discourage complaints, suggesting that female complainants either provoked or fabricated attacks. In the rare cases in which rape reports are investigated, women are subjected to highly invasive and seemingly irrelevant broad inquiries into their psychological state, reputations and sexual histories. Remedying this situation demands political will to implement better policing and to adopt better criminal and criminal procedure laws. Pressure must be felt at the highest political levels in order to overcome tremendous resistance and stubborn prejudices. The Clinton administration has long emphasized that violence against women is a priority issue. Congress has mandated spending of up to $1.5 million in 1998 for law enforcement training programs focused on domestic violence in the Russian Federation. However, without overall policy change, these efforts will be for naught. High-level Russian government officials must make public statements condemning all forms of violence against women and pledging equal justice for victims of these human rights abuses. The Procurator General and the Minister of Internal Affairs must enact directives mandating that police and prosecutors make the investigation and prosecution of violence against women, in all its forms, a priority. In the fall of this year, the State Department plans to hold a conference on domestic violence in Moscow. This conference provides an excellent opportunity for the Russian government to announce initiatives to fight violence against women. In order to set the stage for the upcoming conference, as well as to support the growing grass-roots violence-against-women movement in Russia, Human Rights Watch urges that violence against women be raised at the summit as a serious, on-going human rights violation. President Clinton should seek assurances from President Yeltsin that Procurator General Yuri Skuratov and Minister of Internal Affairs Sergei Stepashin will send their deputies to the conference. Further, President Clinton should urge the Russian government to implement domestic violence and rape training programs for police and prosecutors, and discipline officers who refuse to take reports from victims of violence. Russian foreign policy toward Belarus and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Russia is perhaps the only member of the international community with key leverage over Belarus and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, whose leaders have created human rights disasters in their respective countries. Russia has largely failed to use this leverage at crucial moments to stop Belarus's return to Soviet-era authoritarian practices. Considering the Clinton administration's stated commitment to improving human rights in Belarus, it must, in this summit, press the Yeltsin administration to make the most of this leverage. The eviction of the U.S. and E.U. ambassadors from their residences in Minsk illustrated President Alexander Lukashenka's authoritarian style, just as human rights violations in Belarus since 1996 have clearly born his personal stamp. President Lukashenka's presidential decrees have flagrantly violated freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, and the right to due process. Our July report, Turning back the Clock, describes these and secret presidential instructions that seek to choke off information to the independent media. His political enemies have been subject to criminal prosecution; government security agents have clearly been involved in assaults and threats against politically independent persons, including an opposition newspaper editor, a human rights activist, and a film director. Since President Lukashenka is involved in the appointment of judges and can dismiss them, court hearings for his political enemies are unlikely to be fair, and anti-government demonstrators, graffiti writers and other political activists charged with misdemeanors are rubber stamps that generally result in jail terms and exorbitant fines. We hope that President Clinton will use the summit as a forum to call on the President Yeltsin to support the OSCE mission in Minsk and to engage the Belarusian government and President Lukashenka personally to respect fundamental principles of democracy and human rights as stipulated in the Russia-Belarus Union Charter. Russian foreign policy toward the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia should also be a high priority for the summit. Russian cooperation with the U.S. and other members of the Contact Group and Security Council is critical to solving the escalating crisis in Kosovo. As in Belarus, Russia enjoys important political, economic, and historic ties to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that give it special leverage with the Serbs. Russia's reticence to use this leverage to help bring an end to mounting human rights and humanitarian law violations is inexcusable. Since late February, discord within the international community, in particular between Russia and other key players, has given Slobodan Milosevic the green light to pursue a brutal crackdown resulting in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. A lack of cooperation with Russia must not get in the way of effective condemnation of abuses, enforcement of economic and military sanctions, or pursuit of other means necessary to end the conflict. In this regard, we welcome the recent collaborative efforts of the U.S. and Russian governments at shuttle diplomacy and monitoring conditions on the ground, and we urge you to make certain that Kosovo figures prominently in the summit agenda. Moreover, we believe that President Clinton should take the opportunity, jointly with President Yeltsin, to publicly condemn violations of international humanitarian law committed in Kosovo, vow to hold accountable those responsible for any such abuses, and commit to bringing the hostilities to a swift end. In closing, let me assure you that we appreciate the priority attention that you are paying to the situation in Croatia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and the Russian Federation. I hope that the information contained in this letter will be of assistance to you and your staff. Please do not hesitate to contact me if we can be of any additional assistance.

The organization also expressed alarm at press reports pointing to rebel threats to destroy electricity installations at the hydroelectric Inga dam, which supplies the DRC and neighboring countries with power.  We call on the rebel movement to immediately order a thorough investigation of the killings and to punish those found responsible,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the Africa Director of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch urged the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy to grant full access to the International Committee of the Red Cross to areas under their control. The organization also urged the rebels not to destroy the Inga power utility. """"International humanitarian law provides for the protection of objects essential to the survival of civilian populations, such as foodstuffs and drinking water installations and supplies. It also prohibits the destruction of structures containing dangerous forces, namely dams,"""" noted Takirambudde. Human Rights Watch has received credible reports that on Monday night the rebels rounded up and summarily executed villagers and missionaries at the Catholic mission in Kasika in the eastern province of South Kivu. The massacre was apparently in reprisal for an attack on rebel forces the previous day.  The rebels overran Inga hydroelectric dam in the early phase of their offensive on the capital Kinshasa from bases in the southwest of the country. Since then, they have repeatedly interrupted the power supply to the capital, leading to the disruption of running water supplies to the population. Medical services and supplies were also severely affected by the outage. Following the recent intervention on the government side of forces from Angola and Zimbabwe, the military balance dramatically shifted in favor of loyalist forces and their allies. According to reports in an Angolan government-owned newspaper, rebels besieged in the dam area threatened to destroy the electricity installations if they were not granted safe passage out of there. The rebels, who announced the Congolese Rally for Democracy on August 12, appointed a commissioner for justice and human rights, and have repeatedly pledged in press statements and public rallies to restore democracy and respect human rights. Human Rights Watch urged that the commissioner undertake an investigation of Kasika massacre and restrain field commanders in the Inga dam area from carrying out their reported threat of destroying the electric installations of the dam.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","International Justice"

Since then, the government has released several dozen prisoners, dropped charges against some detainees whose trials were pending, and """"rehabilitated"""" others who had served sentences under the previous administration. Many of these releases took place in connection with August 17, Indonesia's independence day, which is traditionally a time when releases and remissions are announced. The released prisoners include three elderly men involved with the Indonesian Communist Party in the 1960s; several prisoners accused of links to armed nationalist movements in Aceh, Irian Jaya, and East Timor; and others accused of various political offenses.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch welcome the releases; however, both organizations urge the Indonesian Government to ensure that there is a comprehensive release program for all those detained for their peaceful political activities and for the automatic review of convictions against all political prisoners.

Attached to this press release are excerpts from the 51-page report referring to Usama bin Ladin, the Saudi millionaire whose alleged training facilities were bombed by U.S. forces in Afghanistan today, and to allegations about a chemical weapons facility in Sudan. The report documents a steadily intensifying series of conflicts and conflicts-within-conflicts generally ignored by the international public, but not by global arms traders. """"The evidence shows a pattern of significant arms transfers to long-established human rights abusers — the government of Sudan and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA) — that is serving to intensify the conflicts within and around Sudan and increasing their impact on civilians there,"""" said Hiltermann. Ever larger populations are at risk, often due directly to the types of weapons used (for example, antipersonnel landmines) or the way in which they are used. The entire region remains awash in cold war-era arms, while the spread of combat in the 1990s has prompted further arms imports that are aggravating an already dangerous situation. The external actors most directly involved in arming the government of Sudan, or providing other forms of military assistance (including training, technical assistance, and funds), have been China, Iran, Iraq, former Soviet bloc states, South Africa, France, Malaysia, and, at a less significant level, a number of other states. Moreover, weapons and ammunition of apparent Belgian, British, Bulgarian, Chilean, Israeli, Italian, Swedish, and U.S. origin have been found among government stocks captured by rebel forces. In the view of Human Rights Watch, governments remain responsible for the ultimate use of their weapons, even if they did not originally supply them to abusive forces. In recent years, the government of Sudan has continued to enhance its conventional arms capability through the acquisition of large quantities of light and medium arms and ammunition, medium tanks, and artillery and air power. The increased use of Mi-24 helicopter gunships, MiG fighter-bombers, and Antonov-26s since 1996 has had considerably more impact on civilians than on combatants, and has contributed to the displacement of tens of thousands of civilians in eastern and northeastern Sudan, the sites of new fighting in 1997 and 1998. The acquisition by the government of substantial numbers of a modified version of the classic Soviet T-54 tank — a Chinese-made model, known as the T-59 — in 1997 suggests a possible further intensification of the conflict. If, in addition, the government of Sudan has managed to acquire SCUD missiles, as is alleged by a Sudanese diplomat who defected in 1997, the potential exists for a widening of the regional scope of the conflict, and possibly an intensification of the fighting itself. The government of Sudan itself has been actively engaged in training, equipping, and in other ways supporting armed groups which are spreading violence throughout the immediate region and beyond, for example the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA), which has operated in southern Sudan and northern Uganda.  Among the other weapons having a direct impact on civilians in the war have been antipersonnel landmines. Human Rights Watch observed hundreds of landmines of many types — some whose origins traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, others of recent vintage — in Sudanese government military storage areas in southern Sudan captured in 1997 by opposition forces. Human Rights Watch also observed large numbers of landmines of the same types and nearly identical lot numbers in areas of neighboring Eritrea and Uganda which had been taken from rebel groups supported by the government of Sudan. While all sides to the conflicts within Sudan and in neighboring states have accused each other of deploying landmines, the main evidence Human Rights Watch saw of their use was by the government of Sudan.  For its part, the SPLA, and its allies in the coalition National Democratic Alliance (NDA), have received political, military, and logistical support from Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. Eritrean tank crews and trainers, as well as close reconnaissance units, accompanied SPLA troops in a March 1997 campaign in southern Sudan. Ugandan troops have entered Sudanese territory on the side of the rebels and engaged government forces and rebels of the LRA in combat on a number of occasions. Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda, in turn, have received military support from the United States, and also have large stores of cold war-era arms left over from the U.S., Israel, the former Soviet bloc states, North Korea, and other states. The SPLA has a substantial mechanized fleet of tanks and armored cars, some of which it claims to have captured from the government of Sudan in 1996 and 1997. Others were provided by Ethiopia in the 1980s or obtained from sources on the international arms market via Uganda in the 1990s. Another NDA member, the Sudan Alliance Forces (SAF), is also known to have acquired T-55 tanks — capturing them from the government of Sudan in April 1997 — and is said by its own leaders to be using them in combat. The presence of such arms, as well as artillery, makes it likely that there will be further bouts of conventional warfare in and around major population centers, such as Juba, Wau, and Malakal in the south and Gedaref and Kassala in the northeast. Violations of human rights and the laws of war have been widespread, systematic, and prolonged throughout the civil war in Sudan. Human Rights Watch holds that armed forces that commit gross violations of international human rights or humanitarian law (the laws of war), be they governmental or rebel groups, should not be further armed by members of the international community. Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the international community to immediately institute an arms embargo against both the government of Sudan and anti-government insurgents united in the NDA in order to send a strong signal to all sides in the war that their abusive conduct will no longer be tolerated. The European Union’s arms embargo on Sudan appears by and large to have been effective; it now needs to be extended to the international community as such. An international embargo should remain in place until all sides have put a halt to serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and have brought to justice serious offenders. Other recommendations by Human Rights Watch concern the United Nations, the Organization of African Unity, the European Union, states neighboring Sudan, the government of Sudan, and Sudanese rebel groups.","Africa, Sudan","Arms"

Israel's use of torture, arbitrary detention, and hostage-taking were among twenty-one violations and areas of concern addressed by the United Nations Human Rights Committee in its first review of Israel's implementation of the ICCPR, which ended 31 July 1998. The full text of the Human Rights Committee's """"Concluding Observations"""" on Israel is included in the report. While other U.N. expert bodies have evaluated Israel's fulfillment of its obligations under human rights treaties prohibiting discrimination against women, racial discrimination, and torture, the Human Rights Committee's review marks the first time Israel has reported on the full range of civil and political rights guaranteed by international law. Several of the Human Rights Committee's findings are also relevant to Israel's implementation of rights guaranteed by the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which is to be reviewed during the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights' November 16 to December 4, 1998 session. Israel's submission to the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/1990/5/Add.30) is also incomplete, in that it does not report on implementation of that convention in all the territories Israel controls. Human Rights Watch calls on Israel to implement the recommendations of the Human Rights Committee, as well as the earlier recommendations of the U.N. Committee against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the U.N. Committee Against All Forms of Racial Discrimination, and the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. Given the extremely serious nature of many of the violations identified by the Human Rights Committee, Israel should give special priority to immediately ending its practice of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment during interrogation and detention, and its discriminatory practices in regulating housing, family reunion, and residency rights. Human Rights Watch calls on Israel to: Immediately end the practice of torture, amend domestic law to be consistent with the covenant’s prohibition of torture, including adopting a definition of torture consistent with international law, and make public the guidelines governing interrogation procedures;  Immediately end the practice of holding detainees as hostages, both inside Israel and in the territories under its control. Persons held as “bargaining chips” should be immediately released; Immediately end the practice of arbitrary or prolonged administrative detention, and revise its laws to ensure that all detainees are guaranteed at minimum the right to prompt and effective judicial review of the lawfulness and conditions of their detention; the right to receive an explanation of one’s rights upon arrest in one’s own language or soon thereafter and to be informed of the specific, detailed, and personalized reasons for the deprivation of liberty; the right of immediate access to family, legal counsel, and a medical officer; and the right to be released and seek compensation if the detention is arbitrary or unlawful","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

Musa Kurhasku, correspondent for the largest Albanian-language daily newspaper, Koha Ditore, was taken into police custody today around 3:00 p.m. from his home in Dakovica. Five policemen reportedly raided his home and confiscated articles, documents, his telephone book and telex machine. According to the Koha Ditore editorial offices in Prishtina, Mr. Kurhasku had been summoned to the Dakovica police station Wednesday morning. The police allegedly told him to go to another city, Orahovac, in order to negotiate the release of an ethnic Serb who had been captured by members of the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA). Mr. Kurhasku reportedly refused to go, saying that it was not a journalist’s responsibility to act as a broker or to do the work of the Red Cross. Although Human Rights Watch could not confirm this story, it is consistent with other reports of Serbian police ordering ethnic Albanian civilians to negotiate with the KLA. Human Rights Watch called today for Mr. Kurhasku’s immediate release. The diplomatic missions of the Contact Group were also urged to apply pressure on the Yugoslav government to ensure his release and to guarantee full respect for freedom of the press.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Copies of the two letters are attached. For more information contact: Julia Hall (212) 216-1267 17 August 1998 Tony Blair Prime Minister 10 Downing Street London SW1 A 0AA United Kingdom Dear Prime Minister Blair: Human Rights Watch joins you in your unequivocal condemnation of the recent bombing in Omagh, Northern Ireland, which led to a tragic loss of life and hundreds of grievous injuries. We also share your — and the public's — desire to see that those responsible for this heinous crime are apprehended and brought to justice. Understandably, there is great public pressure on your government to use all means necessary to root out the perpetrators. With the political focus firmly trained on security issues, Human Rights Watch urges the government of the United Kingdom to act in accordance with international human rights standards in the course of its investigation of the bombing. By conforming with its human rights obligations, the government secures a legitimacy that those responsible for this horrible attack sought to undermine.  Human Rights Watch encourages a fair, impartial and professional investigation of the Omagh bombing that conforms with democratic principles. Our past research, however, indicates that in the immediate aftermath of acts of political violence, the security forces— under cover of the emergency legislation— routinely flout their responsibility to protect the rights of those suspected of political crimes. Human Rights Watch thus urges the U.K. government to conduct its investigation in accordance with internationally recognized guarantees of due process and the right to fair trial. To that end, we recommend that all detainees be permitted speedy access to counsel. Mindful of previous allegations of ill-treatment at the hands of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the risk of pressure to secure convictions at this time, we also urge the U.K. government to ensure that detainees are not subject to physical and/or psychological abuse in violation of the prohibition against cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.  Also of concern to Human Rights Watch is the possibility that internment— imprisonment without trial— will be used to incarcerate people on suspicion of their affiliation with dissident republican paramilitary groups. The prospect of resurrecting internment powers in Northern Ireland is profoundly problematic. Just last year the U.K. government moved to abandon the power of internment— not only because internment powers went unused for many years, but also because there appeared to be a genuine recognition that internment was one of the most egregious abuses of state power.  The political ramifications of reinstituting internment powers cannot be overstated. Violating the rights of a group can only serve to further radicalize the group and it supporters. Moreover, internment is extremely inefficient and, historically, has caught many innocent people with no interest in violence in its net. As opposed to rendering dissident paramilitary groups powerless, internment has the real possibility of further empowering them by fueling potential claims that the U.K. government acts outside the law.  We will also be writing to Taoiseach Bertie Ahern with respect to the issue of internment in the Republic of Ireland. The Omagh bombers clearly sought to undermine the Multi-Party Agreement. The agreement's human rights provisions recognize that the promotion and protection of human rights— and accountability for past human rights violations— are essential elements for a just and lasting peace. By conducting its investigation in accordance with international human rights norms, the U.K. government both honors the principles enshrined in the agreement and fulfills its duty to vigorously bring the perpetrators of the Omagh bombing to justice.

Human Rights Watch also criticizes the law's requirement that research institutes and public opinion polling centers must obtain government approval before accepting local or foreign funds for projects. This sets an alarming precedent because it allows the state to interfere in civil society and block independent research that is not to its liking.  """"This law is an anachronism,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"News and other information from around the world is freely available on the Internet, but the government is attempting to censor what local newspapers can publish, and control what books and foreign newspapers Jordanians can read.""""  Human Rights Watch adds that the law will have an enduring impact on Jordanian society because of its highly restrictive approach concerning what can be legally printed and distributed in the Kingdom. """"Unless the Senate takes action to reject or substantially revise the problematic provisions, this law will increase self-censorship, limit the public's access to a diversity of news, information and ideas, and drastically affect the content of what is written, published and read in Jordan,"""" Megally said.  The full text of the letter to His Excellency Zeid Rifai is attached. For information, contact In New York: Hanny Megally 212-216-1230 Virginia N. Sherry 212-216-1231 In Brussels: Jean-Paul Marthoz 322-732-2009 13 August 1998 The Honorable Zeid Rifai Speaker Upper House of Parliament Amman, Jordan Your Excellency: Since last year, Human Rights Watch has closely monitored the government's efforts to impose substantial restrictions on newspapers, books, and other written materials that are published or distributed in Jordan. Following the enactment of temporary amendments to the press and publications law in May 1997, we cautioned that Jordan, as a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has a duty to both publishers and readers to guarantee the freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds that is required by Article 19 of the Covenant. We are deeply disappointed with the amended press and publications law that was approved by the Chamber of Deputies on August 9. It contains numerous provisions that contravene Jordan's obligations under international law, and imposes a daunting regime of censorship on journalists, writers, editors, scholars, researchers, and publishers. If the law is enacted without substantial revisions, we fear that it will pose a direct threat to freedom of expression in Jordan, and place press freedom and academic freedom at particular risk.  We are writing to you today because the Senate now has the opportunity to examine carefully the various articles of the law that have generated sustained criticism by Jordanians as well as international human rights and press freedom organizations. We respectfully call to the attention of Your Excellency and other members of the Senate the following provisions of the law that compromise freedom of expression in Jordan and should be rejected: Prohibited topics The law prohibits categorically the publication of any type of information on a staggering range of vaguely worded topics. Article 5 bans the publication of anything that """"contradicts"""" the principles of freedom and national responsibility, human rights, and the values of the Arab Islamic Nation. Article 37 contains a list of additional prohibited topics, including anything that concerns the armed forces or the security apparatus; """"disparages"""" the King or the Royal Family; """"harms national unity""""; """"instigates"""" strikes, sit-ins, or public gatherings; """"shakes confidence"""" in the national currency; or involves """"degradation,"""" """"libel,"""" or """"slander"""" of the heads of Arab, Islamic or friendly states. Violators of the content bans outlined in Article 37 will be subjected to financial penalties ranging from 5,000 Jordanian dinars ($7,037) to 10,000 dinars ($14,075), with the fines doubled for repeat offenses (Article 47).  The law's sweeping content bans, coupled with the substantial fines, appear designed to impose a regime of self-censorship on the press and other publications, and to prevent journalists and authors from writing about a wide range of domestic and foreign policy issues. The broadly formulated language of the prohibited topics invites arbitrary interpretation by authorities. It wrongly places the burden on writers, editors and publishers to guess what is meant by these ambiguous terms or face punitive fines and other sanctions.  Article 19(3) of the ICCPR allows restriction of expression only in limited circumstances, namely in the interest of """"respect of the rights or reputations of others"""" or """"the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of public health or morals."""" Such restrictions must be """"provided by law"""" and be """"necessary."""" These exceptions are narrowly framed, and the burden of demonstrating their validity rests with the state. The internationally recognized norms of free expression require that the state justify any content ban by showing that restrictions are necessary to achieve a specific and legitimate purpose within one of the enumerated exceptions.  Imposition of News Blackouts Article 39 of the law gives extremely broad discretion to judicial authorities to ban reporting about trials and criminal investigations if, in their judgment, such reporting would """"influence"""" the proceedings. This provision is not in conformity with international standards, which provide for a more specific and narrow test in order to impose such censorship. Article 14(1) of the ICCPR permits exclusion of the public and press """"from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the Parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice.""""  Pre-Publication Censorship and the Banning of Books The law also prohibits the printing or circulation of books in Jordan without government approval. Article 35 requires that two copies of any manuscript be provided to the press and publications department of the Ministry of Information prior to printing. It permits the director of the department to ban the publication of any manuscript that contains material in violation of the law. There is a similar provision for imported publications. Article 31 stipulates that foreign publications must also be vetted by the press and publications department prior to distribution or sale in Jordan, and empowers the director to ban any publication that contains material in violation of the law. These articles open the door for the state to ban books that include material on the prohibited topics listed in Article 5 and Article 37.  Under Article 48 of the law, possession or distribution of an unauthorized foreign publication -- such as the banned issue of a newspaper published abroad -- carries a maximum fine of 1,000 Jordanian dinars ($1,407).  Closure of newspapers and other publications The law permits courts to suspend the publication of any newspaper or periodical while a case against it is in progress (Article 50). Such action can be taken for reasons of public interest or national security, with the length of a closure solely at the discretion of the courts. Given the numerous vaguely worded provisions of the law that can be used to bring cases against newspapers for possible violations, we fear that Article 50 may be used to harass independent publishers and force their publications off the newsstands for indeterminate periods of time. Restrictions on activities of independent nongovernmental institutes Article 41 prohibits research institutes and public opinion polling centers from receiving financial assistance from Jordanian or foreign donors for study or research without prior approval of the Minister of Information. This provision sets an alarming precedent by granting the executive branch the power to intervene directly in the planned activities of these important institutions of civil society, and to block virtually any initiative that is not to the state's liking.  While any government has the responsibility to ensure that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) conduct their affairs in a transparent and accountable manner, the means and methods of exercising this delicate responsibility should ensure full respect for human rights principles. Article 41 constitutes excessive government interference in the internal affairs of NGOs by shifting control over two key aspects of their operations -- programs and funding -- to the state.  The press and publications law is a critically important piece of legislation that will have an enduring impact on Jordanian society because it sets the parameters of what can be legally printed and distributed in the Kingdom. The provisions of the law apply to written materials produced in Jordan or abroad, including books, daily and weekly newspapers, magazines and other periodicals, and reports and studies of academics and researchers.  In our view, the sweeping restrictions and harsh penalties in the current law, as amended by the Chamber of Deputies, will increase self-censorship, limit the public's access to a diversity of news, information and ideas, and drastically affect the content of what is written, published, and read in the Kingdom. We are particularly concerned that the law will substantially diminish academic freedom and freedom of the press, and interfere with the independent work of nongovernmental research and public policy institutes. Human Rights Watch therefore respectfully appeals to Your Excellency and the other members of the Senate to review comprehensively each provision of the press and publications law, and cancel or revise substantially the articles noted above that constitute unreasonable or unnecessary interference with the exercise of the right to freedom of expression in Jordan.  Thank you in advance for Your Excellency's attention to this most important matter. Sincerely,","Middle East/North Africa, Jordan","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Radio broadcasts on August 8 from a government regional radio in the eastern town of Bunia monitored by the BBC called on the local population to use """"a machete, a spear, an arrow, a hoe, spades, rakes, nails, truncheons, electric irons, barbed wire, stones, and the like, in order, dear listeners, to kill the Rwandan Tutsis."""" On Wednesday the 12th, a local commander of the Congolese army called on Bunia residents to """"take revenge"""" on the Rwandans and """"massacre them without mercy."""" The DRC government has accused the small minority of Congolese ethnic Tutsis of leading the current rebellion and credibly alleges that Rwanda has invaded its territory in support of the rebels. This stimulation of ethnic hatred by government officials raises serious human rights concerns because of its sadly well-proven record for triggering large-scale killings. Hate radio broadcasts prepared the stage for the 1994 Hutu-led genocide in neighboring Rwanda against the minority Tutsi population in which at least half a million were killed. The conflict spilled over in neighboring DRC, contributing to the destabilization of the country and the spread of political violence in its eastern provinces ever since. Ethnic bloodletting continued on Congolese territory during the 1996-97 military campaign that brought President Kabila to power when his former allies reportedly massacred thousands of unarmed Hutu refugees in apparent retribution for the 1994 killings in Rwanda. Human Rights Watch views with deep concern the continuation of the ethnic witch hunt in the capital Kinshasa. Hundreds of ethnic Tutsis continue to be detained in Kokolo military camp in Kinshasa, and hundreds more are held in unknown places. The increasing use of hate propaganda by DRC officials exposes these detainees and other Tutsis to potential ill-treatment and even random killings as the public may interpret these messages as prior approval or a guarantee of impunity if they were to engage in such atrocities. Human Rights Watch received credible reports from rebel-held Bukavu about atrocities committed by rebel soldiers against residents during a house-to-house search in the """"Essence"""" neighborhood. Rebel soldiers were looking for alleged infiltrators from the anti-rebel Mayi-Mayi warrior groups. Wide-scale looting and armed robbery were also reported by town residents as well as by departing humanitarian workers. The offices and warehouses of a humanitarian agency in Bukavu were looted by soldiers who held employees at gunpoint and threatened to kill them. Human Rights Watch calls on the government of the DRC to guarantee the rights and protect the safety of ethnic Tutsis who are in its custody or are living in areas under its control. We urge the government to grant the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the DRC Field Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights full access to the detainees in accordance with international standards. The government should also facilitate the departure of ethnic Tutsis who wish to leave the country. We urge the rebel authorities to guarantee the rights and safety of civilian populations in areas under their control and to abstain from any attacks on rights defenders and community leaders in these areas. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to assume its full responsibility in taking firm steps to denounce abuses against civilians by all parties to the present conflict in the DRC, and to hold perpetrators of such abuses responsible.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

Human Rights Watch also urged rebel forces to refrain from recruitment of under-18's, and to demobilize all child soldiers who are already in their ranks.  Prior to taking power in 1996, thousands of children (known as """"kadogo"""") were recruited into Kabila’s army. Many of these children continue to serve as soldiers in both rebel and government forces, and are also being mobilized as part of the current conflict.  International law prohibits the recruitment of any children under the age of 15, and an international consensus is building on behalf of prohibitions on any military recruitment below the age of 18. The U.N. Security Council recently expressed its grave concern at the harmful impact of armed conflict on children, and condemned the use of child soldiers. In a June 29 statement, the Council called upon all parties concerned to comply strictly with their obligations under international law.  """"The use of child soldiers violates both international law and common standards of decency,"""" said Jo Becker, Children’s Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"President Kabila’s recruitment of children flies in the face of increasingly active efforts by the global community to end this reprehensible practice.""""  Recent international actions related to the use of child soldiers have included provisions in the new treaty establishing an International Criminal Court (ICC), and the launching of a new international campaign led by nongovernmental organizations to raise the minimum age for recruitment and participation in armed forces. Under the new ICC treaty drafted last month in Rome, the conscription and use in hostilities of children under the age of 15 is defined as a war crime to be prosecuted by the Court.  In late June, Human Rights Watch, together with Amnesty International and other leading international nongovernmental organizations, launched a new Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers, which seeks stronger international standards to protect children from military recruitment and use in armed conflict. The Coalition seeks to raise the minimum age for military recruitment and participation in armed conflict from 15, set by existing international law, to 18.  The latest research on child soldiers estimates that more than 300,000 children under 18 years old are fighting in armed conflicts around the world. Although most recruits are over 15 years of age, significant recruitment starts at 10 years, and the use of even younger children has been recorded","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

But the organization said that the fear created by attacks and threats in the immediate post-election period had already done its work, making people in Phnom Penh and outside the capital wary of voicing dissent or supporting opposition organizations. It called on the international community to exert pressure on Hun Sen to disarm and punish the perpetrators of the latest incidents of attacks on opposition party members so that Cambodians could freely exercise their rights to freedom of expression, association, and assembly.  Following Cambodia's July 26 election, hundreds of opposition party activists fled their homes after a wave of reprisals and threats by officials or security forces affiliated with Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP). Dozens of opposition members have sought safety in provincial party offices, while others have gone into hiding or made their way to political party headquarters or relatives' homes in Phnom Penh.  """"The fact that the violence has subsided temporarily does nothing to ease the intense fear among opposition supporters, particularly in the provinces, that they are going to become targets of violence. It also does nothing to prevent another wave of repression against them once the international spotlight is lifted,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"This kind of intimidation has been occurring since the July 1997 coup, and few concrete steps have been taken by the authorities to curb it. The ultimate effect is to stifle political participation.""""  Human Rights Watch said that the intimidation of opposition members decreased after an August 1 televised appeal for calm by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party emerged as the top vote-getter in preliminary election results released last week. However, the rights organization has continued to document ongoing threats and retaliation against opposition members in the ten days following Hun Sen's statement, which was distributed by officials in the provinces.  Opposition members have reported that they have been threatened by village and commune chiefs, or their houses have been surrounded by soldiers or militia men, often armed with AK47s or other weapons. In several instances, shots have been fired at opposition members or their houses, although to date no one has been killed. In addition, several opposition activists have been beaten up or followed by members of the CPP, or by commune and militia chiefs. In many of these cases, opposition members have been threatened with death unless they leave their homes.  In some instances opposition members have fled their villages without having received specific or direct threats, prompted instead by fears instilled during the volatile months preceding the elections, in which villagers were warned of repercussions should they vote the """"wrong"""" way.  Most of the people targeted after the election have been opposition activists who served as election monitors for their parties, particularly those who lodged complaints about irregularities in the polling and counting processes. In addition, two of the widows of opposition activists murdered during the election campaign have also been harassed by local officials for speaking to the press or asked to sign statements that they are members of the CPP. Some Cambodians who served as election observers for independent local NGOs in the provinces have also received threats or been pressured not to release incriminating information about election irregularities. In some communes where the CPP lost, village chiefs and/or militia chiefs have been demoted or reassigned, suggesting that the CPP may begin to launch an internal sweep of its own ranks aimed at party members who did not deliver the vote.  In a new wave of reprisals during the last week, activists returning to their home provinces from Phnom Penh were threatened for complaining to human rights organizations, their party offices, or the foreign media.  The fact that that there was high voter turnout and few incidents on polling day does not mean that there was a neutral political environment in which all parties could freely compete. The entire year preceding election day was marked by political violence, widespread intimidation, and murders of opposition members and supporters of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who was ousted in the July 1997 coup. In the two months prior to the election, eighteen people were killed in murders that appeared to have been related to the electoral process, according to the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.  The majority of the cases of post-election reprisals have come from the provinces of Takeo, Prey Veng, Kompong Cham, and Svay Rieng, with incidents reported in Kratie, Kompong Thom, Siem Reap, Kampot, Koh Kong, Kandal, and Phnom Penh as well. The following cases documented by Human Rights Watch are illustrative (names and other identifying details have been deleted to protect the security of sources):  On August 6 at 7:30 p.m. an unidentified man with his face covered by a scarf assaulted a Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) youth activist in his home in Prey Chor District, Kompong Cham. The youth was wearing a SRP party T-shirt at the time.  On August 5 at 8 p.m., a member of the commune militia in Kien Svay District, Kandal shot three bullets in the air in front of the house of a SRP activist who had previously complained about party agents not being allowed to accompany ballot boxes from the commune counting center to the provincial town. On August 5 in Kompong Trabek District, Prey Veng, four militia threatened a member of Prince Ranariddh's Funcinpec Party by saying, """"If you continue to serve Funcinpec, tomorrow we will shoot you dead."""" The activist went into hiding in another province. On August 3 at 11:00 p.m. six unidentified men with their faces covered by scarves, all armed with AK47 rifles, gathered at the house of a SRP activist from Svay Reap District, Svay Rieng. The group disbanded when a group of villagers returning from a video parlor passed by. The activist went into hiding. On August 3 at 7:30 p.m. in Koh Kong, a member of the village militia called a SRP activist to come out of his house and then fired a gun at him, missing. When the activist ran back into his house, the armed man continued to shout that he was going to kill him. A local policeman arrived and got the perpetrator to leave but did not disarm him. Half an hour later, the perpetrator returning, aiming his gun again at the SRP activist before being chased off again. That night the SRP signboard was pulled down from in front of the house of the activist, who went into hiding. On August 1 in Peam Ro district, Prey Veng, a commune chief threatened to """"take out"""" (i.e. kill) seven Funcinpec members in the commune. On July 28 at 12:00 noon in Ang Snuol District, Kandal, six armed soldiers beat up a SRP activist who was wearing a SRP T-shirt, saying, """"You know Sam Rainsy lost the election, why are you still staying around this village?"""" The victim went home and stayed there until the afternoon of August 2, when he planned to go to the SRP office in Phnom Penh. Along the way he met four of the same soldiers who had beaten him previously. They asked him where he was going and accused him of going to lodge a complaint at the party headquarters in Phnom Penh. One threatened to kill him. The soldiers took the activist's party membership papers and burnt them, and then slapped and kicked him. """"Don't go to Phnom Penh,"""" he was told. """"Go home and wait for your death."""" The man did not return to his house that night but slept at a friend's home in the same village. That evening at 8:00 p.m. his younger brother came to tell him that soldiers and police were at his house looking for him and accusing their mother of hiding him. That evening the man's uncle took the man to another province, where he went into hiding. On July 27 at 12:20 p.m. in Kirivong District, Takeo, a SRP observer was shot at after leaving a ballot counting center. The victim, who was unharmed, had lodged several complaints during the polling and counting process, and had been told by the Commune Chief, """"You're objecting too much?I will shoot you."""" After the SRP observer left the counting station two men followed him on a motorcycle, firing an AK47 at him but missing. The SRP activist fled to another province. On July 27 a SRP party observer from Peam Ro District, Prey Veng, who had lodged several complaints during the polling and counting processes, was insulted and beaten in the face and on the arm by a CPP group leader. The man fled to Phnom Penh, where he was interviewed by the press. On August 3, the man's wife came to Phnom Penh as well, to warn her husband not to return because local authorities were angry that her husband had spoken to the foreign broadcast media about being harassed. On July 27 in Chikreng District, Siem Reap, a SRP activist who had raised complaints with election officials during the counting was threatened by security staff at the counting site. """"Do you want to die?"""" they asked. Later that day, ten district police men armed with AK47s went to the activist's house and shot into the air, telling the man's wife, """"Your husband has run with Sam Rainsy? Tell him to go and stay with Rainsy. If we comes back we will shoot him dead."""" On July 27 and 28 in Peam Ro District, Prey Veng, a Funcinpec commune leader's house was surrounded by three armed men for two consecutive nights. His wife, a market seller, overheard three policemen say that they """"had a plan"""" for her husband. With that information, he decided to flee the village.","Asia, Cambodia",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/08/06/new-burma-policy-needed-after-decade-no-results","New Burma Policy Needed After Decade of No Results","New Burma Policy Needed After Decade of No Results","","08/06/1998","Ten years after a Burma became a pariah state by crushing a pro-democracy uprising, engagement and isolation strategies to promote human rights have both failed, Human Rights Watch said today. A decade after the August 8, 1988 crackdown, the military still has a stranglehold on power, human rights abuses are rampant, and the economy is in a tailspin. Human Rights Watch is calling for a new, multilateral policy that would include the following elements: recognition that the three key actors that will determine Burma's future are the army (Tatmadaw); the democratic opposition led by Aung San Suu Kyi; and the ethnic minority organizations, some of which are armed, along Burma's borders with Thailand, China, India, and Bangladesh. A new policy would have to involve communication with all three. Communication with the army, however, should not be seen as in any way legitimating its role.  recognition that coordination and establishment of common ground is necessary among Western donors, Japan, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and China. President Clinton and EU leaders in particular could make good use of improved relations with China to actively engage China in finding a solution to the Burma impasse.  development of a road map by which specific steps toward verifiable human rights improvements on all fronts would gradually lead to incremental restoration of normal economic and diplomatic relations with the international community.  It is not difficult to show the failure of current policies. There are today an estimated 1,300 political prisoners in Burma's jails; over 1 million internally displaced persons, mainly in ethnic minority areas; some 200,000 refugees in neighboring countries, including Thailand, Bangladesh, India, and China; and at least 800,000 illegal migrant workers in Thailand alone, with several thousand more in Japan, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. The public health and education sectors have all but collapsed, with the average per capita spending on health in 1996 a mere $0.50 per annum, while universities, closed for over three years from June 1988 to May 1991, then again from December 1991 to May 1992, were closed again after student demonstrations in December 1996 and have still not reopened.   The main opposition party, the National League for Democracy, has been decimated by arrests and intimidation. A series of draconian regulations and laws has made it legally impossible for any form of civil society to emerge. The use of forced labor, one of the most widely condemned practices of the Burmese government, has not abated but appears to have increased with the collapse of the economy and of neighboring Asian economies that drew Burmese migrant workers abroad. Like forced labor, a program of forced relocation of ethnic minority villages for purposes of """"internal security"""" has helped fuel the exodus of refugees to Thailand and Bangladesh. State promotion of Buddhism has played on existing communal tensions between ethnic Burmans, who are largely Buddhists, and minorities, who are mostly either Muslim or Christian.   The only real achievement of the government known until November 1997 as the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and since then as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has been the conclusion of cease-fire agreements with various ethnic insurgencies along Burma's borders. These agreements, which have lowered the level of actual fighting, have yet to develop into lasting political solutions, however, and they have come at an enormous price. In Shan State especially, they have been followed by an explosion of heroin production, as the government appears to have offered to turn a blind eye to the rebels' narcotics trade in exchange for a cease-fire. In other areas, the agreements have been preceded by major military offensives that have caused untold suffering to the civilian population and resulted in massive refugee outflows.   These developments have benefited no one, neither ASEAN with its policies of engagement nor Europe and the U.S. with their policies of sanctions. China may have benefited the most by taking advantage of the situation to become Burma's major arms supplier and one of its largest trading partners, but even China has been hurt by the drug and HIV explosion along its southern border and Burma's growing economic problems.   Ten years on, it is therefore time for a major reassessment of policy towards Burma. A new policy must include:  efforts to understand the nature of the three key actors in Burmese politics. The West knows and admires Aung San Suu Kyi; unlike Japan or the ASEAN countries, it knows little about the nature and ideology of the Burmese armed forces, the various actors in the military leadership, and the tensions within this consensus-driven government. The armed ethnic minority groups who between them command over 65,000 troops and control some of the most potentially profitable land in the country _ as well as some of them being producers of most of the world's heroin supply _ are even less well known and understood.  increased communication with all three actors. The U.S., for example, should now consider sending an ambassador to Rangoon, and ASEAN diplomats should continue their efforts to engage both the military and the democratic opposition.  a real effort at multilateralism. Since 1990, the key multilateral initiative has involved the passing of consensus resolutions at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights condemning human rights abuses in Burma and calling on the military to change its ways; since 1991 the U.N. General Assembly has also passed similar resolutions. Each year the resolutions get tougher, and each year Burmese leaders denounce them as """"interference"""" in Burma's internal affairs and refuse to implement them. These resolutions would be far more useful if they were understood by all as not being merely an annual exercise in condemnation but as the basis for establishing the benchmarks for Burma's acceptance back into the international fold. The upcoming meeting of the U.N. General Assembly in New York in September might be a good opportunity for the key parties interested in Burma, including China, to come together to discuss a coordinated strategy.  Finally, a road map needs to be laid out that would specify clearly how concrete steps toward the ending of forced labor, release of political prisoners, restoration of basic civil rights, and international access to border areas, among other measures, could lead progressively to a lifting of sanctions currently in place and a resumption of normal political and economic ties between Burma and the major industrialized countries.   Without a new policy, the next ten years in Burma may be no different than the last.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

The organization also charged that longstanding ethnic injustice, together with President Kabila's increasingly harsh rule, led to the current crisis.  In Kinshasa, ethnic Tutsis, perceived as enemies of the state, are currently the targets of extensive search and arrest operations, according to Human Rights Watch sources. In eastern Congo, community leaders who recently denounced the presence of Rwandan troops in their region today find themselves in areas under the control of these very forces.  The failure to grant basic citizenship rights to the large Tutsi minority living in eastern Congo was one of the triggers for the Rwandan-led insurgency which overthrew dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997. President Kabila disappointed his Rwandan backers, however, by failing to improve the status of ethnic Tutsis, leading to renewed strife in the east and tensions with Rwanda.  In addition, Kabila's rule became increasingly repressive. He banned political activities, closed human rights groups, had reporters beaten, and delayed a promised transition to democracy. He also obstructed a U.N. probe into massacres committed by his rebel troops and their Rwandan allies during his rise to power. """"Kabila's denial of the fundamental rights of the Congolese and his monopolization of the political process have sapped the country of its strength,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Africa director of Human Rights Watch. """"In the search for stability of the Congo, however, the international community, in particular the United States, was willing to excuse Kabila's exclusive governance and repressive practices.""""  """"This sad turn of events is a clear demonstration that only accountability, pluralistic governance, and the rule of law, not political expediency, can bring stability in the Congo and the entire region,"""" added Takirambudde.  Eyewitnesses reported to Human Rights Watch on Wednesday that government soldiers were arresting people of Tutsi origin at roadblocks in the capital Kinshasa and during door to door searches. Arrests occurred Wednesday at the Galérie Albert and Wagenia buildings in midtown Kinshasa. On Tuesday, government soldiers cordoned off l'Immeuble Royal, the building housing the office of the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and seized two Tutsi families and a UNDP local employee. Reliable sources informed Human Rights Watch that dozens of frightened Congolese Tutsis went into hiding as a """"witch hunt atmosphere"""" developed despite earlier government assertions that any attacks on foreigners and Tutsis would be severely punished.  Human Rights Watch is also gravely concerned about the safety of leaders of community organizations in South and North Kivu provinces who, because of their views on the rights of Congolese Tutsis and the role of Rwanda in the region might be perceived as hostile to Rwanda.  """"We are also concerned about the fate of the Archbishop of Bukavu and the governor of South Kivu who were in Goma when the mutiny broke out and urge authorities in control of that city to guarantee their safety,"""" said Takirambudde.

Serbian police and the Yugoslav army have launched their largest offensives to date against the ethnic Albanian insurgency. They appear to have used disproportionate force, attacking civilians and systematically destroying villages. At least 100,000 people are internally displaced, many hiding in canyons and forests, and 20,000 have fled the region altogether. Despite this, NATO is now further from taking action than it was a few months ago. The U.S. government has expressed only mild criticism, mostly because the Kosovo Liberation Army has become an annoying threat that it could not control. Diplomats in Kosovo are telling journalists that the West has turned a blind eye to the abuses in order to force the KLA to the negotiating table. The U.S. position is presented by Secretary of Defense William Cohen, who recently said that NATO """"does not want to see"""" Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's troops attacking civilians or using disproportionate force, but also does not want to take action that """"could be construed as lending support, either moral or military, to those seeking independence."""" Such a position spells disaster for the people in Kosovo and the region. Mr. Milosevic's troops are committing serious abuses, and there is no indication that the atrocities will stop. Human rights groups name five villages where summary executions have taken place since February. Hundreds of people have been arrested and abused; many villages have been destroyed. Many civilians must have died from indiscriminate artillery fire. Where is the threshold? At what point will the Clinton administration decide that it has seen enough? Understandably, Washington is concerned about the destabilizing effects that an independent Kosovo might have on neighboring Macedonia, with its sizable ethnic Albanian population, and on the fragile peace in Bosnia, where 20,000 U.S. soldiers are still on the ground. But unchecked atrocities, and the predictable KLA response, will feed a refugee outflow that could ignite an increasingly radical Albanian community in Macedonia. Washington is missing the fundamental point that there will be no stability in the Balkans as long as Mr. Milosevic stays in power. Despite past atrocities in Croatia and Bosnia, American officials still regard him as the man who can stop the fighting. The """"man with the reins"""" argument was used by Richard Holbrooke when Mr. Milosevic signed the 1995 Dayton accords, which stopped the fighting in Bosnia. But the international community's failure to punish Mr. Milosevic for crimes in Croatia and Bosnia sent the message that he would be allowed to get away with such crimes again. The man who started these conflicts cannot be trusted to stop them. There will be no lasting peace as long as Yugoslavia remains an undemocratic state with Mr. Milosevic at the helm. Even if the Albanians agree to autonomy, as the U.S. government is pressing them to do, there is no guarantee that Mr. Milosevic would end his repressive rule in Kosovo, or that he would not again revoke Kosovo's status at some point in the future. An abusive government in Belgrade will be a constant threat to the region. The first priority for U.S. policy should be his indictment. A second is continued cultivation of democratic alternatives within Serbia and Montenegro, with an emphasis on building institutions like independent courts and depoliticized police. Independent media should be supported. All options for Kosovo's political status should be considered, as long as they include guarantees for the rights of both Albanians and Serbs. Admittedly, strong action against Mr. Milosevic is a bad message to send to armed insurgencies with separatist agendas around the world. But equally bad is the current message to Mr. Milosevic and other aggressive dictators that their violence will be tolerated by the international community in the name of territorial integrity.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

The forty-four writers who hail from nineteen countries have faced obstacles ranging from imprisonment and torture to having their works banned and their phone lines severed. The Hellman/Hammett grants are given annually by Human Rights Watch to writers around the world who have been targets of political persecution. The grant program began in 1989 when the estates of writers Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett asked Human Rights Watch to assist writers in financial need as a result of expressing their views. This year, grants totaled $170,000.  Writers from Vietnam, Turkey, and Nigeria received a major portion of the 1998 grants, reflecting the especially repressive climate for free expression in those three countries. But as harsh as the situation is for writers there, conditions are equally severe in other countries where the signs of repression are less visible. Licencing policies and intimidation silence many voices before they can be heard. The suppression is just as egregious when expression is inhibited before it is put into words as when the abuse of writers is open and obvious.  In Vietnam, writers have faced harsh restraints for decades. This year's eight awards testify to the fact that the repressive conditions continue unabated in the context of a stalling economy, backlash over security concerns raised by improved relations with the United States, and a stalemate over political succession and liberalization within the Communist Party.  Nigeria's the use of arbitrary detention, torture, and censorship to quash writers has been an international scandal since the trial and execution of the noted playwright Ken Saro-Wiwa in 1995. The death last month of General Sani Abacha raises cautious hope for the release of political prisoners and implementation of the long stalled transition from military to civilian rule. But until Nigeria repeals the decrees that stifle free expression, writing there will remain a dangerous pursuit.  The eight Turkish recipients represent the wide range of thought (Islamist, Kurdish, leftist, and mainstream) for which writers are targeted in Turkey. Persecution is common for expressing views or reporting on the Kurdish question, the role of Islam in society, and the nature of the Turkish state. At the same time, great latitude is permitted on most other topics.  The writers selected to receive Hellman/Hammett grants in 1998 are a tiny portion of the many the world over whose books have been banned or who have been exiled, imprisoned, tortured,or harassed because of their work. In addition to the Vietnamese, Nigerian, and Turkish writers, this year's grant recipients include Miriam Tlali, a South African who vigorously condemned apartheid and paid the price for many years; Gordana Igric who, despite threats to her life, writes about human rights abuses in the former Yugoslavia; and Ahmad Taufik, an Indonesian journalist who has courageously covered taboo subjects like the wealth of the Soeharto family and human rights violations in East Timor.","Global",""

His wife, who visited but was not allowed to speak with her husband, said today that he is in serious condition and on dialysis.  """"Mr. Rukiqi's beating is a direct message to the human rights community in Kosovo,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division.

Mr. Rukiqi was involved in a number of human rights related cases, and had provided information on war crimes committed by Serbian special police forces in Kosovo to the International War Crimes Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague.  Rukiqi was arrested on July 23 and sentenced that same day in an expedited procedure to the maximum sixty days in prison for disturbing public order (under Article 6, paragraph 3 of the Serbian Law on Public Order). The arrest was related to an incident that morning, when Rukiqi had raised his voice at a district judge in Prishtina, Ms. Danica Marinkovic, after she had refused to let him view a case file of his client. The government tightly controls the judiciary and the police throughout Yugoslavia, especially in Kosovo. Judge Marinkovic has presided over a number of political trials against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in which the defendants were tortured.  Another local human rights activist, Ms. Zahrida Podrimcaku, was arrested in Prishtina on June 9, 1998.

Members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the rebel alliance in Sierra Leone, have been committing gross human rights violations since February 1998, when they were ousted from power.  The Human Rights Watch report, Sowing Terror: Atrocities Against Civilians in Sierra Leone, coincides with a special conference at the United Nations headquarters tomorrow in New York to discuss the security and humanitarian situation in Sierra Leone.  """"What's happening in Sierra Leone today is so gruesome, it defies imagination,"""" said Dr. Peter Takirambudde, the executive director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"Civilians are bearing the brunt of these horrific abuses. The conference at the U.N. tomorrow has got to do more to stop the carnage.""""  The Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG) ousted the AFRC/RUF alliance from power in February 1998 and reinstalled Ahmad Tejan Kabbah as president of Sierra Leone. Since that time, the scale and grotesque nature of the AFRC/RUF attacks have set this round of violence against civilians apart from others in Sierra Leone's seven-year history of devastating armed conflict.  """"With no recognizable political platform,"""" the report says, """"the AFRC/RUF is committing widespread and egregious atrocities against unarmed civilians in an attempt to regain power.... Many thousands of Sierra Leonean civilians have been killed, mutilated, amputated, raped or otherwise terrorized by the AFRC/RUF from the period of February through June 1998 alone. An additional number, probably in the thousands, of men, women and children have been abducted by the AFRC/RUF for use as combatants, forced laborers or sexual slaves.""""  Human Rights Watch also reports that forces fighting on behalf of President Kabbah have committed human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law. Among other concerns, Civilian Defense Forces (CDFs) have committed numerous abuses, including killings, torture and the obstruction of humanitarian assistance. Despite promises of the Sierra Leone government to demobilize all combatants under the age of 18, recent reports indicate that the CDFs continue to recruit children on a large scale.  Approximately one-quarter million Sierra Leoneans have fled to refugee camps in neighboring Guinea and Liberia in order to escape the abuses and fighting. Many of the refugees are languishing in camps in border areas with poor security conditions and difficult access for humanitarian assistance.  Human Rights Watch calls upon the Liberian government, ECOMOG, and the United Nations Observer Mission to Sierra Leone (UNOMSIL) to ensure that Liberian territory is not used in any fashion to support the AFRC/RUF. The report calls upon all sides of the conflict to stop the recruitment of children under the age of 18 and to demobilize all child combatants.  """"Demobilizing soldiers in this conflict is key,"""" said Takirambudde. """"and the U.N. is going to have to pay particular attention to human rights in order for that process to be successful."""" He called on the U.N. conference to set aside more resources for monitoring the human rights situation throughout Sierra Leone, as well as providing technical assistance and training to the Sierra Leonean government and local human rights groups.","Africa, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, International Justice, Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict"

Members of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), the rebel alliance in Sierra Leone, have continued to commit gross human rights violations -- including the use of child soldiers -- since February 1998, when they were ousted from power in February 1998 by the Economic Community of West African States Cease-Fire Monitoring Group (ECOMOG). In the period of February through June 1998 alone, the AFRC/RUF abducted an unknown number of civilians, probably in the thousands, including a substantial percentage of children for use as combatants, forced laborers, or sexual slaves.  In addition, despite promises of the Sierra Leone government to demobilize all combatants under the age of 18, recent reports indicate that the Civilian Defense Forces (CDFs) continue to recruit children on a large scale.  The report calls upon all sides of the conflict to stop the recruitment of children under the age of 18 and to demobilize all child combatants. """"Demobilizing soldiers in this conflict is key,"""" said Dr. Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch, """"and the U.N. is going to have to pay particular attention to human rights in order for that process to be successful.""""

We are witnessing an explosion of so-called dazzling laser weapon programs that could prove to be, in effect, blinding laser weapons in disguise,"""" said Stephen Goose, program director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"There is a real danger that the procurement and spread of such weapons could render the blinding laser ban meaningless,"""" said Goose.  Dazzling or glare-producing lasers have as their primary function attacking human eyes. In the letter to Secretary Cohen, Human Rights Watch writes, """"The distinction between a dazzling laser and a blinding laser remains disconcertingly unclear. We fear that weapons labeled as dazzlers could easily be used to blind intentionally, and that weapons labeled as dazzlers will proliferate greatly throughout the world.""""  Since 1995, when the U.S. agreed to the Blinding Laser Protocol of the Convention on Conventional Weapons, the Pentagon has cancelled several blinding laser weapon programs. President Clinton has stated that the U.S. will abide by the terms of the protocol, even though the Senate has yet to ratify it The protocol won the requisite twenty ratifications six months ago, and now enters into force on July 30.  Human Rights Watch identifies and provides details on a host of laser weapon programs of concern, including BOSS, Persuader, LX-5, Maglite, Saber 203, TLOS, Green Laser, Nighthawk and Y-Blue. In some cases, it appears that the very blinding laser weapons that were being developed prior to the 1995 policy (e.g., Saber 203, LCMS/TLOS) are being modified for deployment as dazzlers, with just a less apparent blinding attribute.  Human Rights Watch also expresses concern that lasers originally developed for dazzling and blinding missions are being offered to law enforcement agencies and potentially for commercial sale. In one notable example, a California-based company, Light Solutions, is reportedly developing a dazzling counter-terrorism """"green laser"""" for the Army on behalf of the U.S. Secret Service. A secret """"black"""" program, this laser is intended to defend the White House and other government buildings in Washington from someone who might employ a light plane or helicopter in an attack.  Human Rights Watch writes, """"The emergence of operational lasers intended to attack eyes ultimately has the effect of undermining the humanitarian and nonproliferation objectives of Protocol IV [Blinding Lasers]. U.S. military personnel are thus more likely to face blinding lasers on the battlefield. The emergence of anti-personnel lasers in the civilian world also opens the way for criminal elements to obtain anti-personnel lasers. For the U.S. to research and deploy these systems undermines the `norm' against blinding that Protocol IV represents.""""  A July 1996 U.S. intelligence report, Worldwide Laser Capabilities, obtained by Human Rights Watch under the Freedom of Information Act, concludes, """"Global proliferation of laser weapons is a real possibility."""" It states that """"Russia leads the world in the development of laser blinding weapons,"""" and reveals that Jordan has imported a laser dazzler.  The Human Rights Watch letter asks Secretary Cohen to: provide additional details about the laser weapon systems identified in its letter, particularly about their capacity to be used to blind permanently  clarify the distinction between blinding lasers and dazzling lasers articulate U.S. policy regarding development and use of lasers to attack human eyes explain the seeming contradiction between development of dazzling lasers and the DOD policy against lasers that even temporarily blind provide an explanation of how the U.S. will ensure that dazzling lasers, as potentially blinding weapons, will not be used to blind provide assurances that the U.S. is not seeking to undermine the letter or spirit of Protocol IV.

At the time of the outbreak of armed hostilities between Ethiopia and Eritrea in early June 1998, forty-six Ethiopian students were studying in Eritrea and eighty-five Eritrean students were studying in Ethiopia under a bilateral student exchange agreement between the two countries. On July 3, the Eritrean government allowed the Ethiopian students to return home.

V. Pillai Secretary General National Human Rights Commission Sardar Patel Bhawan Samsad Marg New Delhi 110 001 By Fax: 91-11-3340016 Dear Secretary Pillai: I am writing to alert you to the killings of at least eight and perhaps as many as thirty or more low-caste villagers in Vempenta, a village in Pamulapadu Mandal, Kurnool District, Andhra Pradesh. The incident took place in the early morning hours of July 16, 1998. To our knowledge, no one has yet been arrested in connection with the massacre.  Several hours before the killings began, a former village official and member of the high caste community named Sivaiah was murdered in his home, apparently by members of the People's War Group (PWG), a radical Marxist-Leninist organization that has advocated the use of violence to achieve land reform. According to a report prepared by a local human rights organization that visited the site on July 20, there were rivalries between the PWG and another leftist organization to which Mr. Sivaiah belonged, which may have provided the motive for the murder. As some members of the scheduled caste (Dalit or """"untouchable"""") Madriga community are believed to be sympathetic to the PWG, the murder apparently provided the high caste landlord community a pretext for attacking the Madriga colony in the village. Between 1:30 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. a mob rampaged through the colony hacking to death at least eight people and throwing their bodies into a house that was then set on fire. Some reports estimate the number killed to be thirty or more. At least 100 houses were burned to the ground. Most of those killed were Madrigas, although some also belonged to the Dalit Mala community and some to a another low caste community known as the Backward caste.  Local police did not appear on the scene for more than ten hours. As all of the Madriga families had fled out of fear, the police reportedly spoke only with members of the landlord community. The police have filed some forty cases against Madrigas suspected in the killing of Mr. Sivaiah. As of July 20, no charges had been filed against any of the villagers who participated in the attack on the Madriga colony. Madriga villagers interviewed by the human rights team stated that many of their attackers were still present in the village and appeared to have police protection.  The current tensions between the high-caste land holding villagers and low caste villagers emerged two years ago when Madrigas staked a claim to local temple lands that the high caste villagers had arrogated to themselves and began to cultivate them. Human rights activists who have investigated the incident believe that the land dispute was the real reason for the massacre.  As you are aware, attacks of this kind on Dalit communities in India are frequent and those responsible are seldom prosecuted. We urge you to send a team to investigate the incident as soon as possible and ensure that a case is registered under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and those responsible for the attack arrested and charged. The affected community should be provided protection and compensation, as provided under the law. The behavior of local police should also be investigated, and any found to have conspired with the attackers or to have failed to intervened promptly appropriately punished.  We look forward to hearing from you soon. Sincerely, Sidney Jones Asia Director of Human Rights Watch","Asia, India",""

The elections have been tainted by political violence and intimidation, and may not improve the country's progress towards genuine democracy, the rights group warned Human Rights Watch also expressed grave concern about the weeks after the polling, and fears that once the international spotlight has been removed, there may be reprisals against provincial- and district-level opposition party activists. """"The international community needs to keep up the pressure and maintain a visible presence in Cambodia during the critical transition period,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Foreign governments should respond strongly to any post-election abuses or violence."""" He urged them to support Cambodian human rights organizations and the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights of the United Nations (COHCHR), which are carefully documenting political violence during the campaigning and balloting process. Human Rights Watch also called for close monitoring of the post-election period, up until the seating of the new National Assembly and the formation of a new government. A neutral political environment for the elections has never been established, Human Rights Watch charged: the ongoing climate of political violence has not been addressed, and opposition political parties have not had access to television or radio to broadcast their platforms, or been able to freely campaign, particularly in the countryside.  The role of international observers is crucial in ensuring the integrity of the polling process. However, only 250 teams, consisting of two international observers each, will be deployed during the polling to cover more than 11,000 polling sites and 1,600 counting centers. Human Rights Watch urged donor countries and regional groupings such as the European Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to uphold international standards for this election and not overlook the serious shortcomings of the current electoral process. At stake is the credibility of the international community itself. The one-month 'official' campaign period, which is relatively sanitized and artificial, does not reflect the larger context of violence and intimidation, documented by Human Rights Watch,  COHCHR, and Cambodian human rights organizations. Until the formal campaign period began on June 24, the CPP was virtually the only party able to freely and actively conduct political activities in the countryside. The CPP's membership recruitment campaign has included heavy-handed pressure tactics by local officials and militia, who have gone house-to-house to solicit thumbprints and pledges from the populace to vote for the CPP, confiscated and recorded identification numbers on voter registration cards, and conducted """"mock elections"""" before the actual polling in which people are pushed to vote for the CPP. These pressure tactics in turn may have created serious doubts among the rural electorate as to whether this Sunday's ballot will indeed be secret, with many people fearing repercussions or violence if they vote for opposition parties. In spite of the heavy intimidation, Cambodians could still turn out to vote in large numbers on Sunday, defying the threats not to vote or not to vote their conscience. Despite high profile appearances by Sam Rainsy and Prince Ranariddh, who have drawn large crowds, local level opposition party activists in the countryside have been severely affected by the threat of political violence. The COHCHR has accumulated evidence on the killing of as many as 100 opposition members in the months following the July 5-6, 1997 coup. In addition, out of several hundred alleged incidents of political violence and intimidation received by COHCHR since May 25, eighty have been confirmed or assessed as credible, while another ninety cases are currently under investigation. Recent cases being investigated include eighteen murders which appear to have been related to the electoral process, such as the torture and killing of a FUNCINPEC electoral observer in June as well as the illegal detention and beating of Sam Rainsy Party supporters and scores of death threats and acts of armed aggression and intimidation. The Cambodian government has taken no action to prosecute anyone for these abuses or for the earlier killings. """"The international community has focused on the technical and logistical achievements of the electoral process only, largely ignoring their obligation to give an honest evaluation of the entire electoral process,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"They must now take steps to ensure that the post-election period is not also marred by violence and official impunity.""""","Asia, Cambodia",""

In recent weeks, the foreign ministers of two ASEAN governments, Thailand and the Philippines, have said that the notion of """"non-interference in the internal affairs"""" of member states had become outmoded and should be scrapped. Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan expressed concern about political instability in Burma and the prospect of a new influx of refugees, and urged ASEAN to develop an approach of """"flexible engagement.""""  """"ASEAN's credibility is at stake. Can it effectively address the crises in Burma, Cambodia, and Indonesia?"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Now that an open debate has begun within ASEAN on `constructive engagement,' how ASEAN handles these issues will be a test of its commitment to human rights.""""  Philippines Foreign Minister Domingo Saizon said ASEAN's policy of non-intervention will be on the agenda. He has called for urgent talks between the Burmese government and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi. Philippines officials have also been openly critical of Cambodia, noting that a coalition government might be the best outcome from the July 26th elections in order to head off the """"dictatorial tendencies"""" of any one party.  Cambodia's membership in ASEAN was delayed after the bloody coup in July 1997 staged by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen. Desperate for legitimacy, his government hopes that ASEAN membership might be approved either in Manila or at the next ASEAN ministerial meeting in September at the United Nations, in time for Cambodia to join the ASEAN leaders' summit in Hanoi this December. ASEAN governments have dispatched observers to the Cambodian elections slated for July 26.  Indonesian officials, meanwhile, will be meeting with Jakarta's major donors at an annual development aid conference convened by the World Bank in Paris on July 29-30, just days after the ASEAN gathering. President B.J. Habibie is struggling to resolve the country's economic and political crisis, including questions over the pace of political reforms, the impact of rapes and other attacks on ethnic Chinese during rioting in Jakarta and other cities in mid-May, the accountability of the army for human rights abuses, and rising tensions in East Timor and Irian Jaya.  Some ASEAN nations, including Indonesia, Burma, Laos and Vietnam, have publicly expressed alarm at any attempt to move away from consultation and consensus within ASEAN, clearly worried that a shift in approach would increase pressure for internal change. """"ASEAN can no longer afford to hide behind consensus as a way of avoiding political questions with wider regional implications,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.  Human Rights Watch urged ASEAN to play a constructive role in promoting good governance and the rule of law, which would help to restore donor and investor confidence in the region. It urged the ASEAN foreign ministers to consider the following specific initiatives at their July 24-25 meeting, and in discussions with the US, European Union, Japan, Canada, and other dialogue partners during the July 27-29 ASEAN Regional Forum and Post-Ministerial Conference:  On Burma, ASEAN should assign an envoy to work with all sides _ the Burmese military, the democratic opposition, and ethnic minority groups _ to explore how the recommendations of the UN Commission for Human Rights could be implemented, including release of political prisoners, an end to forced labor, and opening a political dialogue. Thailand, which recently signed a framework agreement with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), should be urged to make the details of the agreement public and restate its commitment to protect refugees fleeing persecution in Burma. ASEAN's partners should join member governments in urging Rangoon to end the growing confrontation with the National League for Democracy (NLD) by lifting internal travel restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi and elected NLD members of parliament.  On Cambodia, ASEAN should refrain from making a decision on Cambodia's bid for membership until it is clear that elections have been free and fair, and that there is a peaceful transition without violence and intimidation. ASEAN should also insist on action by the Cambodian government to investigate and prosecute extra-judicial killings documented by the UN, as the ASEAN troika urged in its June 20th statement in Bangkok. Meanwhile, the Friends of Cambodia _ composed of donor countries, ASEAN nations, China, and others _ should make it clear in any statement issued in Manila that they will withhold government-to-government aid and a decision on Cambodia's seat at the UN General Assembly until a legitimate elected government is installed.  On Indonesia, ASEAN should urge the Habibie government to take concrete action to address the fears of ethnic Chinese, such as by repealing all discriminatory laws and regulations and ensuring that acts of violence against ethnic Chinese are investigated and punished. It should also seek clarification of the precise timing of the announced election timetable, expressing concern about the economic effects of continuing political uncertainty. The ASEAN states should encourage the Indonesian government to reform its judicial system in order to create a fully independent judiciary. The Malaysian government should be urged to grant the UNHCR full access to immigration detention centers holding undocumented migrant workers with a possible claim to refugee status. ASEAN should join its partners in highlighting the role of Indonesian NGO's in monitoring the distribution of emergency aid, both bilateral and aid from the Asian Development Bank and World Bank.","Asia",""

It urged members of Congress, including members of the Senate Subcommittee on International Operations holding hearings today on the ICC, to study the treaty's provisions carefully, in light of atrocities taking place far outside the Beltway. It also demanded that U.S. officials refrain from uninformed and politically motivated criticism.     The U.S. was one of only seven countries to vote against the ICC treaty in Rome on July 17. The others were China, Iraq, Israel, Libya, Qatar, and Yemen. Virtually all of America's allies voted in favor of the court, which will prosecute future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.     """"Up to now, there's been no real disagreement between the administration and Congressional Republicans on the ICC,"""" said Richard Dicker, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch. """"The real fault line lies between the U.S. and 120 countries, including America's closest friends and allies, who voted for the treaty.""""     In Rome, the U.S. sought provisions to protect its own nationals that would also have allowed tyrants to shield themselves from prosecution, said Dicker. For example, the U.S. opposed allowing the ICC to have jurisdiction over suspected war criminals, if they are citizens of states that haven't ratified the treaty. Its amendment to that effect was defeated by an overwhelming majority on the final day of the conference. """"That loophole would have been big enough for Saddam Hussein to walk through -- and some of his Republican Guard, too,"""" said Dicker.     The U.S. also sought to avoid having to share intelligence with ICC investigations, and it tried to weaken the powers of the prosecutor. Unlike Britain and France, the U.S. tried to hang on to a United Nations Security Council veto over the court's docket. It was only partially successful in all these efforts.     """"The purpose of this court is to protect potential victims - people at risk for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes,"""" said Dicker. """"In its highly unpopular struggle to demand special superpower treatment, the U.S. lost sight of what this court is really all about. That's a sad legacy for President Clinton to leave behind.""""     Human Rights Watch noted that several of the questions being raised about the ICC reveal a lack of understanding about the treaty, and about widely accepted precepts of international law. Those questions include:     Is it unconstitutional for the U.S. government to extradite or surrender abroad U.S. citizens to be tried by foreign judges? The U.S. Constitution does not prohibit this. In fact, many U.S. nationals are sent abroad for trial before foreign courts every year. The ICC will attract some of the world's top legal experts, and is expected to maintain a higher standard of jurisprudence than many U.S. citizens routinely face in foreign courts today.     Will U.S. peacekeepers be subjected to unwarranted lawsuits at the ICC? No case can come before the ICC if a national court is already dealing competently with the matter. According to the treaty, the ICC has jurisidiction only if the prosecutor can prove that national courts have intent to shield suspects from prosecution. It's very, very difficult to imagine such a circumstance in the U.S. In addition, both the prosecutor, and a pretrial panel of judges, will review lawsuits to weed out any frivolous matters.     Can states that haven't ratified the treaty still be subject to its provisions? The ICC imposes no new obligations on states; the subjects of ICC prosecution will be individuals. There are many counter-terrorism treaties, for example, that allow foreigners to be prosecuted for crimes regardless of whether their government consents, and the U.S. is party to these treaties.","United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Gross human rights abuses in the fifteen-year war have caused and aggravated the famine in Bahr El Ghazal, the hardest-hit region in southern Sudan. The ceasefire should end abusive military strategies_such as targeting civilians and their cattle_that have stripped assets from the civilians, debilitated their survival coping mechanisms, and repeatedly displaced them.  Two parties to the fighting in Bahr El Ghazal especially need to be brought under control: the government-sponsored Arab tribal militia (muraheleen), and the forces of Cmdr.

Mission To Algeria Must Tackle Human Rights Issues","","07/20/1998","The United Nations mission arriving tomorrow in Algiers must focus on human rights if it is to succeed in its objective of assessing the overall situation in that country, Human Rights Watch declared today.  The office of Secretary-General's Kofi Annan has indicated that the delegation is not on a human rights mission per se. However, the circumstances surrounding the visit dictate that the delegation's handling of human rights will be closely watched. It will be arriving at a time when the government continues to deny the existence of a human rights problem and refuses entry to U.N. special human rights rapporteurs and to international human rights organizations, and is granting visas only selectively to journalists and hampering their movements while in the country.  The delegation's attention to human rights will also be judged in light of its being the first U.N. mission that Algeria has permitted since the Secretary-General and U.N. Human Rights Commissioner Mary Robinson declared publicly last year that the international community had a legitimate interest in Algeria's human rights situation.  """"With several thousand Algerians being assassinated each year, and hundreds of others being tortured or `disappeared,' the U.N. delegation must tackle human rights issues in a serious way if it wishes to be credible on the overall situation,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"At the same time, the U.N. must make clear that this visit by eminent personalities can in no way substitute for more in-depth visits by the U.N. special rapporteurs on Torture and on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions. The Algerians should stop impeding their access.""""  Secretary-General Annan announced the six-member mission on July 2. Led by Mario Soares, a former president of Portugal, the delegation is scheduled to spend two weeks in Algeria. Their report to the Secretary-General is to be made public.  Human Rights Watch believes that all of the issues listed below deserve consideration in any overall assessment of the situation in Algeria:  Targeting of civilians by armed groups. The delegation should travel outside of the capital to hear the testimony of survivors of, and witnesses to, attacks on civilians, or to arrange to meet them in Algiers. The delegation should itself choose the men and women it wishes to interview, subject to the agreement of the persons to be interviewed. It should insist on the complete confidentiality of interviews when requested, and describe in its final report any impediments to its soliciting and conducting private interviews.  Government failure to intervene effectively to stop mass killings. The government of Algeria has much to answer for, regardless of whether one gives credence to allegations of security-force involvement in the killing of civilians. Authorities have not credibly explained the failure of security forces to intervene to stop and apprehend groups of armed attackers who invaded rural hamlets and suburban neighborhoods, slaying scores and sometimes hundreds of unarmed civilians. These attacks sometimes occurred in proximity to security force barracks or outposts.  The delegation, with the assurances of access it has received, should conduct private interviews with witnesses, health-care professionals and others who can help the world community to understand these horrific events and how the state has responded to them.  Women as victims of political violence and discrimination. Militant groups in Algeria have, since before 1992, engaged in a campaign of intimidation and terror to force women to comply to with their own interpretation of Islamic law regarding dress, work, and education. Since 1993, scores of women have been assassinated, abducted, mutilated and raped by the armed groups.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria","United Nations"

High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson for maintaining the principle that monitoring is an appropriate and integral part of a U.N. human rights operation. The Rwandan government, which suspended the operation of the field office in May, sought to end the monitoring while keeping a U.N. presence only to assist in educational and technical capacities. The two international human rights organizations declared that the special case of Rwanda - a society recovering from the effects of the 1994 genocide and troubled by a serious insurgency - requires continued on site international investigation of the human rights situation. Rebel forces attack civilians regularly, most recently on July 12, when they slaughtered thirty-four persons at Tare, some twenty miles from the capital. The rebels include soldiers and militia from the forces responsible for the genocide. Rwandan government troops have also killed large numbers of civilians particularly in the northwest of the country. In addition, government and military authorities have taken into custody a growing number of persons suspected of ties with the rebels who are never seen or heard from again. In one such case, authorities reportedly removed dozens of persons from the Ruhengeri market and stadium on July 2. The Rwandan government claims that local human rights groups and a recently-established National Commission for Human Rights will report on any future abuses. But local groups lack the resources necessary even to observe the trials for persons accused of genocide being held all over the country and they rarely send investigators to combat zones. The National Commission has not yet begun to function and has no record of effective reporting on human rights violations.  Although the U.N. operation was also limited by lack of staff and by security considerations, it did produce regular reports on various subjects, including the conduct of military forces towards civilians and the functioning of the judicial system. At the time of its suspension, the human rights office was about to publish two reports describing the killing of civilians by government troops as well as by rebels in 1997 and the first quarter of 1998. Human Rights Watch and FIDH call upon the U.N. Human Rights Field Office to publish these reports before terminating its activities in Rwanda. In addition to monitoring the human rights situation, the field office contributed considerable technical assistance to the judicial system and to efforts to educate Rwandans about human rights.  The United States and the countries of the European Union have been anxious to assist the Rwandan government in rebuilding Rwanda, but they cannot responsibly do so without consideration for the human rights situation in the country. With the closing of the U.N. human rights office, reliable reporting on alleged abuses will be significantly reduced. This change will make scrutiny of human rights developments more difficult but certainly no less necessary.  In 1997, the Rwandan government persuaded the U.N. Human Rights Commission to end monitoring by a Special Rapporteur, arguing that this work was being done by the field operation. Human Rights Watch and FIDH urge that the U.N. High Commission for Human Rights restore the monitoring mandate to a Special Rapporteur now that the field operation has ended.","Africa, Rwanda","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/07/17/human-rights-watch-text-analysis-international-criminal-court-treaty","Human Rights Watch Text Analysis International Criminal Court Treaty","Human Rights Watch Text Analysis International Criminal Court Treaty","","07/17/1998","The following are some notable provisions of the ICC treaty, as      adopted by the Rome conference.       Crimes that the court can investigate and prosecute (Article 5) - The      court has jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war      crimes.  Fortunately, the treaty does give the court jurisdiction over      crimes committed in internal armed conflict - a provision strongly      opposed by the Arab League states, China, and India. But the list of      crimes for international war is much longer than that for civil war.      For example, the court can prosecute someone for indiscriminate      attacks against civilians, the starvation of civilians, or the use of      prohibited weapons such as biological weapons -- but only if those act      are committed in a war between states, not a civil war. Since almost      all conflicts today are """"non-international,"""" this limits the scope of      the court.    Several of the definitions of crimes go back on existing      international law. For example, it's well established that crimes      against humanity have to be """"widespread and systematic."""" The treaty      also requires that in addition, they must be committed as part of      """"state, organization, or group policy.""""     In an important victory, the court will be able to prosecute as a      war crime the use of children under the age of 15 as soldiers, or to      commit rape, sexual slavery, or enforced  pregnancy in the context of      war. Persecution on the basis of gender will be considered a crime      against humanity and a war crime.     The court will also have jurisdiction over the crime of aggression      if and when a definition is decided upon in the future. U.S. strongly      opposed including crimes of aggression in the treaty.       Restrictions on the court's jurisdiction (Articles 12, and 111 bis) -      A proposal that had won overwhelming support at the conference (the      """"Korean proposal"""") allowed prosecutions to go forward if one out of      four states had ratified the treaty: the state where the crimes took      place, the state of the accused person's nationality, the state of the      victim's nationality, and the state with custody of the accused.     In the final version of the treaty, the court cannot act unless the      state of nationality of the accused, or the state where the crimes      took place, have ratified the treaty. In practice, those two are very      likely to be the same state: Pol Pot, Idi Amin, Pinochet, and many      others committed atrocities on their own populations. This provision      will dramatically reduce the number of cases that the court can act      upon.    If the """"custodial state"""" had been included, tyrants could have been      captured while traveling outside their own countries. Under this      treaty, even a country that wants to turn over a suspect visiting its      territory will have no legal basis to do so.     If the state of nationality of the victim had been included, a      country could have submitted a case to the ICC if its citizens were      victims of these serious crimes in another country. An example would be      the Spaniards who were """"disappeared"""" in Argentina in the 1970's and      80's. Under this treaty, Spain would not have been able to file a suit      on their behalf.        """"Opt-out"""" for war crimes (Transitional Provision, Article 111 bis) - A      major  loophole, introduced at the eleventh hour by the permanent      members of the Security Council, will allow ratifying states to      declare that they """"opt out"""" of the court's jurisdiction for war crimes      for a period of seven years. States could not renew their """"opt out.""""      It's still unclear whether this provision will remain permanently in      the treaty, allowing any new member to """"opt out"""" when it joins.    This device incorporates impunity for war crimes into the founding      document of a court that's been established to prosecute these crimes.      That's illogical at best - and very damaging to the court's ability to      function. We expect that militaries will put tremendous pressure on      their governments to take this loophole. Human Rights Watch calls on      states not to take advantage of the """"opt-out"""" provision.                Independent prosecutor (Article 15) - This provision allows the ICC      prosecutor to undertake investigations on her own, subject to pre-trial      approval by a panel of judges who will determine whether there is a      reasonable basis for the investigations. The prosecutor can initiate      the investigation based on information from victims, non-governmental      organizations, or any other reliable source. The prosecutor and the      judges will be selected by the states that have ratified the treaty.      This proposal was highly controversial and staunchly opposed by the      United States.  Human Rights Watch considers its adoption to be a major      victory, because national governments and the U.N. Security Council      cannot be relied upon to bring matters to the court.       Role of the U.N. Security Council (Article 16) - At one time, all five      permanent members of the Security Council insisted that they should      have a veto over the court's docket. That proposal didn't fly.      Instead, the treaty includes the """"Singapore compromise,"""" by which the      Security Council may delay a prosecution for twelve months if it      believes the ICC would interfere with the Council's efforts to further      international peace and security. The Security Council must pass a      resolution requesting the court not to proceed; an individual      permanent member cannot block an investigation by exercising its veto.    However, the Security Council can renew its request indefinitely,      in twelve-month segments. This jeopardizes the court's independence,      but the Singapore Compromise takes the veto away from individual      permanent members.    The Security Council can refer matters to the court, and when it      does so, no state can block the ICC from proceeding - even states that      don't ratify the treaty.        Complementarity (Articles 17, 18, 19) - These important provisions are      at the heart of the relationship between the ICC and national judicial      systems, and won wide agreement. The ICC will only be able to try cases      when national courts have failed to work - where those courts have      acted in a way to shield the individual from criminal responsibility.      This ensures that the ICC will only operate in the most exceptional      circumstances, to fill the gap when national systems fail, not to      substitute itself for national authorities.        Criminal Law Provisions  (Articles 65, 66, 67, 68 and Article 32 ) -      In several important provisions, the treaty provides for full      protection of the right of accused persons to a fair trial, and for      the protection of victims and witnesses appearing before the Court.      At the same time, Human Rights Watch is concerned that certain      provisions represent a step back in international law. For example,      the statute allows a limited right to assert the existence of orders      from one's superior as a defense, although it has been clear since      Nuremberg that such orders cannot be a defense for committing serious      war crimes.          Reparations for victims (Article 73) - In a major step forward for      victims of atrocities, the court has broad powers to order convicted      persons to make reparations to victims. Those reparations can take      financial or symbolic form. Individual victims are entitled to      participate directly in the court's proceedings on reparations.       Duties of states to cooperate with the court (Article 90) - Since the      ICC will have no police force, it's entirely dependent on states to      investigate cases and transfer suspects to the court. The prosecutor      has very limited power to conduct investigations - she can't compel      witnesses or carry out exhumations, for example.    The treaty does require states to comply with the court's requests      for cooperation. However, there are two major exceptions. First, as a      result of U.S. and French insistence, the state may withhold      information or prevent an individual from giving evidence if, in the      state's view, it would prejudice national security interests. The U.S.      proposal prevailed over one from the U.K., which would have allowed      the court to order a state to disclose information, if it was acting      in bad faith. Second, a very vague provision could allow states not to      cooperate on the basis of inconsistency with their own """"fundamental      national law,"""" such as constitutional provisions.        No Reservations  (unnumbered article ) - In an important victory, the      treaty does not allow reservations. This means that, unlike with other      treaties, states cannot create loopholes to their obligations under      the ICC treaty by simply declaring that certain articles don't apply      to them - except for the war crimes """"opt-out"""" mentioned above, which      is incorporated into the body of the treaty itself.","Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Human Rights Watch today called on these delegations to stand by their principles and not capitulate to pressure by France and the United States to weaken the court.    The meeting, which ends on July 17, is creating a court to prosecute and punish individuals who in the future commit acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. In speeches to the conference over the last week, many African states have called for the court to have full jurisdiction over atrocities in civil wars, and the ability to investigate cases when any one of several interested states has ratified the court's statute. Many speakers have also supported an independent prosecutor who could initiate prosecutions on his or her own.     Those states include Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Congo (Brazzaville), Cote d'Ivoire, Djibouti, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Lesotho, Malawi, Madagascar, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zimbabwe. Only Sudan among sub-Saharan African states opposed giving the ICC broad jurisdiction over serious crimes, including those that arise from internal armed conflict.     """"The Africans have spoken out clearly in favor of an effective court,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"But we've come to the critical juncture at the ICC conference now, and the pressure from France and the United States is overwhelming. We call on these African states to stand firm against that pressure.""""     Some African delegates report that French government officials have called their capitals to pressure them to abandon their strong ICC positions. The U.S. has also been sending demarches to capitals around the world, and meeting with delegations in Rome, to insist that other countries modify their support for the ICC.     """"The U.S. and France are both seeking to insulate themselves from prosecution,"""" said Takirambudde. """"They want one system of justice for their own citizens, and another one for everyone else.""""     France wants to establish an """"opt-in"""" regime for the ICC, by which a state could ratify the treaty, but then declare itself outside the court's jurisdiction for war crimes.     In a statement last Thursday, the head of the United States delegation, Ambassador David Scheffer, stunned diplomats with the threat that the U.S. would """"actively oppose this Court"""" unless the U.S. prevailed in limiting the court's authority. Even if other countries succumb to U.S. demands, however, Scheffer did not say the U.S. would join the court. He only held out the promise that he """"could seriously consider favorably recommending to the United States Government that it sign the ICC treaty at an appropriate time in the future.""""     Reuters reported yesterday that in a meeting with the German defense minister, the U.S. defense secretary threatened to review U.S. troop levels in Europe if the Germans did not back off their position on the court's broad jurisdiction.","Africa","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

The UN Human Rights Committee is the treaty-monitoring body of the ICCPR. It will meet today in Geneva to discuss Israel's report on its implementation of the Covenant. Israel's initial report has been overdue since January 1993.  """"This report seriously misrepresents Israel's human rights record,"""" said Hanny Megally, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division. """"Israel doesn't report on the occupied territories, and its discussion of the ICCPR's implementation inside of Israel is filled with misleading and inaccurate statements.""""  Megally also noted that on the question of administrative detention -- the practice of holding individuals without charging them -- Israel's report deals with only a tiny fraction of the relevant cases. Almost all of the 1,900 administrative orders issued in 1997 were issued under military orders in the occupied territories, and not under Israel domestic law.  Israel has tried to argue that it should not be required to report on the occupied territories. But in its submission, Human Rights Watch shows that in other cases before the Human Rights Committee, States have been held responsible for the actions of their agents, even outside their national territory. Other treaty-monitoring bodies have also required Israel to report on the occupied territories. Human Rights Watch believes that Israel's obligations under the ICCPR extend to the territories under its control in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights, and South Lebanon.  Human Rights Watch also challenged Israel's use of the ICCPR's state of emergency clause to excuse instances of arbitrary arrest or detention. Israel has used prolonged administrative detention to hold individuals hostage, as a means of punishing non-violent political expression and activity, and as a substitute for bringing suspects to trial. In March 1998, Israel made public an Israeli Supreme Court decision allowing Israel to continue holding a group of Lebanese citizens as """"bargaining chips,"""" even though the Court acknowledged that the detainees were not themselves a threat to state security.  """"The state of emergency clause does not allow states to violate international law,"""" said Megally. """"Israel's use of administrative detention to hold hostages is a blatant violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. International law categorically prohibits hostage-taking in wartime. Neither Israel nor the Committee can condone its use during a state of emergency.""""  Human Rights Watch also rejected Israel's characterization of its domestic law as prohibiting the use of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and providing effective oversight of detention and interrogation practices. The treaty-monitoring body of the Convention against Torture has twice found Israel's interrogation practices to violate that Convention.  Finally, Human Rights Watch criticized Israel's High Court for abstaining from ruling on whether specific interrogation practices are cruel, inhuman, or degrading. The Court also routinely accepts the State's position that the use of physical force in interrogation is justified to obtain urgently needed information in order to save lives or property.  Human Rights Watch called on the Committee to recommend that Israel incorporate the ICCPR's provisions into domestic law; immediately end the practice of torture and make public the guidelines governing interrogation procedures; and immediately end the practice of holding detainees as hostages and release all persons held as """"bargaining chips."""" Human Rights Watch also proposed a series of revisions to Israeli law that would be necessary to ensure that administrative detainees' treatment meets minimum international standards.

The U.N. statement condemned massacres and other crimes against humanity committed in 1996-97 in the former Zaire, currently the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), but it stopped short of authorizing an independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible for these crimes. """"Simply calling on the Congolese and Rwandan governments to investigate and prosecute their own officials makes no sense,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, the Africa Director of Human Rights Watch. """"It's an insult to the victims. Both governments have already failed to cooperate with previous U.N. probes of these crimesThe Security Council has promised to review the issue again in three months.  The June 30 report by the Secretary-General's investigative team (SGIT) concludes that the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo, and its Rwandan and other allies, committed massacres of displaced Rwandan Hutus, including thousands of women and children, during the swift 1996-97 military campaign that installed President Kabila in power in the DRC. The report asserts that these massacres and the denial of humanitarian assistance to displaced Rwandan Hutus were """"systematic practices involving murder and extermination, which constitute crimes against humanity."""" These were cold-blooded murders of thousands of unarmed people. The SGIT, whose probe was frustrated by DRC obstruction, has recommended that the next step is identifying the killers and bringing them to justice.  The SGIT has suggested, in particular, that an appropriate judicial body, possibly the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, be endowed with the authority to investigate these tragic events and to determine individual responsibility for them. In letters to member states of the Security Council in advance of last night's meeting, Human Rights Watch has endorsed this recommendation as the most effective means to punish those guilty of violations.  Alternatively, the Security Council could create an independent Commission of Inquiry with the resources to establish individual and command responsibility for the massacres. This would include fact-finding and political and military intelligence capabilities. States which contributed troops to the military campaign to overthrow Mobutu, as well as those with information, would be expected to cooperate with the investigation. The commission of investigation or the appropriate tribunal could pursue these key questions from outside the DRC and, if the government of the DRC decides to cooperate, from inside the country as well.  """"Unfortunately, the Security Council has made its choice, and it's a bad one,"""" said Takirambudde. He urged the Security Council to commission an independent investigation and prosecution of these crimes, since the Congolese and Rwandan governments are likely to prove, three months from today, as unwilling as ever to assume their responsibilities in accounting for these massacres.  Mr. Takirambudde noted that the Congo crisis has underscored the need for an International Criminal Court (ICC) with permanent responsibility for investigating and prosecuting precisely these types of crimes. """"The case of Congo shows that you can't rely on the Security Council to dispense justice,"""" he said. Delegates at the conference to establish an ICC in Rome have come under heavy pressure from the United States and other governments to weaken the court's powers, and to allow the Security Council to have some control over the court's docket. Mr. Takirambudde urged the nations of Africa and other regions of the world to withstand such pressure and create an independent and effective ICC.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","International Justice, United Nations"

The minority comprises powers such as the United States, Russia and China, as well as states traditionally hostile to international human rights mechanisms, such as Iraq, Nigeria and Indonesia.     In a statement last Thursday, the head of the United States delegation, Ambassador David Scheffer, stunned diplomats with the threat that the U.S. would """"actively oppose this Court"""" unless the U.S. prevailed in limiting the court's authority. """"In the face of blatant blackmail by the United States, which will not ratify the statute in any event, we look to the like-minded group to stand fast,"""" said Dicker. """"The success of this conference rests in the commitment of those states and others who will join them.""""     Even if other countries succumb to U.S. demands, Scheffer did not say the U.S. would join the court. He only held out the promise that he """"could seriously consider favorably recommending to the United States Government that it sign the ICC treaty at an appropriate time in the future."""" """"That's a long way away from actual ratification,"""" noted Dicker. """"No one is holding their breath.""""     In the debate, 62 countries took the floor to call for an independent prosecutor who can initiate cases, while only 25 countries sought to restrict cases to those referred by states and the Security Council. Sixty-six countries would allow the court to take up most cases when any one of several concerned states had ratified the court's statute, while some 18 delegations would bar the court from acting unless specified states had consented.     The following key issues remain to be decided:     1. An independent prosecutor: Some states (19), such as the U.S., China and Russia, maintain that the prosecutor should have to wait for states or the UN Security Council to bring cases to the ICC. States are notoriously reluctant, however, to register complaints against other states, so many crimes will go unpunished under this system. A majority (61) of countries have therefore have suggested that the prosecutor should be empowered to initiate an investigation based on information from any source, including individuals and non-governmental organizations.     2. The court's jurisdiction: According to various proposals (cumulatively backed by 18 states), the Court could take up crimes against humanity and serious war crimes only when certain states (the state with custody over the accused, the state of the accused's nationality or the state where the crime took place) have ratified the statute. Most states (66), however, have rallied to a South Korean proposal giving the court jurisdiction when any one of these states have ratified the treaty. Twenty (20) states argue that a ratifying state still must give its consent to particular cases or classes of cases, which would effectively paralyze the court. Sixty-four (64) states hold that once a state ratifies the treaty, it consents to all cases.     3. The role of the Security Council: Only China and Russia still insist on allowing the permanent members of the Security Council to veto the Court's jurisdiction -- and thereby manipulate the docket -- if the Council is already """"dealing with"""" a situation that concerns international peace and security. The overwhelming majority -- including the United Kingdom and France -- support that """"Singapore proposal"""": the Security Council, acting affirmatively, could tell the court to delay any prosecutions for a period of time if it believed this was necessary for the promotion of peace and international security. The United States announced Thursday that it was willing to consider this proposal despite its dissatisfaction with it.     4. Internal armed conflict: A few states, such as India and Mexico, argue that the Court's jurisdiction over crimes committed in internal conflicts should be very limited, ignoring the reality that most contemporary wars are fought within states, not between states. Nine (9) countries, including the United States and China, seek to limit the Court's jurisdiction over war crimes to those committed pursuant to a """"plan or policy,"""" thus excluding many serious massacres. A majority of states wants the Court to have full jurisdiction over war crimes in civil wars.","Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

He insisted that a suspect's own government should be required to ratify the ICC treaty before the Court could investigate any national of that country. In a remarkably blunt address, Scheffer also reiterated U.S. opposition to an independent ICC prosecutor who could initiate cases, arguing that only states or the Security Council should be allowed to refer cases to the court. Most delegations in Rome support the independent prosecutor.     """"This is a new low in the Clinton Administration's approach to the ICC,"""" said Richard Dicker, who leads the ICC campaign for Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"It is outrageous that the US is trying to force other states to choose: either they keep the US happy and create a meaningless court, or they establish an effective institution and risk American efforts to sabotage it.""""     Today the US also proposed a two-tier jurisdictional system under which the ICC would only have automatic jurisdiction over genocide. For crimes against humanity and war crimes, which will form the great bulk of the ICC's docket, states that have already ratified the treaty could then still decide whether to allow the Court to bring cases against their nationals. The American proposal differs from the position that a majority of delegations in Rome support: that once states ratify the treaty, they automatically accept the Court's jurisdiction for all core crimes.     """"The system proposed by the United States reduces the act of ratifying the treaty to a photo opportunity for states,"""" said Dicker. """"It would allow states to ratify the treaty, but still prevent the Court from pursuing most investigations if they prove politically embarrassing to the state.""""     US opposition to an independent prosecutor is also a minority position. """"Unless the prosecutor can initiate cases, this court will be dependent on political decisions by states and the Council and thus will be powerless to investigate many serious crimes,"""" said Dicker. """"We know from experience that states rarely file complaints, and the Security Council reacts only selectively.""""     The US finds itself in the company of a minority of states opposed to an effective Court, including Russia, China, Iraq, Libya, India and Mexico. A growing majority of states, including the 60-member """"like-minded"""" group comprising Canada, Australia and virtually all European countries, as well as key democracies such as South Korea, South Africa, Senegal, Argentina and Chile, support a court with an independent prosecutor, full jurisdiction over war crimes in internal armed conflicts, free from Security Council control and with the ability to investigate cases when any one of several interested states has ratified the court's statute.     The ICC will be different from the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which addresses only disputes between states, and different from the ad-hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, which are temporary and involve only specific countries. The International Criminal Court will be a permanent forum to prosecute and punish individuals who commit egregious human rights violations.     The establishment of an effective ICC will be a significant milestone in the enforcement of human rights worldwide.

Little over a week remains before the five week meeting closes on July 17.     Human Rights Watch also criticized the United Kingdom's """"restrictive view"""" on the preconditions for the exercise of the ICC's authority. Britain is insisting that for the court to try a case, the state on whose territory the crimes have occurred must have ratified the treaty establishing the ICC.

Over the last year the British government has supported proposals that would make the proposed ICC more independent and effective. These include opposition to a veto over the court's docket by permanent members of the Security Council, a constructive approach to war crimes in internal armed conflicts and to national security claims by states, and sensitivity to gender concerns. """"We look to the UK to continue to evolve in a positive direction,"""" said Dicker.     The ICC will be different from the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which addresses only disputes between states, and different from the ad-hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, which are temporary and involve only specific countries.

Human rights investigators in Biak say that families of people wounded or detained in the July 6 attack are being denied access to the hospitals and lock-ups where they are being held. Because of the lack of access, they said, many families are worried that their children are dead or missing. They said intelligence operatives have been stationed in different neighborhoods around Biak, questioning friends and relatives of known protestors. Villagers who helped feed the demonstrators during their four-day demonstration are among those detained. Investigators said that of the more than 200 arrested, 140 were still detained and were being held at three places, the police headquarters, the district military command, and a navy complex. One of the leaders of the protest, a man named Yopie Karma, was said to be detained at police headquarters in Biak, even though he had been shot in the feet and required medical treatment. His family had been summoned to the headquarters for questioning, but as of July 8, had not been allowed to see him. Eyewitness accounts said many of the wounded had been roughly picked up by troops and dumped into a container truck which was then driven to the navy hospital. Hospital officials appeared to be under orders not to give information to journalists or human rights workers about the number of dead or wounded. Human Rights Watch was told, however, that one man, Elias Ansek, aged fifty-four, who had been shot in the stomach, died in Biak General Hospital on Tuesday. Unconfirmed reports suggested that some of those detained had been tortured, including an eleven-year-old boy named Manuel Air, reported to have been cut with a razor.

In discussions with Human Rights Watch, they said that the office of district head (bupati) was being contested by a civilian and a military officer, and that evidence of separatist activity in the district would help the military candidate make the case to Jakarta that a military presence was needed. In the demonstration, about 1,000 demonstrators raised the banned flag of West Papua, the name given by nationalists to Irian Jaya, on a flagpole in front of the district council, where it flew from 4:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. before it was taken down by security forces. The leader of the demonstration, Yan Manuel Menay, aged sixty-two, said he would ensure the demonstrators left peacefully if local officials allowed the flag to fly until 6:00 p.m., which they did.

International organizations in Foca have received threats and been the targets of violence.   Foca lies in the territory controlled by French troops of the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR). Until the June 15 arrest of Milorad Krnojelac, those troops had failed to arrest any of the indicted suspects living in Foca. In its report, Human Rights Watch urges the arrest of other indicted war criminals in Foca, and the investigation of individuals who were allegedly involved in wartime abuses.   Human Rights Watch also calls upon international donor governments and institutions to withhold reconstruction aid from Foca until those allegedly responsible for abuses are brought to justice. Donors and investors in the Foca area include the European Union, the Italian government, the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.   """"Donors have not been careful enough to ensure that war criminals and other enemies of peace are not benefiting politically and financially from their largesse,"""" said Cartner.

The Human Rights Watch report, """"'A Closed, Dark Place': Past and Present Human Rights Abuses in Foca ,"""" traces the history of the town since the Serb takeover in April 1992, when its population stood at about 40,000. At that time, local authorities established a """"Crisis Committee"""" to coordinate the Serb military and police in their campaign of """"ethnic cleansing"""": detaining, arresting, expelling, raping, torturing, and murdering the non-Serb population. Foca became known as the site of """"rape camps"""" where non-Serb women were detained and abused.

The cities are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles , Minneapolis, New Orleans, New York, Philadelphia, Portland, Providence, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. """"Police departments like to claim that each high-profile abuse is an aberration, committed by a `rogue' officer,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of the New York-based Human Rights Watch. """"But these human rights violations persist because the accountability systems are so defective."""" Abuses such as unjustified shootings, severe beatings, fatal chokings, and other forms of brutal physical treatment have been reported in cities throughout the United States. These abuses, and officials' unwillingness to curtail them, are violations of international human rights treaties by which the United States is bound. They are also violations of most police departments' policies, and state and federal law. Furthermore, they are a betrayal of the public these officers are sworn to serve. Data on police abuse is very hard to obtain. Internal affairs units operate under a cloak of secrecy and are reluctant to release even basic information about their activities. In 1994, Congress instructed the Justice Department to compile statistics and produce an annual report on the use of excessive force nationwide. Nearly four years later, no such report has been published. Human Rights Watch offers the following recommendations for reform:  making federal aid to police departments conditional on regular reporting about the use of excessive force, and on improvements in oversight and discipline creating, among police and political leaders, a policy of zero tolerance for abuses establishing early warning systems to identify """"at-risk"""" officers and remove those who commit abuses providing adequate funding and political support for civilian review agencies hiring special prosecutors in each state to handle criminal prosecutions of police.  In the cities where such data are available, minorities have alleged human rights violations by police more frequently than white residents, and far out of proportion to their representation in those cities. Police have subjected minorities to apparently discriminatory treatment and have physically abused minorities while using racial epithets. The Abner Louima case in New York last year, in which a Haitian immigrant claimed officers sodomized him with a stick and beat him, shocked the world. The officers who knew what happened were unwilling to report the incident immediately or to come forward with information later, and the alleged perpetrators apparently believed that they would get away with this egregious act even though it took place in a busy station house. """"While many American cities, and even foreign countries, look to New York as a model of effective policing, the city also offers a model of how not to run a system of accountability,"""" said Roth. Habitually brutal officers - usually a small percentage of officers on a force - may be the subject of repeated complaints but are usually protected by the silence of their fellow officers and by substandard internal police investigations. Their violent histories emerge, and are addressed, only after they commit an abuse that is so flagrant, so unavoidably embarrassing, that it cannot be ignored. And even if the individual officer is appropriately disciplined eventually, the officer's superiors - who should have intervened to curtail the abuses - typically escape scrutiny or any disciplinary actions. In practice, civil lawsuits actually allow police departments to ignore abuses committed by officers. Damages paid to victims do not come from the budget of the police department or officer personally: in almost all cases, the city pays any settlement or jury award. In most cities, no investigation is triggered by the filing, the settlement or the judgment relating to a lawsuit against an officer, no matter how severe the allegation. The officer's performance evaluations are usually unaffected. Criminal prosecution of police officers is rare. Local prosecutors are reluctant to pursue cases against officers accused of human rights violations because they typically work closely with police to prosecute criminals. Winning such cases can be difficult, due to victims who may be criminals themselves and many juries' tendency to believe police accounts. Federal prosecution of officers under criminal civil rights statutes is also rare. In Fiscal Year 1996, for example, out of 11,721 total complaints received by the Justice Department's civil rights division, only thirty-seven cases involving law enforcement officials were presented to a grand jury, with a total of twenty-nine convictions or pleas. """"Local and federal prosecutors just aren't doing the job of going after officers accused of human rights violations,"""" said Roth. """"State governments need to appoint special prosecutors if they want to address these terrible crimes.""""","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/07/06/indonesia-alert-trouble-irian-jaya","Indonesia Alert- Trouble In Irian Jaya","Indonesia Alert: Trouble In Irian Jaya","","07/06/1998","Human Rights Watch said today that the explosion of violence over the weekend in Irian Jaya, Indonesia's easternmost province, underscored the need to take urgent measures to prevent further human rights violations there. On July 6, the army shot rubber bullets into a crowd of pro-independence protestors in Biak, wounding fifteen; there are unconfirmed reports that one of them died. On July 3, two student demonstrators were shot near the Cenderawasih University campus in Jayapura after students beat up and gravely injured a police intelligence agent. The plainclothes policeman is reported to have died; one of the two students is in critical condition in a Jayapura hospital. The shootings came after a month of protests against military abuses and demonstrations in support of independence for West Papua, as nationalists call the territory that has been an Indonesian province since 1969 In post-Soeharto Indonesia, there should be room for peaceful assembly and expression in support of any political cause,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Indonesian leaders may be worried about calls for independence of Irian Jaya, but they need to understand the depth of resentment there at the way the province has been administered. If local and national government officials had undertaken a serious dialogue with influential public figures, church leaders, and representatives of human rights organizations in Irian Jaya, the deaths and injuries of the last few days might have been averted."""" She called on Indonesian troops to abide by the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. The U.N. principles state among other things that security forces should exercise restraint and use firearms only in self-defense or """"defense of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury [...]and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives.""""  Human rights defenders contacted by Human Rights Watch said the wave of protests was sparked in part by a letter sent to Indonesian President B.J. Habibie by fifteen United States congressmen on May 22, 1998. The letter, widely circulated in Irian Jaya, called on Habibie to initiate """"direct good faith dialogues with the peoples of East Timor and Irian  Jaya on human rights and a just solution to their political status."""" Many of the protesters interpreted the letter as meaning that in the context of reforms taking place in Indonesia more generally, the U.S. government would back peaceful moves for independence.  In the aftermath of the army shootings, church leaders and human rights groups have sought troop withdrawals from the province as well as a dialogue between leaders of the demonstrations and provincial civilian and military leaders to discuss the political aspirations of the populace. In 1995, the Irian Jaya regional command drew widespread domestic and international praise for issuing human rights guidelines for its troops. Local newspapers reprinted those guidelines in June as more and more information about military abuses surfaced.  Key incidents of the past six weeks included the following: On May 25 three religious leaders from Irian Jaya, Father Nato Gobay, Rev. ABM Hutapea, and Rev. Isak Onowame, presented a report on human rights violations stemming from military operations in the Mapnduma area of Irian Jaya to Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission (Komnas HAM). The report documented sixteen killings, """"disappearances,"""" and widespread destruction of homes and church buildings by Indonesian army troops. The abuses took place during military operations led by the army special forces (Kopassus) to capture leaders of the armed independence movement known as the Free Papua Movement (Organisasi Papua Merdeka or OPM). The operations were launched after the military released a group of Indonesian and foreign wildlife researchers taken hostage by the OPM in 1996. Most of the killings occurred in 1997 near the villages of Bella and Alama in the Central Highlands region, but troops were active in the area through early 1998. The religious leaders requested a full investigation and urged that henceforth the regional military command based in Irian Jaya be staffed solely with Irianese troops, rather than by Javanese and soldiers from elsewhere in Indonesia who did not understand or appreciate the local culture.  On May 28 and 29, demonstrations took place in front of the provincial parliament building, led by a coalition called the """"Group Concerned about Human Rights in Irian Jaya"""" (Kelompok Peduli HAM Irja) and a student group called Solidarity Forum of Irian Jaya Students. They demanded that troops be pulled out of the Central Highlands, that those responsible for abuses be prosecuted, and that more attention be given human rights issues by local officials. Students from Irian Jaya and elsewhere also demonstrated in front of the Defense Ministry in Jakarta on May 29. On June 11, Komnas sent one fact-finding team to the area and a second on June 29.  On June 17, three non-Irianese transmigrants working for a palm oil plantation in Arso, outside Jayapura, were shot and killed in the early evening by gunmen whom local military commanders immediately labeled as OPM; their actual identity is far from certain, and one church leader noted that any time someone was killed in Arso, a large transmigrant area, it was always blamed on guerrillas. A fourth transmigrant remains missing. There is widespread skepticism about the army's claim that the gunmen were rebels; church leaders noted it was odd that just as demands were increasing for soldiers to be withdrawn, an incident would occur that might justify their continued presence.  On June 21, students from the Central Highlands region studying in East Java demanded that the pool of candidates for district head (bupati) of Jayawijaya, the district where most of the killings documented in the May 25 report took place, be entirely drawn from civilians. The bupati is to be chosen this year for a five-year term, and of thirty candidates, seven are military men.  On June 22, about one hundred members of a group called Communications Forum of the Younger Generation of Irian Jaya (Forum Komunikasi Generasi Muda Irian Jaya or FKGMI) demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Justice office in Jakarta demanding that political prisoners from Irian Jaya be freed. Justice Minister Muladi invited the group in to discuss the issue. He told the demonstrators that he did not have the authority to order the releases but would convey their concerns to the next meeting of Cabinet members responsible for security and political affairs.  On July 1-3, a series of demonstrations in support of West Papuan independence took place around the Irian Jayan towns of Jayapura, Sorong, Biak, and Nabire. On July 1, hundreds of demonstrators converged on the provincial parliament building in Jayapura that was being tightly guarded by anti-riot forces of the mobile police brigade. Parliament members refused to meet them, saying their demands for self-determination were political, and they could not respond. In support of their demands, the demonstrators pointed to the May 22 letter from U.S. congressmen noted above. Just after midnight, the anti-riot forces forced the demonstrators to disperse. About one hundred returned the next morning, July 2, but anti-riot troops blocked their way to the parliament building. Clashes broke out between stone-throwing youths and troops who reportedly used nightsticks to beat up anyone they could reach. Blocked from getting to the parliament, the youths began going after a local store, Toko Soni, and other buildings. Three people were detained. A second clash took place around noon near the Overtoom bridge in Jayapura, in which ten people were injured, none seriously, and three more people detained. Around 2 p.m., the demonstrators, with the agreement of the police, sent five people to meet with the Jayapura police commander, but when they did not return, their friends assumed they had been arrested and further clashes broke out. Demonstraters stoned several more buildings, including a savings bank and the provincial office of the Ministry of Communications. Any non-Papuan who approached was taunted, stoned, or beaten, according to one account. By the end of the day, forty-one people had been detained.  On July 2, thousands of young people calling themselves Reform Forum of Students and the People of Sorong (Forum Reformasi Mahasiswa dan Masyarakat Sorong Irian Jaya) took part in a pro-independence demonstration in front of the district council of Sorong. They presented nine demands to the council in a document called """"Political Position Statement."""" The nine included support for the proclamation of the independence of West Papua in July 1971; the granting of independence to West Papua as quickly as possible by President Habibie; immediate release of West Papuan political prisoners detained in Kalisosok Prison, Surabaya, Pamekasan Prison, Madura, and Cipinang Prison, Jakarta; withdrawal of Indonesian troops and all Indonesian people from West Papua; observance of the Rome promises made by former President Soeharto; attention to the letter from American senators dated May 22, 1998 and appeal dated May 26, 1998 from the U.S. Senate to the government of Indonesia regarding self-determination for the people of West Papua; review of the U.N.-supervised """"Act of Free Choice"""" undertaken in 1969 in West Irian; cancelling of all political statements from Irian Jaya that indicate that West Papua is under Indonesian adminstration; and the immediate dispatch of a team from the National Human Rights Commission to meet with the demonstrators in Sorong. When their appeals went unheeded, they began using violence, burning the district council building and several stores as well as the car belonging to the district head. As troops arrived, five people were reportedly shot; the crowd then attacked the district military commander, Lt. Col. Nico Obaja Woru, who had to be hospitalized.  The demonstration that led to the shootings of the two students on July 3 began as students from Cenderawasih University held an """"open forum"""" (mimbar bebas) on the campus in Abepura, a suburb of Jayapura. Trouble broke out after students spotted an intelligence agent from the local police sitting under a tree. According to reports, a group of students grabbed his identity card, confirmed that he was from intelligence, and began beating him up. They also took his pistol. The agent, Sgt. Dahlan (given as Dadang in the Jayapura papers) was initially listed in critical condition in a Jayapura hospital, and one newspaper reported he had died on Saturday. As word of the beating reached security forces, trucks full of anti-riot and regular army troops came into Abepura. Demonstrators were massed outside the campus on the main road and began throwing stones at the trucks. It was at this point that troops fired warning shots, according to the regional military commander. Soldiers then apparently opened fire into the crowd. A law student, Steven Suripatti, and a high school student, Corina Ruth Onim, were seriously wounded. Suripati appeared to have been hit in the head by a regular bullet, although the military maintained they were using only blanks and rubber bullets; he was in critical condition in a Jayapura hospital. Ms. Onim, who was shot in the knees, was expected to recover. Suripatti was reportedly on the Cenderawasih campus when he was hit; Corina Onim was on the campus of the Iskijne Technical High School nearby.  On July 5, Major General Sembiring, the regional military commander, apologized for the shootings and promised to investigate them; he said he did not know who fired the actual shots.  On July 6, the military opened fire on demonstrators in Biak. On July 2, they had raised the """"Morning Star"""" flag, the symbol of West Papua, over a water tower near the harbor in Biak where it remained for the next three days, guarded by some 700 demonstrators. At about 5:30 a.m. on July 6, two navy vessels unloaded marines at Biak harbor and about 130 troops from the 733rd infantry battalion of the regional military command were dropped by Hercules helicopter. The circumstances under which the troops opened fire is not clear; Biak has been all but closed off by the military for the last three days. Human rights defenders in Jayapura reported that families of those wounded were having great difficulty getting news of their relatives, let alone access to them. Hundreds were said to have been detained.  Irian Jaya constitutes the western half of the island of New Guinea. As part of the Dutch East Indies, the territory was known as West Irian and was claimed as part of Indonesia by Indonesian nationalists in their war against the Dutch. Unlike the rest of the former Dutch East Indies, however, West Irian remained under Dutch control after Indonesia secured its independence in 1949, and the Dutch prepared the territory to become a separate state. In 1961, a West Papuan Council was elected, a national anthem composed, and a flag designed, and 1970 was set as the date for independence. On October 1, 1962, however, after heavy U.S. pressure, the Dutch turned West Irian over to an interim U.N. administration. Indonesia sent troops into the territory in 1963 and, in what many regarded as a brutal military operation, laid the groundwork for a farcical """"Act of Free Choice"""" in 1969 that was anything but free, and in which 1,026 """"elders"""" were selected to vote on the territory's political status under heavy Indonesian military surveillance. The resulting vote to become part of Indonesia was formalized when West Irian became the province of Irian Jaya on September 10, 1969.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Takirambudde said the U.N. and other international bodies should monitor prisoner releases closely. """"General Abdulsalam Abubakar should also announce an early date for the military to leave office,"""" said Takirambudde, """"and ensure that a genuinely elected government is installed in Nigeria at the earliest date.""""  Human Rights Watch has called for the international community to establish a set of clear benchmarks for Nigeria to respect before sanctions adopted by the European Union, United States, Commonwealth and others should be lifted. These include not only the release of political prisoners, but also the repeal of certain key repressive decrees, respect for freedom of the media, and, most importantly, the holding of genuinely free and fair elections. These benchmarks are even more important now that the Nigerian government is showing signs of sensitivity to international opinion.  Human Rights Watch also cautioned that the release of political prisoners should be carefully monitored to ensure that all known prisoners are indeed released. These would include not only Chief Moshood Abiola, presumed winner of the 1993 elections, but also twenty Ogoni activists held in prison since 1994 in connection with the same charges as those for which Ken Saro-Wiwa and his codefendants were hanged; several journalists, including Moshood Fayewmiwo, Adetokunbo Fakeye, Rafiu Salau, Babafemi Ojudu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi, and Kunle Ajibade; and a Muslim leader Sheikh El Zak Zaky and others charged with sedition. Several tens of military officers convicted of involvement in alleged coup plots in 1995 and 1997 also remain in prison.

Although the DRC government systematically obstructed the work of the Secretary General's Investigative Team (SGIT), and the team had its own internal difficulties, the investigators were able to confirm that troops loyal to Kabila perpetrated gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the then-Republic of Zaire. The SGIT's report concluded that Kabila's troops may have committed """"crimes against humanity"""" as they hunted down and killed hundreds of unarmed Rwandan civilians who were fleeing refugee camps under attack.   Human Rights Watch also commended the U.N. report for providing evidence that the Rwandan government may share responsibility for these heinous crimes. The report concluded that, in May 1997, hundreds of unarmed Hutu refugees were massacred in the town of Mbandaka by soldiers of Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (ADFL), operating """"under apparent Rwandan Army (RPA) command."""" In a report last October (""""What Kabila is Hiding: Civilian Killings and Impunity in Congo""""), Human Rights Watch also concluded that Rwandan troops had a role in some of the killings of Rwandan Hutu refugees on Zairean territory.   """"The international community has yet to probe the role of Rwanda and other regional allies of the ADFL in these killings,"""" noted Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. He called on the United Nations and the international community to continue the inquiry into the refugee massacres, to identify more precisely the individuals responsible for the killings, and to bring them to justice.

In a June 24 statement, the DRC government summarily rejected the findings of the U.N. investigation.

Attacks on civilians and the systematic destruction of villages have effectively cleansed Kosovo's western region of ethnic Albanians.Human Rights Watch has strong evidence of summary executions and rape. At the same time, the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA) has detained at least thirty Serb civilians and allegedly forced many others from their homes. As the conflict continues, abuses by the KLA seem to be increasing   Human Rights Watch recently completed a four-week fact-finding mission in Kosovo and Northern Albania. A detailed report will be published soon, but some of the preliminary findings include:   Powerful evidence that Serbian police forces summarily executed ethnic Albanians in the villages of Likosane and Cirez (Feb. 28-March 1), Prekaz (March 5-6), Poklek (May 31), and Ljubenic (May 30). Eyewitnesses report the rape of three women in Ljubenic.   The JNA and Serbian special police have fired on civilians fleeing their homes in the western region, including those attempting to cross the border into Albania. Helicopters marked with the red cross have shot at refugees near the Albanian border on at least two occasions in early June. A large number of ethnic Albanians have been detained throughout Kosovo over the past two months. The precise number is impossible to determine because Serbian officials do not disclose the names or locations of those taken into custody. Doctor Hafir Shala has been missing since April 10, when he was taken into custody by the police near Slatina. Zahrida Podrimcaku, a local human rights activist, was arrested in Prishtina on June 8, one hour after speaking with a Human Rights Watch researcher, and charged with committing terrorist acts.   Access is still severely restricted in the western area of Kosovo for journalists and humanitarian aid organizations. Aside from blocking much needed food and medical supplies, restricted access prevents outside experts from investigating human rights violations, including allegations of a mass detention center in the Dekor company near Decan and a possible mass grave in the nearby forest.   The international community has issued strong statements but failed to apply the pressure that would convince President Slobodon Milosevic to stop his abusive campaign. With Serbian forces beginning what looks like a major offensive near Obilic, it is critical for the United States and the international community to exert strong and sustained pressure on the Yugoslav leadership. Non-military options include: the economic isolation of Milosevic and Yugoslavia's military establishment and full financial and logistical support for the War Crimes Tribunal on the Former Yugoslavia, whose mandate covers Kosovo.   At the same time, the international community should condemn the increasing number of humanitarian law violations committed by the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA). Human Rights Watch has documented some violations, including detentions of and attacks on Serbian civilians, as well as the KLA siege of Kijevo, which effects civilians and other non-combatants in the town. Since Kosovo is an internal armed conflict, both government forces and the KLA are obliged to respect, at a minimum, the provisions of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which require that civilians and other protected persons be treated humanely, with specific prohibitions on murder, torture, or cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Although most recruits are over 15 years of age, significant recruitment starts at 10 years, and the use of even younger children has been recorded.  Current international standards allow children as young as 15 to be recruited into armed forces and participate in hostilities. A small number of countries have blocked efforts through a UN working group to raise the age to 18.

The coalition is working in close cooperation with the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and key UN agencies and bodies. The Coalition is campaigning in favor of an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child which would ban the recruitment and participation in armed conflict of children under the age of 18.

""""It is premature to call the summit a success in human rights terms, although we're delighted President Clinton spoke out as pointedly as he did, especially on live television,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The challenge is now to take the issues that are on the table now and use the summit to secure concrete progress on all four. We obviously don't expect all problems to be solved in a nine-day visit, and we realize human rights is only one of many topics on Mr. Clinton's agenda. But the President has demonstrated that U.S.-China relations can be strengthened even as differences are fully and forcefully aired. Now he and his staff should use the remaining days in China to get down to hard negotiations on human rights, so that he returns to Washington with more than vague promises of dialogue and exchange."""" She noted that of the fourteen agreements announced Saturday, only two related to human rights, and neither addressed ongoing abuses. In each of the four areas, Human Rights Watch gave examples of what could be done.  1. Freedom of expression and association The organization gave Mr. Clinton high marks for his assertion that the Tiananmen crackdown was wrong and for arguing that """"stability in the twenty-first century will require high levels of freedom"""" in China. In the spirit of those remarks, Mr. Clinton, before leaving China, should get his hosts to lift the ban on Chinese pro-democracy activists abroad from returning home, arguing that many of these exiles are well-placed to provide the ideas for reform that will be critical to China's future. He should also secure a commitment that there will be no retaliation against Chinese in Xian, Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere who dared to give interviews to Western journalists or in other ways speak out during the president's trip. (Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned about Bao Tong, the former Chinese Communist Party official who called for political reform in recent interviews; Ding Zilin, an advocate on behalf of the 1989 victims, who was reportedly ordered not to leave her home until Clinton departs Beijing; and Xu Wenli, a long-time activist.) And he should ensure that the rule of law programs to which the administration is committed include a focus on the rights guaranteed by the international treaty that China has promised it will sign later this year, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  2. Arbitrary detention President Clinton noted he had raised with President Jiang Zemin the problem of people """"incarcerated now for offenses no longer on the books in China"""" as well as those detained since 1989 for non-violent offenses, and said he asked if these people could be released. Now he should step up efforts to secure those releases. He should also ensure that any public references to agreed on law programs be used not just to praise legal reforms already in place but to press for an end to the problems that remain, including the system of """"re-education through labor,"""" an administrative punishment of up to three years' detention in a labor camp for those who run afoul of authorities. The President could offer assistance to the Chinese government, as he implicitly did in the question-and-answer session on Saturday, to find a legal mechanism for review of the cases of the 2,000 so-called """"counterrevolutionaries"""" -- a small fraction of the total number of political prisoners in China -- who remain in prison even though the offense of """"counterrevolution"""" was removed from China's criminal law last year. 3. Tibet Since the issue of Tibet was discussed at greater length than any other rights issue, the groundwork has been laid to pursue three issues of particular importance: release of Tibetan prisoners who have not used violence; securing verifiable information on the whereabouts and current status of the nine-year-old Panchen Lama, the second highest figure in Tibetan Buddhism; and securing improved access to Tibet for the international press and human rights organizations. (Access by the press to the Panchen Lama would be one way of verifying official Chinese government claims that the boy is leading a normal life.) 4. Freedom of Religion President Clinton raised the issue of freedom of religion in broad terms,in the context of his remarks during the Saturday press conference as well as his own attendance at an """"official"""" church in Beijing. Given subsequent remarks by Chinese officials that religious activists detained in China are not being held for their beliefs, President Clinton needs to find a way during his remaining days to rebut the Chinese government's position that freedom of religion is the same as freedom to believe, whereas in fact it embraces freedom to meet, train leaders, educate followers, and distribute material. He should also find a way of stressing that he is concerned over restrictions on the freedom of all religions in China -- Buddhism, Islam, and Daoism, as well as Christianity.  """"We have been concerned that the Clinton administration has seemed willing to sacrifice targeted pressure on human rights for an ill-defined 'human rights dialogue,' """" said Jones. """"President Clinton should came back from China with some concrete commitments from the Chinese government and a clearly articulated human rights policy that directly addresses each of the issues he raised with President Jiang.""""","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

The organization called, however, for Japan to reconsider its opposition to an independent prosecutor for the ICC.     In speeches this week to more than 150 delegations meeting in Rome, the Japanese delegation announced that, after a """"major review""""of its positions on the proposed court, Japan was revising its position on the most contentious and important issue to be decided at the conference: the question of """"state consent,"""" or whether individual governments will have to give their permission before an investigation can go forward. Japan's new position - similar to that of the growing bloc of """"like-minded""""states from Europe, Latin America, Africa and Asia - is that once a state ratifies the treaty establishing the court, it accepts the court's authority to try cases involving its citizens.     The proposed ICC would have the power to investigate and prosecute future acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.     """"Japan has an important role to play in creating this court, and its new position is bringing the world one step closer to a truly effective ICC,"""" said Richard Dicker, who leads the ICC campaign for Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring organization based in New York. """"With Japan's help, this court could end impunity for the most heinous crimes.""""     Japan now believes that any state which has signed the treaty ought to able refer instances of these crimes to the court for prosecution. Tokyo had earlier insisted that only states with a direct """"interest"""" in the prosecution should be allowed to refer matters to the court.     Japan continued, however, to express its opposition to an independent prosecutor, who could begin investigations on her own initiative. A growing majority of states, including Canada, Australia and virtually all European countries, as well as key democracies such as South Korea, South Africa, Senegal, Argentina and Chile, support an independent prosecutor. The idea is opposed by a minority including Libya, Cuba, Iraq, the United States, Russia and China.     Human Rights Watch believes an independent prosecutor will reduce the likelihood of politically-motivated cases coming before the court. """"A lot of crimes will go unpunished if the prosecutor has to wait for what the Security Council refers to her, or for complaints from member states."""" said Dicker. """"If that's the case, this court won't be able to dispense real justice. Experience shows that states are very reluctant to register complaints against other states."""" Dicker expressed the hope that Japan's position """"would evolve as the conference develops.""""     The ICC conference will run until July 17 and is expected to produce a statute establishing the ICC.","Asia, Japan","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

To date, at least ten activists remain unaccounted for, and investigations seem to be on hold. """"Evidence of military involvement in the disappearances is by now overwhelming,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The lack of progress to date is increasingly looking like a cover-up _ if the new Habibie government wants to be seen as different from its predecessor and committed to the protection of human rights, it is going to have to pursue this issue far more aggressively than it has done thus far."""" On May 1, General Wiranto, commander of the armed forces and Defense Minister, set up a Fact-Finding Team to look into the disappearances, after strong domestic and international pressure to address the issue. As of June, six of the resurfaced activists had given testimony to the military police, but they say thus far, there has been no follow-up.  """"Finding and prosecuting the people who abducted and tortured these activists is critical to redefining the army's role in post-Soeharto Indonesia,"""" said Jones. """"If nothing happens, it will confirm the fears of those who say that the fundamental power structure in Indonesia is unchanged. If those responsible are held accountable and the truth of who ordered these disappearances comes out, then there is real hope for human rights in Indonesia.""""  The evidence of military involvement is strong, especially since in many of the cases, the kidnappers either picked their victims up from district military commands or took them from a kind of safehouse where they were held to police or military commands in Jakarta. The failure of the military fact-finding team to come up with any facts after almost two months suggests a deliberate decision to keep the truth hidden.  The military's involvement is indicated by the following: Andi Arief, the twenty-eight-year-old head of Indonesia Student Solidarity for Democracy (SMID), was abducted from his sister's house in Bandar Lampung by two men in plainclothes on March 28 at 10:30 a.m. The men, who were not in uniform, showed no identification and produced no warrant, searched the shop, found Andi Arief, and took him away. Andi's family reported the abduction to the provincial police command, the city police command, and the regional military command; all said they had no role in the arrest. On March 31, the information officer of the Indonesian armed forces denied that the armed forces _ which in Indonesia include the police _ were detaining any of the missing. On April 3, he denied that the security forces were behind the disappearances. On April 16, the Jakarta military commander said he had ordered all his troops to help find the missing. On April 21, Andi Arief's parents received a call from national police headquarters in Jakarta informing them that their son was being held there. Two days later, they received a formal detention order by post, saying that Andi Arief was being held both as a suspect in a subversion case and as a witness in a subversion case against two students charged with using explosives in connection with a homemade bomb that went off prematurely in an apartment in the Tanah Tinggi area of Jakarta on January 18, 1998. The order was backdated to March 29. On April 22, the commander of the Indonesian police, Maj.Gen. (Pol) Dibyo Widodo, publicly denied any knowledge of Andi Arief's whereabouts, when in fact, Andi Arief had been detained for five days in the same complex where Widodo works. On April 26, national police headquarters issued a statement that Andi Arief had been in police custody since March.  Two of those still missing, Yani Afri and Sonny, were picked up in April 1997 from the North Jakarta district military command where they had been taken after their arrest. They were taken directly from the district command to the safehouse where most of the activists have been held until their removal on March 12, 1998; the district commander must therefore have information on those responsible for the safehouse.  Three of the resurfaced activists, Nezar Patria, Aan Rusdianto, and Mugianto, all SMID activists, were abducted by four masked men from their lodgings in Klender, East Jakarta, and taken first to the East Jakarta district military command and from there to the safehouse on March 13 and 14. They were then taken by their captors to the metropolitan Jakarta police command, where they were accused of belonging to a banned organization. They were blindfolded at the time they were turned over to the police. Again, both the police and the district military commander must have knowledge about the operation.  Reports in the international press, based in part on interviews with the military and with the resurfaced activists, have pointed to a unit of Kopassus, the army special forces, as being responsible.  According to the Jakarta-based organization Kontras (Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence), those still """"disappeared"""" are as follows:  1-2. Yani Afri, known as """"Rian,"""" 27, a driver originally from the Tanjung Priok area of Jakarta, who worked with the faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) supporting Megawati Soekarnoputri, and Sonny, another PDI supporter. Both were arrested on April 26, 1997 as the parliamentary election campaign was heating up and initially taken to the North Jakarta district military command (KODIM) where they were held overnight. Yani Avri's mother went to the KODIM twice after learning her son had been taken there, but was told the second time that he had already been removed to another location. It turned out that both men had been taken to the same detention center in Jakarta where several of the activists who have since resurfaced were held. One of those activists, Pius Lustrilanang, who talked to Sonny and Rian while they were held there, reports that they were taken out from their cells on March 12, 1998. They have not been seen nor heard from since.  3-5. Dedy Hamdun, a supporter of the United Development Party (PPP), was abducted during the May 1997 election campaign and held for three and a half months in the same place as Pius and the other activists. (He was already gone by the time Pius Lustrilanang arrived, but other detainees reported that he had been there.) According to them, Dedy was taken away from the detention center together with two men named Noval Alkatiri and Ismail. Both are still missing.  6. Herman Hendrawan, a political science student from Airlangga University in Surabaya, was originally reported by the head of the East Java police on April 17 to have returned home, but to date, he remains missing. He disappeared with two other students, both of whom have since resurfaced, on March 12, 1998, after attending a press conference in the offices of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute in Jakarta.  7. Suyat, a university student from Solo who was active in the leftwing organization called Indonesian Student Solidarity for Democracy (SMID), has been missing since February 12, 1998. According to Suyat's brother, five men who were not in uniform and showed no identification but said in response to a question that they were """"officers"""" (petugas) came to the family's house in Gemolong, Sragen, Central Java at about 2:00 a.m. on February 12, looking for Suyat. The family said he was not at home, but the men entered anyway and began searching the house. According to an April 16 account in the Surabaya newspaper Jawa Pos, when the men could not find Suyat, they took away his brother, Suyatno. After being interrogated in an unknown place, Suyatno told human rights workers that he was blindfolded and tied up and then brought to the house of one of Suyat's friends in Karanganyar, outside Solo, then to the house of another friend in Kalijambe, Sragen, where Suyat was staying. The five men took Suyat away and dropped off Suyatno on the outskirts of Sumber village. No one has seen or heard from Suyat since.  8. Petrus Bima Anugerah, known as Bimo, aged twenty-five, is a student at the Driyakara School of Philosophy in Jakarta and a member of the militant political organization, the People's Democratic Party (PRD). He has not been seen or heard from since March 31. His father officially reported him missing to the national police command on April 12.  9. Mohamed Yusuf, twenty-eight, a schoolteacher and student in the pharmacy department of University of Indonesia, has been missing since May 1997 when he was campaigning for the United Development Party (PPP).  10. Ucok Munandar Siahaan, twenty-two, a student activist from Perbanas, a banking association, disappeared after the riots in Jakarta on May 13-14, 1998. His mother reported that she knew he had not been injured in the riots because he called her afterwards, but he never returned home. While the case does not fall within the same pattern as the others, the failure to resolve the others makes the case of any missing student activist all the more worrisome.","Asia, Indonesia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/06/19/cambodia-fair-elections-not-possible","Cambodia- Fair Elections Not Possible","Cambodia: Fair Elections Not Possible","","06/19/1998","In a new report issued today, Human Rights Watch concludes that the present political environment in Cambodia, in which opposition parties are not able to operate freely and safely, is in no way conducive to the holding of free, fair, and credible elections scheduled for July 26, 1998.   The report was issued on the eve of a June 20 meeting in Bangkok, Thailand of the grouping of countries known as the Friends of Cambodia.  """"The primary obstacle is neither logistical nor technical, but the rather the determination of the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) to control the electoral process and restrict basic freedoms,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The most important obstacle to fair elections remains the utter lack of accountability of Cambodian authorities and the failure to investigate or prosecute perpetrators of abuse. With only six weeks left before the scheduled polling, there is no chance that a deeply flawed and rushed electoral process will help Cambodia either establish democracy or bring an end to disruptive military activities."""" Human Rights Watch recommends postponement of elections until the conditions conducive to a free and fair poll are in place. However, recognizing that the international and domestic momentum to hold elections in July is strong and indeed, may be impossible to halt, Human Rights Watch recommends concrete steps that donor nations and the Cambodian government can take to minimize yet further human rights abuses and even greater intimidation of Cambodian citizens in exercising their right to elect a government. During a research mission to Cambodia from February to April 1998, Human Rights Watch found the following: Political violence in Phnom Penh and the countryside has continued since the coup of July 1997. The violence -- in conjunction with the government's failure to investigate and prosecute any perpetrators -- has left its mark. Opposition members know that to be politically active is to court danger or even death. The violence has caused a widespread climate of fear, stifled dissent, and intimidated voters. Local-level opposition political activists have been effectively blocked by the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen from rebuilding their party structures and taking their message to the countryside. National and local-level institutions mandated by an election law passed in October 1997 to organize and oversee the elections are dominated by the CPP. The CPP has launched an aggressive nationwide campaign to pressure voters into signing up with the party. In addition to monitoring opposition party members, it is following the activities of groups it considers politically suspect, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs), students and academics, trade union members, as well as political refugees who have returned to Cambodia from Thai refugee camps. Opposition political parties' lack of equal access to the broadcast media has not been rectified by media regulations issued for the election campaign period which starts June 25. International and local observer groups have yet to make much of a presence in monitoring the electoral process. As of mid-June -- halfway through the critical period of voter registration --only nineteen international observers were on the ground. Only 300 international monitors have been committed to observe the process, with most of them arriving in the last weeks of the campaign. They will be expected to cover more than 11,000 polling stations and 1,600 counting centers. A functioning Constitutional Council, the country's highest appeals body, which is mandated to adjudicate electoral disputes and ultimately to rule on the legitimacy of the election itself, has yet to meet more than once. Several members of the council have boycotted the meetings, charging that the body, which is dominated by CPP members, was set up in an illegal and unconstitutional manner. The return of Prince Norodom Ranariddh to Cambodia on March 30, 1998, after nine months in self-exile, did not significantly affect the prospects either for a free and fair election or for a lasting cease-fire between the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) and resistance forces loyal to Ranariddh, who was ousted as First Prime Minister by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in a July 1997 coup. As of mid-June, truce talks between the two forces were stalled.  Human Rights Watch cautions, however, that postponement alone will achieve little unless the international community speaks with one voice in setting forth the conditions that must be met to guarantee a fair election and backs that up with significant economic and diplomatic pressure. The group believes that fair elections and an end to impunity for human rights offenders are linked: opposition parties will only be free to organize and campaign when it is clear that acts of political violence will be punished. Two steps that should be taken to help ensure an end to impunity would be the establishment of a genuinely independent commission of inquiry into the killings that occurred during and after the July 1997 coup and prosecution of offenders. It would also be critical to repeal Article 51 of the Civil Servants Act, which provides that civil servants cannot be arrested or prosecuted for any crime unless their governmental department agrees in advance. If the momentum toward meeting the July date cannot be halted, we believe the Friends of Cambodia -- many of whom were instrumental in the peace process that led to Cambodia's 1993 U.N.-organized elections -- have a particular responsibility to try and ensure the safety of the voters and reduce the likelihood that the voting will be manipulated, without at the same time lending legitimacy to the process by providing """"technical assistance"""" to the Cambodian government.  The most important step the Friends of Cambodia could take at this stage is to ensure that as many qualified observers and monitors arrive in the country as soon as possible, to act as a deterrent to political violence and intimidation of voters and candidates in the weeks that remain, to monitor the actual polling and vote-counting and protect the secrecy of the ballot, and to monitor the transition of power to the victors in the weeks following the election. If donor resources are to go anywhere, it should be to this monitoring effort. In addition, if elections go forward, the donors should also insist on a minimum set of conditions that are entirely within the Cambodian government's power to meet, even at this late date. The government should be asked to: Take immediate and concrete steps to assure the electorate that how they or their village vote will not be detected or traced back to them or used against them. The best way to do this would be by moving the location of the ballot count from commune to provincial level and providing extra security and additional international monitors to accompany the ballot boxes during transport. Revise media regulations established for the electoral campaign period to enable immediate and full access of all parties to government-owned or -controlled media. Political parties should be given the right of ownership of private media and, in accordance with the Cambodian constitution, not be censored in their news coverage or political programming. Make public statements to underscore the secrecy of the ballot, explicitly stating that voters should vote their consciences and are in no way beholden to any pre-poll pledges that they may have made to vote for any party. Such statements are likely to ring hollow, however, unless a massive international monitoring presence is in place. Impose sanctions from the election law on parties that coerce or pressure villagers to join or pledge to vote for them, although how free villagers will feel to raise complaints about coercion in the current climate is a real question. Postpone the launching of the Constitutional Council until after the elections. Given that it is too late for the Constitutional Council to resolve election disputes that have already taken place, or to settle questions about the legitimacy of the council itself, a Constitutional Council should not be rushed into place at this late date nor attempt to play a role in verifying the final election results. Meeting the above conditions will not necessarily guarantee a fair election, but it might reduce the possibility of abuse and intimidation. It will then be the responsibility of the Friends of Cambodia to begin work immediately on a program that will at least try to ensure the Cambodia moves in a direction that will make future elections more fair. To do this, the Friends should: Continue to exert pressure on the Cambodian government to prosecute clear cases of extrajudicial executions that took place during and since the 1997 coup. As requested by Human Rights Watch previously, the United States should publicly and promptly release information obtained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concerning the March 30, 1997 grenade attack on the peaceful gathering organized by opposition politician Sam Rainsy in Phnom Penh. Keep Cambodia's membership in ASEAN on hold and continue to hold vacant Cambodia's seat at the U.N. until genuinely free and fair elections have taken place. Refrain from resuming full-scale government aid -- both bilateral and multilateral, and via international financial institutions -- until after elections, and then only if the election is judged by international monitors to be fair and any transfer of power is both peaceful and lawful. In the absence of free and fair elections this July, any humanitarian aid given directly to government agencies should be conditioned on the degree to which the government takes steps to prosecute perpetrators of political violence and ends the climate of impunity. We are not advocating any restrictions on aid channeled through NGOs or through international humanitarian or development agencies.","Asia, Cambodia",""

During his upcoming state visit, the President is scheduled to appear in a welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen Square and to deliver a major speech at Beijing University. Emphasizing that the President's presence at such locations will have """"immense symbolic importance"""" for democracy advocates throughout China, the letter urges the President to seize the opportunity by publicly stressing the inseparable link between intellectual and political freedom, and by drawing attention to cases of Chinese academics currently in jail for expressing their views.   The letter was signed on behalf of the committee by Fang Lizhi, internationally prominent Chinese astrophysicist and dissident who now teaches in exile at the University of Arizona and who, in 1989, was first on the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's most wanted list, and by Jonathan Fanton, President of the New School for Social Research.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/06/18/hrw-academic-freedom-committees-letter-president-clinton","HRW Academic Freedom Committees Letter to President Clinton","HRW Academic Freedom Committee's Letter to President Clinton","","06/18/1998","President Clinton The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington, D.C. Dear President Clinton:   We understand that during your upcoming state visit to China you will be delivering a speech at Beijing University and will make an appearance at Tiananmen Square as part of the Chinese government's welcoming ceremony. On behalf of the Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee, a group of scholars and academic leaders organized in 1991 to protest restrictions on academic freedom and abuse of the basic rights of educators and students worldwide, we urge that you use every opportunity afforded by your visit, in particular your speech at Beijing University, to speak out forcefully in support of academic freedom and the basic rights of the scholarly community in China.   Your public endorsement of academic freedom will have immense symbolic importance for Chinese scholars and students. As you know, academics and students at Beijing University and elsewhere have long played a leading role in the push for democracy and freedom in China, from the May Fourth movement of 1919 to the Tiananmen Square democracy movement of 1989. In both 1919 and 1989, many of China's leading scholars and students called for """"Democracy and Science,"""" realizing that the freedom to pursue research and scholarship unfettered by censorship and persecution cannot be separated from basic political freedoms. The following comments, published in 1995, still hold: """"A dictatorship is never interested in academic freedom. This is because such freedom represents the most effective constraint on power; it is an uncontrollable source of potential opposition . . . . Why is it that people who do research and are involved in education have always conflicted with [authoritarian rule]? The answer is quite simple: the basic spirit and methods of science require free research, which directly conflicts with an ideology of tyranny."""" (Fang Lizhi, """"China: Academic Freedom and Ideological Barriers."""")   Although Chinese citizens and scholars enjoy more freedom of expression and greater liberty to comment on political subjects than they did in the years immediately following the suppression of the pro-democracy movement at Tiananmen Square and throughout China in 1989, the authorities continue to imprison dissidents and to impose far-reaching ideological controls on the academic community. Your visit to Beijing University presents you with the opportunity to deliver a message to the tens of thousands of Chinese scientists, scholars, and students who cherish intellectual freedom and know firsthand the costs of political intolerance and repression for the development of Chinese science and society. If you are silent, you will send a message of tacit endorsement for the Chinese authorities' repressive policies. If you publicly emphasize the close connection between scholarly autonomy and protection of citizens' basic right to free expression, and publicly draw attention to the cases of Chinese academics still in prison for expressing their views, you will send a strong message of support to those in China who have been most courageous in standing for freedom.   A university earns respect and achieves intellectual excellence when academics are not forced to support a government, an economic agenda, or a political ideology, but rather are free to use their talents to advance human knowledge and understanding. In China, that freedom is fettered by damaging ideological and institutional constraints, the imprisonment of critical academics, and foreign exile and denial of re-entry to those who freely speak their minds.   Ideological and Institutional Controls   Ideological surveillance remains a significant barrier to intellectual freedom in China. This is not simply the legacy of decades past. In 1997, the government introduced a host of new regulations and restrictions expressly aimed at strengthening ideological training and Communist Party control over universities in China.  In January 1997, the government announced new censorship regulations, effective February 1, banning all publications that questioned the legitimacy of communist rule or were not in line with """"socialist morality.""""  In April 1997, the government announced arbitrary new restrictions on public opinion research, household surveys, and studies of demographics, important tools for understanding citizens' attitudes toward economic reform and other social and political issues.  A memo from the Propaganda Ministry, the Office of the Secretary of the Politburo, and the Office of the State Council, also made public in April 1997, announced that all social science projects involving foreign funding henceforth would require approval from the Public Security Bureau and National Security and Foreign ministries. The new restrictions coincided with a campaign at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences against """"theories and opinions that are against Marxism, the leadership of the Party and the people's democratic dictatorship  In June 1997, the well-publicized Sixth National Conference on Party Building in Institutions of Higher Education called on all members of the academic community to firmly pursue the party's line, principles, and policies, echoing a government decree issued in October 1996 ordering university administrators to consult campus-based Communist Party representatives on all major decisions.  Also in June, academics in Beijing were ordered to inform the police in advance if they planned to hold conferences attended by more than twenty participants, regardless of location. Scholars wishing to engage in exchange programs or joint activities with foreign and Taiwanese institutions were required to secure prior permission from the Ministry of State Security, the Ministry of Public Security, and the State Education Commission, as well as from local, campus-based Communist Party committees.  New controls on the Internet also were introduced in 1997, requiring all Internet service providers to apply for licenses from the authorities and provide data on the scope and nature of their activities. Meanwhile, dozens of World Wide Web sites that had been proscribed and electronically blocked by the government in 1996, including those of overseas-based dissident groups and human rights organizations, remain inaccessible to the country's estimated several hundred thousand Internet users.  Finally, the Chinese government continues to deny visas and research access to overseas scholars, including many prominent American sinologists, whose works the government finds ideologically or politically objectionable.   Arrest and Imprisonment of Critical Academics   Although the China National People's Congress in 1997 removed the counterrevolutionary acts provision from the criminal code and replaced it with """"endangering state security,"""" and although the Chinese government has released a number of dissidents in the past year, numerous proponents of democratic reform remain behind bars. Although we are unable to present a complete list of cases because the government strictly limits access to information on political prisoners, individual cases that you should raise with Chinese authorities include:  Chen Lantao, a thirty-seven year-old marine biologist, was sentenced in 1989 to eighteen years in jail, with five years subsequent deprivation of political rights. Although he was charged with """"counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement"""" (since dropped from the criminal code) and """"disturbing the social order and traffic,"""" Chen apparently was arrested for a speech delivered just days after the June fourth incident in which he excoriated the government for the crackdown and called for political reform.  Ngawang Choephel, a thirty-five-year-old U.S.-based Tibetan ethnomusicologist, was sentenced in December 1996 to eighteen years in prison by a Lhasa court for alleged """"espionage"""" in connection with research he had been carrying out in Tibet.  Li Hai, a former philosophy student from Beijing University who had been detained incommunicado since May 1995, was sentenced in late 1996 to nine years in prison on state secrets-related charges for compiling a list of names and other details of Beijing residents still in prison in connection with the 1989 pro-democracy movement.  In January 1997, five prominent dissidents from Guiyang, detained since mid-1995 for advocating democratic reform, were tried and sentenced for alleged """"subversive activities."""" Chen Xi, leader of the group and a lecturer at Guizhou Jinzhu University, received a ten-year prison term. The other men received sentences ranging from two to five years.  Two members of the Southern Mongolian Democratic Alliance, Hada and Tegexi, were sentenced to fifteen and ten years in prison respectively on charges of separatism and espionage on December 6, 1996, had their appeals rejected in late January 1997. Both are being held in a crowded cell in Inner Mongolia No.1 Prison. The two were part of a group of ten intellectuals arrested in late 1995 for their association with the Alliance, a social organization to promote Mongolian culture and """"the concept of a high degree of autonomy for China's minorities as guaranteed by the constitution."""" In two peaceful protests following the arrests, some 200 people including university students and teachers demonstrated their support for those arrested. Police broke up the demonstrations and held more than several dozen for questioning. Hada and his wife managed the Mongolian Academic Bookshop in Hohhot. The bookstore was closed after Hada's arrest and its contents confiscated. His wife has twice petitioned two government agencies to permit her to reopen it. Neither agency has replied.  Wang Youcai, No. 15 on the government's most wanted students list after the 1989 pro-democracy movement and a former Beijing University student, was held for eight days beginning on April 27, 1998, when he tried to participate in the celebration of Beijing University's one-hundredth anniversary. To keep him from contact with current students, Wang was returned to Hangzhou on April 28 and held until May 5.   Forced Exile   The Chinese authorities also continue to violate the basic civil and political rights of Chinese intellectuals who dare to express their views by sending them into forced exile and by denying them permission to visit academic colleagues, family, and friends in China. As you know, dissident leaders Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan were among those released into forced exile in the past year. They are just two of dozens of exiles who are prohibited from returning to China. Until all Chinese are free to express their views in China, the release of dissidents cannot be called an unqualified victory for democracy or human rights.   Many other Chinese now residing overseas face harassment upon return to China. Most recently, Li Xiaorong, a researcher at the University of Maryland who now holds an American passport, flew to China in early April 1998 to visit her parents. She had just arrived at her parents' house in Sichuan province when the police came and took her away, driving her to the airport that night. She believes that she was forced out of the country as a result of her active support of human rights in China.   By speaking frankly on the above subjects during your speech at Beijing University and at every other opportunity afforded by your visit to China, you can send a strong signal of support to the Chinese academic community and to advocates of freedom and democracy both in China and abroad.   Thank you for your consideration of this important matter. Sincerely yours,   /s/ Fang Lizhi Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom Committee Professor of Physics,  University of Arizona /s/ Jonathan F.

Human Rights Watch, which visited the camps last week, found that some 32,000 Sierra Leonean refugees in one camp in Lofa county, Liberia are receiving inadequate assistance and face serious security threats due to their proximity to the border of Sierra Leone where fighting continues. The UNHCR, in conjunction with the Liberian government and other humanitarian organizations, must urgently develop and implement a clear plan to assist and protect refugees in Lofa county.  """"The refugees are in need of immediate food, medicine and other aid, assistance with their relocation to new, safer camps farther away from the border, and protection from combatants,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"Yet, the international community and humanitarian agencies have been slow to provide such assistance, apparently due to the risk of international aid being diverted to support active combatants in Sierra Leone.""""  Human Rights Watch emphasized that the lack of a concerted international plan to provide aid and address protection issues head on is likely to worsen the humanitarian disaster and increase the possibility of the violence spreading into Liberia. The most vulnerable refugees are paying the price for the reluctance of the international community to provide assistance: as local food sources dwindle, malnutrition and disease, especially among infants and children, are rising. As time passes, these refugees will become physically weaker and less able to relocate themselves. Moreover, as the humanitarian situation deteriorates, security conditions will likely degrade. The lack of adequate food and medical care for the refugees has increased tensions in the camp and could lead to violence.  Former combatants, some of whom may have been responsible for gross atrocities against the civilian population in Sierra Leone, including killings, amputations, rape, sexual violence, and abductions, remain mixed with the general refugee population. Unless this problem is addressed, and combatants are separated from the general refugee population in both camps in the area, violence will likely escalate. In addition, many disarmed ex-combatants in the camps have expressed their desire to be re-integrated into society, but given the lack of other options or assistance, the combatants are likely to re-arm themselves, divert aid in the camps, and resort to fighting or banditry in Liberia or Sierra Leone.  An effective relief plan should include the provision of emergency aid to refugees as well as a rapid and humane approach to relocation to safer camps farther away from the border. The most vulnerable refugees should be assisted to the extent possible with their relocation, including the provision of transport for the malnourished, sick, and elderly, as well as sufficient health posts, emergency food and shelter, and security on the road between the camps. Efforts to separate former combatants from the general refugee population must be put into place. The relocation of the refugee population provides an opportunity to establish a screening procedure to separate ex-combatants from refugees. Where appropriate, those responsible for committing war crimes should be prosecuted and held accountable for their crimes.","Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Refugees and Migrants"

Mr. Duran's imprisonment provides further evidence of the arbitrary nature of laws in Turkey that restrict free expression and constitutes a clear violation of Turkey's international human rights obligations.  On December 19, 1994 the Istanbul State Security Court No. 5 found Mr. Duran, who has worked as a journalist for the BBC and Agence France Press, guilty of violating Article 7 of the 1991 Anti-Terror Law, which prohibits conducting """"propaganda for outlawed organizations."""" The conviction was based on an article in which Mr. Duran called Abdullah Öcalan a """"Kurdish Garibaldi."""" The article appeared in the now closed pro-Kurdish daily Özgür Gündem. Ironically, Mr. Duran had interviewed the PKK leader in 1991 and had written similar stories in March 1991 for the Istanbul-daily Cumhuriyet. In those articles, which were published without prosecution, he referred to M.calan as a """"Kurdish Zapatista.""""  On October 23, 1997, the High Court of Appeal (Yarg tay) confirmed the ten-month sentence and fine of TL333,333,333 (around $1,300) handed down by the lower court. Laws that restrict peaceful free expression are usually applied by prosecutors according to the political climate in Turkey. In 1991, a period of liberalization in Turkey, Mr. Duran could call the PKK leader a """"Zapatista"""" without incident. Three years later, during a period of escalating violence, Mr. Duran was prosecuted for a similar article about Mr. Ocalan. The very arbitrariness of the enforcement of such laws serves to keep journalists uncertain about the legal limits they face in their work and may cause them to self-censor their writing. """"Ragip Duran should have been free to publish both articles without facing legal sanctions. These articles fall squarely within the limits of protected speech that is guaranteed by international human rights law,"""" commented Holly Cartner, the executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division.  The minority coalition government of Prime Minister Y lmaz has presented a bill before parliament that would amend several articles of the Turkish Penal Code restricting free expression as well as Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law prohibiting separatist propaganda. The bill is part of a larger draft amending the Penal Code. """"We welcome the effort of the Y lmaz government to change laws that restrict peaceful free expression and hope the bill passes, even though it would not aid those like Mr. Duran who are sentenced under Article 7 of the Anti-Terror Law. However, the government must make further efforts to abolish laws that penalize peaceful free expression to allow the release of all those presently imprisoned under such charges. All of Turkey's citizens, especially its lawmakers, need to ask themselves what purpose is served and how Turkey is strengthened by prosecuting writers, intellectuals and journalists such as Ragip Duran, E ber Ya murdereli, Ya ar Kemal, and Ahmet Altan,"""" Ms. Cartner added.  Those sentenced under the Anti-Terror Law must serve 3/4 of their sentence. Mr. Duran is confined in the prison in the Saray district of Tekirda province in western Turkey. In 1997, Mr. Duran was a recipient of a Hellman/Hammett award, which is given to journalists and writers who face state repression. The award, granted by Human Rights Watch, is made possible through the estate of the writers Lillian Hellman and Dashell Hammett.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Dozens, mainly civilians, have died in air raids launched since the escalation of the undeclared war between the two countries. Human Rights Watch welcomed the agreement reached between the two countries on June 14 to halt air strikes, and urged them to stop all military attacks on civilians. It also condemned the rounding up and expulsion of long-term Eritrean residents from Ethiopia and of Ethiopian nationals from Eritrea, and called on the two countries to immediately halt the harassment and targeting of civilians.   Background   Hundreds have died in the fratricidal conflict between the two former allies and thousands of civilians were displaced as a minor border dispute escalated into an undeclared war in the first week of June. Many of the victims are civilians. Four persons were reportedly killed and twenty-six were wounded when Ethiopia raided Asmara's airport on June 5. On the same day, forty-seven people, including many school children, were killed when Eritrean planes bombed the Ethiopian town of Mekele. On Thursday, June 11, four people were killed and dozens more were wounded in an Eritrean air raid on the northern Ethiopian town of Adigrat. Thousands of the inhabitants fled to surrounding villages fearing further attacks.   Harassment of Ethiopians in Eritrea and of Eritrean residents in Ethiopia is on the increase. Eritrean authorities reportedly rounded up dozens from among the estimated 100,000 Ethiopians living in the country. Fearing for their safety, hundreds more Ethiopians rushed to their embassy in Asmara to seek travel documents to leave the country. Although Eritrea denied Ethiopia's claim that it had expelled 3,000 Ethiopians, it was independently reported that Eritrean soldiers at border posts with Ethiopia turned back busloads of fleeing Ethiopians, invoking security concerns.   On the other side of the border, it is known that some 130,000 Eritreans residents had voted during the 1993 referendum on the independence of Eritrea, but unofficial estimates put the number of Eritrean residents at 550,000. In an official """"policy"""" statement issued on June 11, the Ethiopian government ordered members of Eritrean political and community organizations to leave the country, accusing them of supporting the Eritrean war effort. According to the same policy, Eritreans in management positions in """"sensitive"""" sectors of the economy would be compelled to take a one-month leave of absence. While the statement suggested an option of voluntary departure for the targeted categories of Eritrean residents, Ethiopian authorities proceeded this week to selectively round up Eritreans accused of espionage and supporting the ruling front in Eritrea. As many as eight hundred of these were reportedly expelled to the border. Those detained and expelled include many elderly, retired citizens, mainly businessmen, who have lived most of their lives and raised their children in Ethiopia. Many of the younger deportees could reportedly face trouble in Eritrea for having dodged the national service there or engaged in the exiled opposition. Ethiopia also detained twenty local workers after the closure of Eritrean consulates in the country.   Recommendations   Human Rights Watch calls on the governments of Eritrea and Ethiopia to:  issue clear and binding instructions to their armed forces to respect the basic principles of humanitarian law regarding the protection of noncombatants; take steps to investigate incidents where civilians were either deliberately or indiscriminately targeted by their armed forces, and prosecute troops responsible for these violations of the laws of war;  treat all prisoners of war, and all those detained in relation to the conflict, humanely, and allow access to them by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent and other international observers;  cease the arbitrary arrest and expulsion of residents from each country; take all necessary measures to ensure the protection of civilians exposed to risks due to the current conflict.   Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to: press the two governments to strictly abide by the basic principles of humanitarian law by halting all attacks on civilians;  press the two governments to immediately investigate incidents where civilians were either deliberately or indiscriminately targeted by their armed forces, and to bring the military responsible for these attacks to justice;  urge the two governments to halt the arbitrary detentions and expulsions of nationals from the other country;  send observers to monitor the detention conditions of civilians held in relation to the conflict and press for them to be immediately released or charged with recognizable crimes before a regular court of law.","Africa, Eritrea, Ethiopia",""

""""A lot of crimes will go unpunished if the prosecutor is limited to what the Security Council refers to her, and to complaints from member states."""" said Dicker. """"If that's the case, this court won't be able to dispense real justice.

The report, issued in Spanish, describes a series of grave human rights abuses in the country's dangerous, overcrowded and physically deteriorating penal facilities.  At the same time, the U.S.-based human rights group released in English and Spanish a letter to President Rafael Caldera calling for independent investigation of extrajudicial executions by Venezuelan police forces in recent years.  An independent commission should also make recommendations to end such brutal practices by the police, the group said. The letter detailed eight cases that illustrate the range of extrajudicial executions carried out by police between 1993 and 1997, almost all of them ending in impunity for the perpetrators. Human Rights Watch noted encouraging promises from the authorities on prison reform in the last few years, but little concrete improvement in the prisons. """"In fact, last year was one of the most violent years on record, with hundreds of inmates killed and well over a thousand injured,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"Even pretrial detainees _ presumed innocent of any crime _ have faced these arbitrary and unadjudicated death sentences. Because of such abuses, the prison issue remains a blight on President Caldera's record in office.""""  According to the 114-page report _ an updated translation of Human Rights Watch's 1997 report, Punishment Before Trial _ a steady traffic in arms facilitates the violence, with weapons of all types flowing into the prisons. In January 1998 alone, prison searches uncovered 2,258 knives, nine pistols, twelve revolvers, 463 artisanal firearms, a rifle, and _ most alarmingly _ four grenades. During that same month, thirty-six inmates were killed.  In June 1997, Minister of Justice Hilarión Cardozo reportedly declared his goal of transforming the prison system, so that in a year he would be able to invite the international community to Venezuela to witness the dramatic changes. Although the necessary reforms have evidently not been implemented as promised, Human Rights Watch believes that the time remaining in the government's term is sufficient to institute significant improvements.  As the report's title suggests, the majority of Venezuelan prisoners are unsentenced _ many of them wait years in prison as their cases winds their way through the inefficient and overwhelmed criminal justice system. One encouraging development discussed in the report is, however, the reform of the code of criminal procedure. The new Código Orgánico Procesal Penal, approved on January 20, 1998, was designed in part to speed up the pace of criminal proceedings and facilitate pretrial release. Another hopeful reform was the establishment of the Office of Supervision and Control of the Penitentiary System (Oficina de Fiscalización y Control del Sistema Penitenciario) in August 1997, which is charged with monitoring human rights abuses in the prisons.  On the negative side of the balance sheet is the lack of progress in the judicial investigations of numerous prison massacres, which remain stalled in the early stages of prosecution. Moreover, despite the opening of new prisons, the problem of severe prison overcrowding remains at the root of many of the penal system's abuses. The report includes detailed recommendations for reform of the country's prisons.  Human Rights Watch's letter to the president about police killings also welcomes the new Código Orgánico Procesal, which should remove some of the obstacles currently in place to the effective investigation, prosecution, and punishment of those who violate human rights.  Nonetheless, the new procedural code will not apply to cases in which investigations were opened before its enactment, which will continue to be prosecuted under the old rules. Because Human Rights Watch and Venezuelan human rights monitors have found a pattern of impunity in these cases, the international organization called for establishment of an independent commission, as recommended in such situations by the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-Legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions.  In addition to naming members to the commission known for their competence and impartiality, Vivanco urged the government to give the commission its full cooperation and to implement faithfully its recommendations as """"a sign of political will to end impunity for human rights violations.""""  Among the eight cases presented by Human Rights Watch was that of José Gregorio Rondón, shot dead in his home in Caracas on July 4, 1997, by members of the Technical Judicial Police, who apparently mistook him for a criminal known as """"El Chino."""" Police tried to cover up their mistake by planting drugs and weapons in Rondón's bedroom, claiming he had violently resisted arrest, and threatening his sister if she did not sign statements incriminating her brother.  Also detailed was the case of eight-year-old Yesser Smith Guzmán Luzón, shot dead by Metropolitan Police on May 24, 1997, as he flew a kite in front of his home in Caracas. Even though the police's initial story that the child died in a shoot-out was dismissed by the Metropolitan Police director, the prosecution remains stalled since the three officers suspected have ignored repeated summons to testify.  """"Unfortunately, these tragic stories are all too frequent in Caracas's slums,"""" Vivanco noted. """"It is imperative that these cases be prosecuted and that reforms be launched so law enforcement can become both effective and respectful of rights.""""","Americas, Venezuela",""

According to reports of survivors, who were recently interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Krnojelac, a teacher of mathematics by profession, was the manager of KP Dom from April 1992 until September 1993. One former prisoner called Krnojelac the """"top director"""" in KP Dom during this period, alleging that Krnojelac had substantial decision-making power.   Reports from survivors of KP Dom (Kazneno-Popravni Dom - Criminal Rehabilitation House) are laden with gruesome tales of starvation, torture, intimidation and threats, beatings, and disappearances . One survivor reported to Human Rights Watch:   I was taken to KP Dom on April 17. There were 730 people in KP Dom during the time I was there. Every night at 8:00 they would come to the rooms to take people for interrogations. Prisoners would have to go to interrogations many times, but I only had to go once. [G]uards and police officers [came] to people's rooms every night at 8:00 and called people's names from a list...They would take some people to the former meeting room and beat them, and around 12 midnight we heard shooting and these people usually never returned. [...] Of the eighteen men in my room, only eight were left at the end. On average more that half of each room was killed or disappeared.   Another Bosniak survivor who was imprisoned in KP Dom for almost a year described the situation in KP Dom:   KP Dom opened [as a detention center] on April 18. Men from the ages of seventeen to eighty-five were held there. When I was brought there, there were already a hundred to 150 there. They were mostly from Donje Polje, the area around KP Dom....During April and May they brought around 600 men to KP Dom. Around 400 of them were taken away and disappeared. I think they were all killed. This happened between April and December 1992. They were taken away in small groups, mostly at night, and sometimes during the day by the guards, with the excuse of taking them to be exchanged....The army made decisions about what would take place. There were lists of people and prisoners were taken from the lists. One copy was in the hands of the director, and so the police and the director know who was taken away.   People were consistently taken away in small or big groups. The first big group was between June 13 and 30, 1992. Thirty-five people were taken at night. Before that men were taken at night and tortured. After that they disappeared. During the nights, when people were brought to the prison, some of them were in torture chambers, and when they were taken away, they were also tortured. The guards and military police were torturing them.   This witness confirmed that Milorad Krnojelac was the director of the facility, during which time numerous detainees disappeared.   Another Bosniak survivor of KP Dom told Human Rights Watch:   On September 17, they took thirty-five people ostensibly to pick plums, and they never came back. On September 25, they took twenty-five people, and they never came back. Later they took Muradif Music and nineteen others. That was on October 9, 1992. They never came back. I saw each time they took people away. They just called the names and took them away. Always two people came to call the names. They had army uniforms on. [...] My friend had been taken to the basement where he was beaten. I asked...one of the guards, if I could see my friend. He said I can see him for two minutes. He [the friend] was all bruised and black [...]. In the same room where [my friend] was, there was one guy hanging one meter off the floor at the wall. Ropes held him up there and on one side there was hot water falling on one of his shoulders and on the other side there was cold water and he was crying. I did not know him but he was suffering a lot. It was really hot water, and he was really suffering and he was screaming. [The guard] told me not to tell anyone what I saw.   Krnojelac' arrest is the sixth such action by NATO-led SFOR troops in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Despite these arrests, and several surrenders by indictees, at least 45 persons indicted by the ICTY remain at large.","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","International Justice"

""""The ADF has consistently shown a complete disregard for the lives of civilians in this conflict and for the laws of war designed to protect noncombatants,"""" said Jemera Rone, Counsel to Human Rights Watch, """"We call upon the rebel movement to immediately stop targeting civilians, and to stop abducting children for forced conscription into their ranks."""" According to press reports, at about 5:30 a.m. on June 9, 200 to 300 ADF rebels attacked the institute, apparently aiming to abduct the students for conscription into their ranks. The students locked themselves in their dormitories to avoid being abducted. The rebels responded by setting fire to three of the seven residence halls (Kahaya, Rukiidi and Balya residence halls) at the Institute, and the students inside burned to death. The bodies of the victims were burned beyond recognition, making identification and an accurate death toll difficult. The ADF managed to gain access to some of the other dormitories and retreated into the Rwenzuru mountains with the abductees. According to research recently conducted in the region by Human Rights Watch, the ADF is comprised of an alliance between the nationalist National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), which aims to establish an independent kingdom in the region, and disgruntled elements within the Islamist Tabliq sect, who aim to establish an Islamic state in Uganda. The ADF operates bases in the remote Rwenzuru mountains and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and has been active in the region war since re-entering Uganda from the DRC in November 1996. Human Rights Watch conducted a fact-finding mission to the region in April 1998, and documented numerous abuses against civilians by the ADF. According to victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch, one of the reasons the ADF targets civilians is their failure to support the ADF rebellion. Kichwamba and Kabatunda were previously attacked by the ADF on April 9, 1998, leaving sixteen dead and forty-three abducted according to sources interviewed by Human Rights Watch. A survivor of that incident, left for dead by the ADF, told Human Rights Watch that the rebels said that they would not waste their bullets on civilians but would rather cut them to death with machetes: """"They said they were killing us because they were suffering in the bush while the civilians are enjoying life in the town."""" Tens of thousands have been displaced by the conflict, seeking refuge in towns and trading centers and creating a serious humanitarian crisis. Outbreaks of cholera in the overcrowded camps have caused numerous casualties. The ADF has repeatedly targeted schools in attempts to abduct large numbers of children. On August 16, 1997, the ADF attacked St. John's Catholic Seminary in Kiburara, abducting nineteen seminarians aged between twelve and twenty, as well as two young employees. One of the abductees later escaped and told Human Rights Watch that one of the workers had been killed with a machete soon after the abduction in order to terrify the boys. The ADF also abducted students from the Mitande School in Kabarole district in early 1998, and attempted to abduct students from a school at Kabatunda on the night of April 9, 1998, the same evening as the attack on Kichwamba. Human Rights Watch also calls upon the Ugandan government and especially its military, the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF), to respect the human rights of civilians suspected of supporting the ADF rebels. During our April 1998 mission, Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of suspected rebel supporters who were remanded for trial on treason charges. Some of the suspects claimed to have been beaten severely by UPDF soldiers, and had wounds which were consistent with their testimonies. Some of the suspects told Human Rights Watch that they were beaten until they confessed and named other """"rebel collaborators."""" This second group of suspected rebel collaborators was then arrested by the UPDF and allegedly subjected to the same abusive treatment. According to police and judicial authorities, it is routine to detain such suspects for up to one year on the basis of confessions extracted by the army. According to information Human Rights Watch received from UNICEF and NGOs in Uganda, detainees remanded on treason charges also include children. Human Rights Watch calls upon the Ugandan government to stop such abusive practices, and to respect the rights of suspects.","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights"

Yet indiscriminate shelling, summary executions, and the razing of villages that marked the war in Bosnia are now taking place in Kosovo on a daily basis. Human Rights Watch is dismayed that despite the mounting evidence of widespread humanitarian law violations in the region, the international community has repeatedly failed to follow through on warnings to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.     A large-scale offensive by Serbian special police forces and possibly paramilitary units is currently under way in the western part of Kosovo along the border with Albania. Humanitarian aid organizations, journalists, and human rights researchers have been denied access to the region between Pec and Dakovica. Although information on human rights and international humanitarian law violations therefore remains incomplete, there is substantial and credible evidence that serious violations of humanitarian law are taking place. As many as fifty people are reported dead and many more are reported missing from the most recent offensive in the border region around Decan. At least 11,000 people have fled across the mountainous border to Albania. Eyewitnesses report the shelling of civilians by Serb forces, as well as cases of summary execution, in the villages of Ljubenica on May 24, and Poklek in the Drenica region on May 31. Many villages around the town of Decan have been looted, shelled, and set on fire.   Given the mounting evidence of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch calls on all member states of the Contact Group to intensify their pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. While we welcome the reimposition of economic sanctions by the US and member states of the European Union, it is important that these sanctions be tailored expressly to target the Serbian government, President Milosevic, and his associates. Further, it it crucial that the sanctions not be lifted until real improvements in the following areas are met.   Specifically, the Contact Group should demand:  An immediate withdrawal of the Serbian special police forces and any paramilitary units operating in Kosovo;  That the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia halt all long-range artillery shelling and other military operations that are being used to target or indiscriminately fire on civilians;  Unrestricted access to the affected areas in Kosovo by humanitarian organizations, the media, and forensic specialists who can investigate allegations of summary executions, as well as access for diplomats and military attaches from the countries of the Contact Group;  Full disclosure of the names of those currently detained as a result of the conflict, their ages, where they were captured, where they are being detained, and other relevant details;  Full and ongoing access to these detainees for the International Committee of the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations;  That the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian law in Kosovo. Western governments should guarantee ongoing financial and political support to ensure that the ICTY can immediately undertake such an investigation. Further, all governments conducting intelligence operations in and around Kosovo should provide the ICTY with any evidence they obtain relating to the commission of war crimes.  Unrestricted access for the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Former Yugoslavia to investigate violations of humanitarian law by both sides in the crisis region. Further, independent human rights monitors must immediately be granted full access to the crisis region in order to investigate allegations;  The readmission of the OSCE long-term monitoring mission to Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   Human Rights Watch also calls on the Contact Group to appeal to the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA) to respect its obligations under international humanitarian law. In particular, the KLA should release Serbian civilians in detention, refrain from attacks on members of the civilian population and from using any detainees or civilians as hostages, and treat humanely Serbian soldiers or policemen in custody.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/06/04/indonesia-post-soeharto-crisis","Indonesia- The Post-Soeharto Crisis","Indonesia: The Post-Soeharto Crisis","Testimony before the House International Relations Committee Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific by Sidney Jones, Human Rights Watch","06/04/1998","Indonesians have had more freedom in the last two weeks than they have had in the last three decades, but exhilaration is already being replaced by concern over the number of obstacles that lie in the path of political reform. The state of the economy, the weakness of political institutions, and the unfinished power struggle within the elite are just a few of those obstacles.   The U.S. has a critical role to play here to ensure that President Habibie's commitment to reform does not weaken.  It needs to continue to work toward ensuring that Indonesians have an opportunity, as soon as possible, to have a president and parliament of their own choice. Without a leadership that commands popular support, economic recovery will be all but impossible.  It needs to continue to use what economic leverage it has in such a way as to help alleviate the worst hardship most Indonesians will have experienced in their lifetimes but without seeming to give a seal of approval to the Habibie government. The Indonesians we're in touch with on a daily basis -- grassroots organizations from Sumatra to Irian Jaya -- believe that continued conditioning of IMF and donor assistance on following through with political reform is crucial, but so is emergency aid.  It needs to respond to the growing pressure in Indonesia for accountability of the Soeharto government by investigating the assets of the Soeharto family in the U.S. although they are not believed to be extensive. There has been widespread popular support in Indonesia for a suggestion by the National Human Rights Commission in Jakarta that an independent commission of inquiry be set up to look into the Soeharto wealth.  It needs to find ways to enhance support for the nongovernmental organizations and independent media that will be monitoring the new government's actions on political reform and protection of human rights, despite a conservative backlash against the U.S. that has already made itself visible in Jakarta and Surabaya. It also should encourage direct consultation between the new government and NGOs.  It needs to continue to press the army for a full-scale investigation into the disappearances of political activists, four of whom remain missing, and Congress could help by holding hearings on U.S. links with Kopassus, the special forces suspected of involvement in these and other abuses.  It needs to work with other members of the Consultative Group on Indonesia to encourage the new government to begin a reconciliation process with the people of East Timor, a process that can only begin with the release of Xanana Gusmao. But it is critical for those in Congress concerned about East Timor to consult with the leaders of mass organizations in Indonesia, some of whom also support a change in policy toward the territory.  It needs to do all this in a way that encourages and supports the pressures for reform from within Indonesia rather than seeming to create a separate agenda from outside.   Mr. Chairman, I believe there is an urgency to the agenda I have outlined above, because the """"spirit of reform"""" so evident now in Indonesia could be set back by social unrest or contradictory impulses within the political elite. The next three months are going to be key.   That said, I would like to look at the gains and setbacks or """"non-accomplishments"""" of the last two weeks and then address more specifically what the U.S. can do.   The Gains   1. President Soeharto is well and truly gone; he is not sitting behind the scenes pulling the strings of a Jakarta puppet.   2. Independent trade union leader Muchtar Pakpahan has been freed, his union and presumably all others are now free to operate, and the government has announced it is planning to ratify ILO Convention No.87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize.   3. Anyone is free to organize or join the political party of his or her choice, even though the law prohibiting the formation of new parties has not been repealed, and parties are being created or resurrected from the distant past at the rate of about one a day. Golkar, the ruling party, has already been deserted by two factions within it, each of which has formed a party of its own. The political free-for-all is exciting, but it has also brought on unmistakable signs of nervousness within the military.   4. The leading news magazines that were closed down in 1994 are now officially free to reopen and plan on doing so, despite the economic crisis.   5. The Education Ministry has announced an imminent end to the ban on university political activity (the program known as """"Normalization of Campus Life"""") and a suspension of the Pancasila training programs that were widely seen as a kind of political indoctrination program.   6. Soeharto appointees and family members of the political elite are resigning by the dozens from the People's Consultative Assembly or MPR, Indonesia's highest representative body that chooses the president and vice-president and sets the broad guidelines for national policy. These resignations, under popular pressure to end nepotism and corruption, suggest that if this body were to be called into special session in the near future to select a caretaker president or set a date for new elections, it could be far less representative of the old guard than is currently the case (more on this below).   7. President Habibie made a high-profile visit to a major ethnic Chinese area of Jakarta to call for an end to racism and urge those who fled anti-Chinese violence to return to the country.   8. On June 1, a court in Semarang, Central Java, acquitted four East Timorese of transporting bomb-making materials on the grounds that there was no evidence against them. The court threw out the testimony of one witness that had been extracted under torture. To our knowledge, this was the first acquittal ever of East Timorese arrested on charges related to political activity and suggests the highly politicized courts may also be affected by the reform spirit.   9. Public debate is underway now over whether the police should be separated from the armed forces and put under the Ministry of the Interior. (Since the Ministry of Interior traditionally has been led by an army general, the change might be more form than substance, but the idea of separating the police from the army is a sound one.)   The Setbacks   If all of the above steps are welcome and exciting, it must be recognized first, that the popular demand for reform is so great that the Habibie government had little choice but to go with the flow. This should not detract from the value and importance of these measures, but they do not appear to have gained the new government much in terms of credibility or legitimacy. Second, many of these steps have only gone halfway, as in the very limited release of political prisoners, or they require legal changes to give them any kind of permanent underpinning. The fact that political parties are free to form by government fiat does not mean that the pressure should cease for repeal of key laws on the political system.   1. Of the close to 200 political prisoners in Indonesia, dozens of whom are imprisoned for non-violent political activity, only four have been released. Both President Habibie and Justice Minister Muladi have said that political prisoners who are Marxist, opposed to the Indonesian constitution, or convicted for criminal offenses will not be released. Not only should Indonesians have the right to freely express their opinions on any subject, including Marxism and the constitution, but in the case of those detained, the determination of who was a Marxist or an anti-constitutionalist was made by a politicized court system at the behest of a now discredited government. The government's exclusion of these three categories means, among other things, that the eleven students linked to a left-wing party called People's Democratic Party (Partai Rakyat Denokratik) will not be eligible for release. The government has also rejected the release any time soon of Xanana Gusmao.   2. The army continues to play a powerful role, in a way that may slow down or possibly even reverse the reform process in the long term. Gen. Wiranto (commander of the armed forces and Defense Minister) has acted over the past few months almost as a guardian of the student movement, and he appears to have effectively sidelined his rival, Soeharto son-in-law Prabowo, who was widely suspected as being responsible for major human rights violations. Gen.Wiranto has also encouraged a reform movement within the military, announcing, for example, the armed forces' support for a two-term limit for the presidency. But whether the military will permit a review of the concept of its role in social and political affairs (dwifungsi), whether it will support inquiries into past abuses, whether it will follow through with investigation and prosecution of those responsible for the recent """"disappearances,"""" whether its tolerance of free speech and demonstrations will begin to wane as the cacophony of democratic debate moves into high gear, all of these questions are up in the air. Even more problematic is the military's response if the country's economic woes produce more outbreaks of rioting and unrest: then a real unraveling of democratic gains would not only be possible but likely.   3. President Habibie's visit to the ethnic Chinese district of Jakarta was an important step, but it leaves unresolved the question of how Indonesia begins to win back the trust of this part of its population. Anti-Chinese sentiment remains dangerously high, and it may get worse as the economic situation deteriorates. Some of the solutions proposed are frightening: a group in North Sumatra urged the government to do more to encourage ethnic assimilation, a phrase that has been a code word in the past to justify discrimination. A member of parliament in Jakarta has said in the last two days that by fleeing abroad to Singapore and Malaysia (when their homes and shops were being attacked), ethnic Chinese showed a lack of a sense of nationalism, and the assets of all who fled abroad should be investigated. President Habibie himself, instead of promising better protection from the Indonesian security forces at times of unrest, suggested that the ethnic Chinese form their own vigilante squads for self-defense. (In this regard, it is worth noting that the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission said in a statement on June 2, 1998 that the rioting on May 13-14 that led to a death toll now estimated at 1,188 and during which security forces in many areas seemed to stand by unwilling to take action, appeared to have been triggered by an outside group. The Commission called on the government to undertake a full investigation.) It is imperative for the Habibie government and any aspirants to national leadership to tackle the question of how to end discrimination and make Indonesia a safe place for people of all ethnic backgrounds to live. Appointment of a national commission to examine this issue, from the standpoint of equal opportunity and ending discrimination, might be a good place to start. Not only social harmony but also economic recovery depend on finding a solution.   4. The government has announced that it has no plans to change policy on East Timor. No political reform program can be complete without a review of the areas where major human rights violations have been committed and where disaffection with the Indonesian administration is so high that armed guerrilla movements are able to attract significant popular support. Given the investment by the military in East Timor, in terms of time, resources, and human lives, a change in policy will not be easy, but it is important not to let East Timor slide off the reform agenda so easily. Opposition leader Amien Rais has publicly stated his support for a referendum in East Timor, although in recent days he has warned of the dangers of disintegration. Influential members of Nahdlatul Ulama, the largest Muslim organization in the country, as well as many in the Indonesian NGO movement have also urged a change in policy.   5. There is growing concern about the political and economic repercussions of President Habibie's plan to delay parliamentary elections until early 1999 and the selection of a new president until well after that. No solution is ideal, but the option chosen by Habibie appears to guarantee that he will stay in power for almost two years. Given the economic and political problems facing Indonesia, the need for a leader with a popular mandate is more acute than ever.   There are two major proposals on the table for how and when to hold elections, each with several variations, and both rooted in the current Indonesian constitution. President Habibie proposes having a special session of the People's Consultative Assembly or MPR later this year to approve changes to the election and political party laws and to set a new date for elections to the parliament or DPR. (The MPR consists of all 500 members of the DPR plus 500 others appointed by the president and by the parties represented in the DPR.) Those elections would be held in the first half of 1999, and sometime thereafter, the newly elected MPs, joined by their appointed colleagues would meet to elect a new president and vice-president.   A second proposal, favored by several ministers in the current cabinet as well as some opposition leaders, is to call a special session of the current MPR for July to select a new """"caretaker"""" administration that would serve until new parliamentary elections could be held sometime in 1999. Different formulations for the caretaker administration have been proposed, ranging from a single individual to a five-member presidium consisting of four civilians and one military officer. A variant of this proposal would merely lessen the interval between the selection of the caretaker and the holding of parliamentary elections.   The advantage of the first is that the new president would be chosen by a much more representative body than is currently available; the disadvantage is that Habibie, whom many in the country distrust, would stay in power until late 1999. The advantage of the second is that it puts a finite time on Habibie's tenure; the disadvantage is that the selection of a caretaker or caretakers could be highly contentious -- there is no obvious consensus candidate. In response to concerns that the MPR that would select the caretaker is the same old body that elected Soeharto less than two months ago, proponents of this option argue that the combination of popular stigmatization of crony appointees, the process of """"recall"""" whereby existing parties can effectively expel unwanted members, and the reformist atmosphere now prevailing will militate against a non-reformer being chosen.   It is not for the U.S. to favor one option over another, but it could provide a useful service in supporting as many fora for public debate on these issues as possible, encouraging President Habibie to discuss his preferred option with key NGO and student leaders and listen to their reactions, and perhaps funding public opinion surveys whose results can be published in the unrestrained media of today's Indonesia.   Specific Steps the U.S. Can Take   1. There is no question that aid is needed and needed badly. Food shortages are a real danger; delivery of government services is threatened. As recently as last week, we advocated conditioning further disbursements of IMF aid on concrete steps toward political reform, some of which have been taken or promised. If President Habibie makes an effort to consult with the students and NGOs who set the reform process in motion, if he commits himself to a definitive schedule for elections designed to give Indonesia a new president as soon as possible in as open and fair a procedure as possible, if he succeeds in removing legislation from the statutes that penalizes peaceful dissent and restricts political participation, and if he continues to release political prisoners, including those from East Timor, disbursements from international financial institutions should proceed, on the understanding that they can always be suspended again if the political situation deteriorates.   2. The U.S. must end its relationship with Kopassus, the army special forces, until all allegations of past and present abuses have been thoroughly investigated. Those allegations include not only the disappearances of activists from January through March but also the killings recently disclosed that took place in Irian Jaya in 1996 and 1997 during counterinsurgency operations in the Mapnduma area, following the release of researchers taken hostage by the guerrilla group, the Free Papua Movement (OPM). The U.S. and other CGI member countries played a major role in putting pressure on the Indonesian government to find the missing persons; it must not allow that pressure to ease until the remaining four persons are accounted for, and those responsible identified and prosecuted.   3. Freezing Soeharto family assets in the U.S. would be a step much appreciated in Indonesia, particularly at a time of great economic distress. We have not been able to find any comprehensive list of the family's holdings here; they are not likely to be extensive, but this is one case where symbolism is important. Any initiative that Congress can pursue to uncover such assets would be widely welcomed.   4. There appears to be a backlash building among some conservative groups in Indonesia against U.S. support for NGOs involved in the pro-democracy movement, in part because of a perception that the U.S. gave Soeharto the final push. The U.S. should not allow the expression of such sentiments to deter it from support for strengthening civil society at a time of political transition but it may want to explore ways of addressing that backlash.   5. The U.S. should support the positive moves that have taken place without reducing the pressure for further reform. President Habibie should be urged to undertake more releases of political prisoners following the releases that have already occurred and to appoint a commission to address questions of racism and discrimination, particularly against the ethnic Chinese, in the wake of his visit to Glodok, Jakarta.   The general attitude Congress should take toward Indonesia is not that nothing has changed, but that with President Soeharto gone, anything is possible.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Another priority for release must be the 13 elderly men detained for their alleged links to the banned Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia, PKI) _ some of whom have been imprisoned for over three decades. All of these men had trials that were unfair by international standards and many are suffering severe health problems.   Some 170 people have been imprisoned for alleged involvement in violent political activities _ including those from Aceh, Irian Jaya, and East Timor, the three areas where armed insurgencies are active, and those accused of trying to establish an Islamic state.

Police Needs More Resolve In Applying Its Human Rights Mandate","","06/03/1998","In a report released today, Human Rights Watch calls on the United Nations to strengthen its monitoring of the human rights performance of the local police in Bosnia and Herzegovina.   The U.N. Security Council is due to renew the mandate of the International Police Task Force (IPTF), the United Nations police operation in Bosnia, by June 21. The IPTF is the most ambitious civilian police operation ever established by the United Nations, with over 2,000 international police monitors. It has a mandate to screen all applicants for posts in local police, and to assure that individuals who have committed war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, or other serious human rights abuses, during the conflict or since, are prevented from holding any police posts.  After IPTF's first year, the Security Council gave the IPTF the authority to investigate human rights abuses by local law enforcement, and authorized an additional 120 posts to accomplish that task. The new Human Rights Watch report, entitled Beyond Restraint, Politics and the Policing Agenda of the United Nations International Police Task Force, notes with concern that the U.N. has been seriously underusing its human rights mandate, leaving local police to investigate human rights violations_in many cases, trusting the suspected perpetrators to investigate themselves.  """"The moment it has information about human rights abuses, the IPTF should initiate its own investigation,"""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead, official U.N. policy now lets them take an extremely minimal approach."""" Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the screening process is proceeding slowly, due to lack of political resolve. A high turnover of IPTF personnel has led to management failures and institutional memory lapses. Human Rights Watch calls on the international community to assure that no bilateral or multilateral aid is given to the police of a locality of Bosnia and Herzegovina before IPTF completes the vetting process in that locality and that no aid goes to the governments of municipalities in which members of the local police have committed serious human rights abuses or obstructed the implementation of the Dayton agreement and the local government has failed to hold them accountable.

Pius Njawe's conviction of """"spreading false news"""" violated his internationally recognized right to freedom of expression.

He based his report on an investigation by his Le Messager staff and the statements of three witnesses of your alleged heart incident and made no conclusion on the veracity of their statements. Le Messager subsequently published the government's denial of your illness. In publishing the article, Mr. Njawe was simply exercising his right to impart information, in accordance with Article 19 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, to which Cameroon is a party.

Trinidad and Tobago justified its decision as an effort to minimize the cruel and unusual punishment suffered by death row inmates spending more than five years awaiting the imposition of their sentence. The government argued that by withdrawing from the Convention, and thereby eliminating an avenue for appeal, death sentences would be imposed more swiftly.  """"Unfortunately, as political support has grown in the English- speaking Caribbean for taking a 'tough' stand on crime, several governments have expressed interest in applying the death penalty without the constraints imposed by international human rights standards,"""""""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.  Viviana Krsticevic, co-executive director of CEJIL stated, """"If Trinidad and Tobago's government is worried about inhumane treatment on death row, it should be even more worried about the ultimate inhumane penalty - the death sentence.""""  By withdrawing its ratification of the American Convention, Trinidad and Tobago has indicated an unwillingness to protect fundamental human rights and to accept international scrutiny of its human rights practices.  Human Rights Watch and CEJIL stressed that Trinidad and Tobago's decision restricted the rights of all victims of human rights abuse to the protections offered by the inter-American human rights system. The American Convention protects fundamental rights, including the freedoms of conscience, expression, and association, and the rights to participate in government and to a fair trial. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights investigates abuses alleged under the Convention.  Human Rights Watch noted that it had worked closely and effectively with Trinidad and Tobago on a draft statute for the proposed International Criminal Court (ICC). Trinidad and Tobago's withdrawal from the Convention detracted from the country's position as a leading and respected contributor to the ICC drafting process. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Washington, D.C., Tuesday, June 2, 1998 Prime Minister Basdeo Panday Republic of Trinidad and Tobago Port of Spain, Trinidad BY FAX: 868-627-3444 Honorable Prime Minister: We are writing to express our profound regret that on May 26, 1998, your government withdrew its ratification of the American Convention on Human Rights. Your decision denies the Trinidadian and Tobagan citizenry the broad range of human rights protections that are enshrined in the Convention and actively promoted through the work of the Organization of American States' Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The withdrawal of ratification will take effect one year from the date of notification. Rather than embrace participation in this highly respected regional human rights body, your action reveals an unwillingness to endorse fundamental human rights principles and to subject your government's human rights practices to international scrutiny. We urge you to reconsider your withdrawal before it takes effect.  In his May 26 letter to OAS Secretary General César Gaviria, Foreign Minister Ralph Maraj invoked the 1994 Pratt and Morgan case - in which Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London ruled that death row prisoners held for longer than five years had been subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment - to justify expediting appeals """"by the elimination of delays within the system."""" However, your decision to eliminate an avenue of appeal entirely clearly contradicts the spirit of the Pratt and Morgan decision (which requires the commutation of the death sentence in such cases to life imprisonment). Rather than lower the risk that death row prisoners face inhuman treatment, your action has heightened the risk that death row inmates might be wrongly subjected to the most severe punishment, the irrevocable penalty of death.  Human Rights Watch, an independent, nongovernmental human rights organization, opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. Furthermore, we believe that it is often carried out in a discriminatory manner and that the inherent fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons are sometimes executed. Because an execution is irreversible, such miscarriages of justice can never be corrected. For these reasons, Human Rights Watch opposes all executions under law, irrespective of the crime and the legal process leading to its implementation.  While your government has expressed frustration with the pace of death penalty cases before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), your recent action overreaches in seeking a remedy for this concern and restricts the rights of all victims of human rights abuse to access the protections offered by the inter-American human rights system. With this dramatic step, your government has rescinded all of the Convention's broad civil and political rights protections, including the freedoms of conscience, expression and association, and the right to a fair trial. Ironically, the Convention allows the application of the death penalty (but does not allow its extension to new crimes and requires that death row prisoners be permitted to apply for amnesties and commutations).  We are concerned that as political support has grown in the English-speaking Caribbean for taking a """"tough"""" stand on crime, several governments have expressed greater interest in applying the death penalty without the constraints imposed by international human rights treaties and the Privy Council. We are aware that your government also has considered withdrawing from the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Such a step would leave Trinidadian and Tobagan citizens without recourse to the world's and region's most prominent and effective international human rights bodies. We urge you to do all in your power to stem movement in the Caribbean to undermine support for international human rights standards.  The Jamaican government's decisions in the past year to withdraw from the First Optional Protocol (in October 1997) and its issuance of instructions to the Inter-American Commission imposing severe time restrictions on its responses to Jamaican cases were grave blows to Jamaican citizens' rights and to international human rights protections.  Human Rights Watch has had the opportunity to work closely with your government in the process of elaborating a draft statute for the proposed International Criminal Court. Trinidad and Tobago has played a leading and constructive role in that process. We regret that your recent decision to withdraw from the American Convention has detracted from your important contributions to the development of an effective International Criminal Court. We encourage your government to rethink this unfortunate decision before it enters into effect.","Americas, Trinidad and Tobago",""

Shaikh Isa will also meet with Secretary of State Albright. We hope you will find the attached information about Bahrain helpful in covering his visit. Bahrain (pop. 600,000) is a key U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf and serves as headquarters for the Fifth Fleet, comprising some fifteen warships and approximately 1,500 on-shore U.S. military personnel and dependents. During 1997 the U.S. Air Force deployed some twenty fighter bombers there, and several B-1 bombers as well. The State Department estimated that Fiscal Year 1998 military sales to Bahrain would total $201.2 million. Shaikh Isa has been in power since 1961, but this is his first visit to Washington since civil unrest broke out in Bahrain three and a half years ago. In December 1994, long-simmering political tensions exploded when the government arrested and sent into exile several leaders of a petition campaign to restore Bahrain's partially elected parliament, which was disbanded by a decree of the ruling family in 1975. In the wake of the December 1994 crackdown, hundreds of persons have been arrested and tried before State Security Courts, and thousands of others held for long periods without trial. Their alleged offenses have ranged from unlawful assembly and possession of anti-government literature to arson and crude explosive attacks against public and private property. The unrest has claimed more than thirty lives. Questions for President Clinton and Secretary of State Albright: 1) The demands of Bahrain's opposition Popular Petition Committee for basic civil liberties are modest and reasonable: free speech, freedom of association and assembly, and restoration of the Constitution and the partially-elected National Assembly. Why has the Clinton administration failed to support such a program? What has the administration done to encourage Shaikh Isa to pursue dialogue and a political resolution to the crisis? 2) Since January 1996, Bahrain's government has detained without trial nine important leaders of the Shi`a Muslim community, including Shaikh Abd al-Amir al-Jamri, who is elderly and in poor health. There is no evidence that they committed or advocated violence. Have you discussed the case of Shaikh al-Jamri and the others with the Amir? 3) To many people in the Middle East and here at home, U.S silence in the face of gross human rights abuses by Persian Gulf allies such as Bahrain looks like a double standard. Will you make future military sales to Bahrain conditional on improvements in its treatment of its citizens, as required by Section 502 (B) of the Foreign Assistance Act?","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Bahrain, US Foreign Policy",""

The success of the campus-based protest movement in forcing the resignation of President Soeharto and in opening the door to more comprehensive political reform provides an historic opportunity for Indonesia to build a more open and democratic society. We are encouraged by the government's recent embrace of reform initiatives. We believe, however, that on campus as well as elsewhere in society, the push for greater openness can achieve lasting results only if the rights to free expression, association and assembly, so forcefully claimed by students, faculty and alumni in recent months, are given full legal and institutional protection.  Students and faculty emerged at the forefront of the reform movement in large measure because they publicly spoke their minds, courageously and consistently ignoring a variety of repressive laws, regulations, decrees, and abusive practices that have long limited political and intellectual freedom on Indonesia's campuses. Although the momentum of the reform movement has rendered such constraints largely unenforceable for the time being, they continue to exist on paper and in principle, and thus continue to threaten the future autonomy of Indonesia's academic community. We call on the government of Indonesia to dismantle immediately the mechanisms of centralized government and military control over academic life implemented during President Soeharto's thirty-two year New Order rule. The government should immediately take the following steps: 1. Repeal the set of ministerial decrees known collectively as """"Normalization of Campus Life -- Coordinating Body for Student Affairs"""" (Normalisasi Kehidupan Kampus -- Badan Koordinasi Kemahasiswaan or NKK/BKK), decrees which formally prohibit students from engaging in political activity on campus and make university administrators answerable to military authorities and to the central government in Jakarta for violations of the restrictions. The government should also make a public commitment to respecting students' basic rights, including their right to hold peaceful public protest marches. A uniform prohibition on citizens' exercise of basic rights is impermissible no matter where the prohibition is applied. The government in the past justified the ban on student political activity by stating that campuses should be the site of study and research, not political activity, and by asserting that students may engage in political activity through established political parties based off-campus. The government's academic justification is pernicious. Experience has repeatedly demonstrated that academic freedom -- and the spirit of critical inquiry it embodies -- cannot flourish where members of the academic community must fear censorship and politically motivated reprisals for expression of their views. The public demand for political reform unleashed by the campus-based protest movement, moreover, demonstrates that the root of the political crisis in Indonesia was not independent political activity on campus, but the lack of space for such activity off-campus. 2. End all military intervention in campus affairs. This is a prerequisite to academic freedom which is fundamentally compromised when military officials are involved in supervising or consulting with university administrators on the activities of students and faculty. A. Legal and extra-legal military and intelligence agencies, including branches of the military's National Stability Coordinating Agency (Badan Koordinasi Bantuan Pemantapan Stabilitas Nasional or Bakorstanas), should be prohibited from engaging in on-campus intelligence gathering and harassment of students and faculty who make critical comments at seminars or in interviews with the press. B. Campus-based """"student regiments"""" (resimen mahasiswa) should be used solely as a vehicle for recruitment and training of future military personnel, and no longer as an on-campus intelligence network by which military authorities monitor the activities of students. C. Regulations providing for coordination of efforts between university administrators in charge of student affairs (Pembantu Rektor III and Pembantu Dekan III) and military and intelligence officers, also set forth in the NKK/BKK decrees described above, should be immediately repealed. The duties and powers of the university administrators should be reformulated so as to give maximum scope to student autonomy in accordance with academic standards. 3. Repeal the so-called """"special investigation"""" (Penelitian Khusus or Litsus) procedures which require that new teachers and entrants to a range of other """"strategic professions"""" undergo mandatory ideological and political background checks. Individuals should no longer be banned from teaching or be subject to removal on account of their past or present political affiliations or those of their colleagues or family members. Academic merit henceforth should be the sole criterion for hiring and promotion decisions. 4. Abolish mandatory on-campus ideological indoctrination sessions known as """"Guide to the Living and Experiencing of Pancasila"""" (Pedoman Penghayatan dan Pengamalan Pancasila or P4). If civic education is retained, academic values must at all times govern the selection of materials to be covered in the curriculum. 5. Abolish the practice by which government agencies such as the Ministry of Information and the Social and Political Affairs Directorate of the Ministry of Home Affairs maintain blacklists to prevent critical academics, writers and other disfavored individuals from attending campus seminars or stating their views in public media. Regulations requiring that seminar organizers give prior notice to the Ministry of Home Affairs and national police headquarters in Jakarta when foreign speakers are invited to campus should also be repealed. 6. Abolish research permit procedures which give government and military officials effective veto power over proposed academic field research and invite corruption. Academic merit should be the sole criteria by which proposed research is evaluated. 7. The government should cease all media and book censorship. The government censorship """"clearinghouse"""" created in 1989 should be dismantled and the attorney general should be stripped of power to censor books and other printed materials. Although Indonesian law allows members of the academic community to apply for exemptions to use censored materials, in practice the government's censorship of memoirs, literary works and a wide range of foreign and domestic historical and social science texts has had a chilling effect on scholarly inquiry.

Those abuses include mass arbitrary arrests, violation of freedom of religion, and """"disappearing"""" Islamic leaders.  The Human Rights Watch report focuses on abuses committed during widespread, brutal sweeps by the police and security forces beginning in December 1997 in the Farghona Valley, an Islamic stronghold in this Central Asian nation. Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Uzbekistan to cease arbitrary arrest and police brutality and protect peaceful religious expression. It also urges the European Union to suspend implementation of its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Uzbekistan, and the U.S. government to invoke restrictions on assistance to security forces believed to have committed human rights violations.  """"The government is painting all Muslims with the same brush _ those who may have criminal intent, and average Muslims who simply wear a beard or go to the mosque,"""" noted Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"It is subjecting Muslims on a mass scale to beatings, show trials, expulsions from universities and jobs, and lengthy prison terms.""""  According to the 31-page report, which was released to the Uzbekistan government today by a visiting delegation from Human Rights Watch, the police have singled out openly pious Muslims, or dissidents or their relatives, to intimidate and silence them. Human Rights Watch charges that police detained suspects typically without an arrest warrant, planted small amounts of marijuana or several bullets, a handgun, or a grenade on their person, in their car, or in their home during a search, and beat them until they confessed to the crime. Planting such evidence was reportedly so widespread during the crackdown that, according to local residents, men in that area tried to wear clothing without pockets to help deter such set-ups.  The report charges that Uzbekistan's secular government, ruling a rapidly growing population of 22 million, is intolerant of religious expression that it deems too radical or nonconformist. For example government universities have expelled some students on the eve of their college graduation for wearing head scarves or sporting beards as signs of Islamic piety. It has also closed down mosques whose congregations seemed overly loyal to local imams, and """"disappeared"""" at least two popular religious figures in the Farghona Valley.  Islam has played a volatile role in the wars and civil strife in Tajikistan and Afghanistan, both of which border on Uzbekistan. But by prominently denouncing Islamic extremism, the government of President Islam Karimov is trying to focus popular attention on supposed internal enemies to deflect social discontent, the report charges. It described the government as highly repressive in the Soviet style, with heavy censorship, puppet """"alternative"""" political parties, and scores of political prisoners. The poor economy has also bred widespread discontent with the government.  The Human Rights Watch report is meant """"to sound an alarm that the government, by committing serious, wide scale human rights abuse in this volatile area, runs the risk of provoking precisely the radical and even criminal response it has vowed to avert.""""

Human Rights Watch noted that landmines claim an estimated 26,000 victims a year -- the majority of them innocent men, women and children -- so if every country waited eight years to sign, that could mean another 200,000 victims.  """"This is a significant change in U.S. policy,"""" said Stephen Goose, Program Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The debate is no longer if the U.S. should sign the ban treaty, but when, and how we can get there most quickly. By committing to sign the treaty, the U.S. can now be part of the solution to the landmines crisis, not part of the problem.""""  Human Rights Watch calls on the U.S. government to begin immediately exercising its diplomatic influence to convince recalcitrant governments to commit to signing the treaty. """"Now that the U.S. has committed to the treaty, it should do everything it can to convince hold-out states, such as Russia, China, Finland, Turkey, Israel and Egypt to sign,"""" said Goose. """"The U.S. ability to bring other nations on board, and to encourage compliance with the treaty, could be a tremendous asset to the ban movement and save many lives and limbs in the long run,"""" he said.  The announcement stops the disturbing backsliding in U.S. landmine policy since last fall. But, Human Rights Watch is very disappointed that the Administration felt the need to give itself an out by declaring it will only sign in 2006 if its search for alternatives has been successful. """"The `need for alternatives' argument rings very hollow,"""" Goose said.  Many military experts believe alternatives already exist. Two years ago, fifteen of the most senior and respected retired U.S. generals told the president, """"Given the wide range of weaponry available to military forces today, antipersonnel mines are not essential. Thus, banning them would not undermine the military effectiveness or safety of our forces, nor those of other nations."""" Already, 126 governments, including every other member of NATO except Turkey, have signed the Mine Ban Treaty, indicating their willingness to give up the weapon now and to use alternatives in existence. """"The weapon has already been declared illegal by the vast majority of the world's nations,"""" said Goose. """"It has been banned because it is indiscriminate and causes excessive harm to civilians. You can't continue to use an illegal weapon while waiting to develop alternatives,"""" he said.  A notable element of the announcement was that the U.S. will also give up the antipersonnel mines contained in so-called """"mixed mine systems,"""" which combine antipersonnel and antitank mines in a single canister. Since last September the Pentagon has insisted on re-labeling those antipersonnel mines as """"submunitions"""" in order to exempt them from any future ban.  Human Rights Watch is a founder of the U.S. Campaign to Ban Landmines and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL). In 1997, the ICBL was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. Human Rights Watch is working to support the speedy ratification, universalization and implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty. It will be participating in an upcoming meeting on landmines in Moscow, Russia from May 27-29, 1998.

The three organizations -- Human Rights Watch, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, and the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH) -- warned that two prominent women lawyers, Shirin Ebadi and Mehrangiz Kar, could now be at risk of attack by religious vigilantes.  The comments were made on April 12, 1998, during a discussion in the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majles, or parliament) about an amendment to Article 6 of the Press Law, concerning media coverage of women's issues. Majles member Dr. Marzieh Wahid Dastjerdi referred to people who had debated women's rights issues in the press, and made clear references to articles by prominent lawyers, threatening that """"we are going to deal with these people ourselves."""" Although Dr. Dastjerdi did not name the women lawyers, it was clear in that context that the lawyers were Shirin Ebadi and Mehrangiz Kar, who have been outspoken advocates of greater rights for women in Iran. In the past, vigilante violence has followed the statements of government officials criticizing individuals or institutions. For example, at a medical conference in Tehran on May 12, Dr. Dastjerdi strongly criticized an Iranian surgeon who had spoken out on against a proposed law on gender segregation in health care. One day later, vigilantes of the Ansar-e Hezbollahi, or Partisans of the Party of God, attacked and beat the surgeon.  """"We recognize that opposing points of view should be recognized in the course of parliamentary debates,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"But the words of parliamentarians should not legitimize political violence by zealots.""""

His Excellency Hojatoleslam Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri Speaker of the Islamic Consultative Assembly Tehran Iran May 19, 1998 Your Excellency: The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights, three independent non-governmental organizations which work for the promotion and protection of human rights around the world, are writing to you to express their concern over comments made by a member of the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majles) about prominent women lawyers in Iran. We fear that these comments may place the lawyers at risk of attack by vigilantes, and have a chilling effect on the ability of lawyers to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, to the detriment of respect for the rule of law in the Islamic Republic of Iran.  During discussion in the Majles on April 12, 1998 about the amendment to Article 6 of the Press Law concerning the representation of women and the coverage of women's issues, Majles member Dr. Marzieh Wahid Dastjerdi referring to those who had debated women's rights issues in the press and making clear references to articles by prominent lawyers, threatened that """"we are going to deal with these people ourselves."""" Although the women lawyers were not named in this instance it was clear from the references made that the women referred to were the lawyers Shirin Ebadi and Mehrangiz Kar.  While we recognize that opposing points of view should be expressed in the course of parliamentary debates, the words of parliamentarians should not legitimize political violence by zealots - such as the so called Partisans of the Party of God, (Ansar-e Hezbollahi), - who take into their own hands the enforcement of religious orthodoxy. There is a pattern of statements by government officials or parliamentarians criticizing individuals or institutions being followed by vigilante violence. For example, on May 12, at a Medical conference in Tehran, an Iranian surgeon who spoke out against a proposed law on gender segregation in health care was first strongly criticized by Dr. Dastjerdi, and one day later, beaten by Ansar-e Hezbollahi vigilantes at the same conference. The Minister of the Interior, Hojatoleslam Abdollah Nouri, apologized to the surgeons, but no action has been taken to apprehend or prosecute these vigilantes.  The United Nations Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers adopted by the Eighth UN Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders and welcomed by the 45th General Assembly of the UN, with the assent of the Islamic Republic, on December 14, 1990, sets out guarantees necessary for the functioning of lawyers. They provide in Principle 16 that:  Governments shall ensure that lawyers a) are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference;...  In relation to lawyers' right to freedom of expression and association the Basic Principles provide in Principle 23:  ...In particular, they [lawyers] shall have the right to take part in public discussion of maters concerning the law,...

The horrendous violence in Jakarta on May 14 and 15 left an estimated 500 dead, and there were other deaths as rioting swept through the cities of Solo, Yogyakarta, Semarang, Surabaya, Medan, Bandar Lampung, Palembang, and Ujung Pandang. While an uneasy calm seems to have been restored nationwide as of this writing, the likelihood of another round of violent unrest is high as long as fundamental economic and political problems remain unresolved.   Last week's appalling carnage and destruction aimed at symbols of wealth -- banks, shopping malls, automobile showrooms, and ethnic Chinese-owned homes and shops -- diverted attention temporarily from the peaceful, student-led movement for democratic reform. But student leaders, still mourning the deaths of six of their colleagues last Tuesday, are planning coordinated nationwide demonstrations on May 20, and their calls for Soeharto to step down have now been joined by an extraordinary range of groups and individuals in the country, from the Sultan of Yogyakarta to leaders of the Kosgoro faction of the ruling party, Golkar. Contrary to some predictions, the rioting has not frightened the middle class and the political elite into seeing Soeharto as the only person standing between them and anarchy. Instead, it may have convinced them that the only way to protect their interests is for him to go.   With strength in numbers, Indonesians have lost all fear of speaking out. Calls from the military's information bureau to several newspapers over the weekend, warning them about publishing any further speculation about whether Soeharto would resign, appear to have gone completely unheeded. Amien Rais, a prominent opposition leader who was in Washington in late April, said on Sunday that in the aftermath of the rioting, it should not be just the looters of stores who were punished but the looters of the state as well. Nurcholish Majid, another well-known Muslim intellectual, called on Soeharto to turn over his own wealth and that of his family to the state, as one step toward """"total reform."""" Today's editions of major Indonesian dailies printed the remarks of both men in full. On Friday, the Ministry of Information tried to curb the broadcast media as well, setting up a """"crisis center"""" to screen any news bulletins on riots, demonstrations, or calls for reform not produced by the government itself, but the Indonesian public has grown too sophisticated for that kind of manipulation.   Mr. Soeharto's announced intention of reshuffling his cabinet, even if it were to result in the removal of his daughter and several cronies, is doomed as a """"reform"""" gesture before it starts. It has already been dismissed as meaningless by leading Indonesian commentators, although it could have decidedly negative implications if it involved the removal of General Wiranto, seen by students and opposition figures as one of the moderates in the senior officer corps, from his position as Minister of Defense. Today's call for Soeharto's resignation by Harmoko, speaker of the Indonesian parliament, followed by his apparent backtracking, is only one indication of the tense political maneuvering going on at the highest levels of government.   In this regard, President Clinton's call on Friday for the Indonesian government to """"initiate quickly a dialogue on reform with its citizens"""" may also be too late. At this stage, even if the government agreed to discuss a key demand of the pro-democracy movement -- the repeal of five laws that define the current political system -- that discussion would mean little to the opposition unless the issue of how and when Soeharto would step down were also on the table. Nevertheless, both the statement issued by the White House press office on Friday and the G-8 call on Saturday for political reform in Indonesia were welcome initiatives. The task is now to push harder, as I will explain below.   Mr. Chairman, many commentators have suggested that the violence of the last several days was due directly to the hardships imposed by the International Monetary Fund program in Indonesia. I would like to make three points in this regard.   First, both political and economic frustrations have been building in this country for years. We had a foretaste of how lethal the convergence of those two could be in July 1996 in Jakarta, when rioting erupted after the army-backed storming of the headquarters of Megawati Soekarnoputri. The rioters were by and large the same kind of underclass that rampaged through Jakarta last week. The trigger in 1996 was political, because so many people identified with Megawati. The trigger two years later, while linked in part to the increase in fuel prices, was the killing of the six students, since the student movement had gradually attracted enormous public sympathy. If indeed the riots were a spontaneous outburst of anger, the difference in scale between 1996 and 1998 can be explained by the massive increase in numbers of the urban poor as a result of layoffs and general economic hardship, but it is important to note that the frustrations did not suddenly materialize this year.   Second, it is simply not credible any longer to maintain that economic stabilization is the key to political stability in Indonesia. It is difficult to see how any economic reform program or rescue package can work when there is no government in place with the legitimacy and popular support needed to implement austerity measures and when the words """"corruption,"""" """"collusion,"""" and """"nepotism"""" have come to define the Soeharto administration.   Finally, it would be a serious misreading of the situation to say either that additional assistance from the IMF would stop the turmoil or that holding back on such aid would increase it. The rot in the political system is too deep for any economic measures to have any lasting impact in the absence of political change.   Human Rights Violations   One of the key questions in the Jakarta violence -- and one being asked me via e-mail by many Indonesian Chinese students worried about their parents and families -- is why in so many areas the security forces stood by and apparently allowed arson and looting to take place. Several explanations have been put forward, none of them proven, from the security forces simply being outnumbered, to an unwillingness to be seen defending the property of the rich, to deliberate instigation for a larger political goal. (The instigation theory is widely believed, although the evidence we have seen so far is weak.) But it was inevitable in any outbreak of violence that ethnic Chinese property would be targeted, and it was almost inevitable after the killings of the six students that unrest would erupt. It is at least worth asking the question why the security forces should have been so carefully deployed around campuses to prevent peaceful student marches and so woefully unprepared to deal with a far more serious threat.   The shootings last Tuesday of unarmed Indonesian students at Trisakti University--one of the immediate causes of the violence on Thursday and Friday -- were an inexcusable use of lethal force by Indonesian security forces, all the more so because several reports suggest that the students were inside the campus gates when they were shot. The security forces opened fire after a day-long peaceful demonstration on the Trisakti campus in support of political reform. The students had wanted to march to the parliament building but were prevented from doing so by a joint team of military police, the army, the regular police, and the mobile police brigade. The dean of the law faculty had negotiated an end to a standoff between students and troops just outside the campus, getting the students to withdraw back on to campus grounds if the troops withdrew as well. As the students were going back through the campus gates in an orderly fashion, a group surrounded a man they believed to be an intelligence agent and reportedly attempted to beat him up. In a sequence of events that remains unclear and needs a fully independent investigation, the scuffle over the alleged intelligence agent attracted the attention of other students, the security forces moved in on them, beating and kicking as they did so, and youths who may not have been students and who were well outside the campus began throwing bottles and rocks at the troops. It was apparently in an atmosphere of a complete melee that troops opened fire.   The Trisakti students were not the first to die in the current standoff between students and security forces, although they were the first to be killed by troops opening fire. In Yogyakarta, Central Java, on May 8, Mozes Gatotkaca, a forty-year-old graduate of the Yogyakarta Industrial Academy, died after his skull was fractured by police during a demonstration. The next day, an undercover police intelligence agent named Lt. Dadang Rusmana died of head wounds in Bogor after he was beaten by a group of demonstrators. In addition, there have been many students injured by rubber bullets as police have used force to prevent students from taking their message off campus. Six students were hospitalized in Bengkulu, Sumatra on May 9 after thousands of students from all over the city joined high school students on the campus of Bengkulu University, for example, and five were wounded on May 16 in Medan, North Sumatra.   In all of these cases, had the students been allowed to exercise their right to freedom of assembly beyond campus grounds, the clashes resulting in injuries and deaths would not have occurred. It is important to note, moreover, that none of those arrested during the three days of rioting in Medan from May 4-6 nor during the rioting in Jakarta, Solo, or Surabaya last Thursday and Friday have been students. The student-led movement for political reform, and the mob violence against the perceived rich, are not the same, although they both reflect the depth of resentment against the Soeharto government.   The disappearances of political activists remain unresolved, although with two more individuals coming forward after resurfacing to tell their stories, the evidence pointing to the army is stronger and stronger. Andi Arief, the leader of a banned militant student body who disappeared on March 28 and resurfaced a month later in Jakarta police headquarters, said two of his captors had just returned from East Timor. Pius Lustrilanang, one of the disappearance victims who resurfaced and who testified before the House of Representatives on May 7, said he talked to two men held in the same building he was who had been taken to the North Jakarta district military headquarters before being brought to the building concerned. Sonny, 33, and Yani Avri, also known as Rian, 27, were supporters of the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) but also were suspected of planning to use explosives. They were arrested in May 1997 at the time of the national election campaign in Indonesia, held for one night by the North Jakarta district military, then taken to the place where Pius eventually ended up. Sonny and Rian were there when Pius arrived, and they were taken out on March 16 at about 11:30 p.m. and are now believed to be in Jakarta police custody. Surely, the Jakarta police know precisely who is behind the disappearances.   Other leading activists have been threatened. An East Timorese student leader in Yogyakarta named Hortencio Pedro Vieira has been attacked three times by unidentified men after receiving threats from the Yogyakarta police command. Pedro, a political science major at Gajah Mada University and a strong supporter of East Timorese independence, is reported to have been shot at on March 4, 1998 by a group of six men on three motorcycles, all dressed in civilian clothes. A week later, on March 11, Pedro was one of the students involved in the burning of Soeharto in effigy on the Gajah Mada campus. On April 2 and again on May 13, Pedro was reported to have been in danger of being deliberately shot during demonstrations at Gajah Mada, and some of the students detained for questioning at the Yogyakarta police headquarters said they were questioned about their relations with Pedro and about his activities more generally. The threats against Pedro are particularly serious, given the recent wave of disappearances and the fact that at least one East Timorese, Lucas da Costa, a lecturer at Darma Cendika University in Surabaya, is known to have been detained in the same place that Pius Lustrilanang and the other activists were held. Da Costa disappeared on December 23, 1997 and only reappeared in mid-January.   Political trials continue to go on across Indonesia in the midst of the turmoil, highlighting precisely the kind of problems that political reform must address. On May 8, the case of six political activists accused of convening a """"People's Congress"""" in Jakarta in March went to trial in North Jakarta district court. The six, led by performance artist Ratna Sarumpaet, have been charged under a rarely used law banning political activities, Law No.5/1963, that carries a maximum five-year sentence. Ratna herself was the coordinator of SIAGA, a political organization supporting the candidacy of opposition leaders Megawati Soekarnoputri and Amien Rais instead of Soeharto and Habibie for the country's top posts. The Congress was to take place just before the """"election"""" of Soeharto to a seventh term by a body called the People's Consultative Assembly in Jakarta.   In East Timor in mid-April, Manuel Viegas Carrascalao, older brother of the former governor of East Timor and a former member of the East Timor provincial parliament himself, was formally investigated as a suspect for his role in founding the Movement for Reconciliation and Unity of the People of East Timor in November 1997. Two other founding members, Maria Quintao Viana do Carmo (also a former local parliament member) and Drs. Francisco Lopes de Carvalho, were expected to be questioned later this month. All of the three are free at the moment but are expected to eventually face trial. Manuel Carrascalao founded the movement in October 1997 after a falling out with the governor of East Timor, Abilio Soares. In December, the movement was banned in the district of Lautem because it questioned whether East Timor should be part of Indonesia. On January 10 and again on January 19, the provincial police command summoned Carrascalao and the two others for questioning with regard to the organization. Later that month, the group received threats from an East Timorese gang known as """"Sete-Sete"""" or """"Seven-Seven"""" and known to be working with the government. The gang warned of harsh action against Carrascalao's movement if it continued with its activities.   What the U.S. Should Do   In the midst of this political crisis, the U.S. does not have a great deal of leverage, but it can certainly join forces with other donor countries, as it did at the G-8 meeting in Birmingham, to continue to press for meaningful political reform. Most importantly, the U.S. should take the lead within the Consultative Group on Indonesia, a donor consortium, to try to ensure that any economic assistance to Indonesia -- with the exception of humanitarian assistance, scholarship aid, and programs to strengthen civil society -- is made conditional on concrete steps toward easing controls on freedom of association, expression, association and political participation. If possible, funding for human rights organizations around the country and for strengthening the independent media should be increased.   While it is clear that the military, or some part of it, will play a key role in the first post-Soeharto government, the U.S. must find a way to maintain channels of communication with junior and senior officers without providing any kind of training in skills that could be likely used against an internal enemy. Pending the outcome of a full investigation into the disappearances of activists and the shooting of the Trisakti students, there should be a total ban on any joint training or exercises. The U.S. should also work with other donors to persuade them to adopt a ban on transfers of equipment that is likely to be used in the commission of human rights violations.   The U.S. should join with other donors in pressing Indonesia to extend invitations to key parts of the U.N. human rights machinery, including the Special Rapporteur on Torture, given the serious torture to which the disappeared activists were subjected, and the Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions. In the past when rapporteurs have visited, their attention has been focused exclusively on East Timor. That focus should be broadened to include Indonesia proper.   Most importantly the U.S. should convey to possible Soeharto successors the kind of steps that would be viewed by the international community as indicative of a commitment to political reform and protection of human rights. Those steps should include:   1. The release of all people detained for non-violent political activities or who have been charged under the following laws PP 11/1963 (the anti-subversion law); Law No.5/1963 (a law banning all political activities); Article 154-156 of the Criminal Code (spreading hatred toward the government); Articles 134-136 of the Criminal Code (insulting the head of state).   2. The repeal of all of the above laws.   3. The repeal of the package of five political laws from 1985 that freeze the political system in its current form, including Law No.3 1985 on elections, Law No.5 1985 on political parties and Law No.8 1985 on mass organizations.   4. The release of imprisoned East Timorese leader Xanana Gusmao with a view toward establishing a direct dialogue on human rights.   5. Announcement of a new policy aimed at ending de facto and de jure discrimination against the ethnic Chinese.   6. The establishment of a high level civilian-military commission including representatives of NGOs, to review the """"dual function"""" of the Indonesian military in society.   7. The establishment of an anti-corruption commission or other mechanisms designed to curb corrupt practices and make public officials more accountable.   8. The adoption of measures to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.   9. Ratification of major international human rights treaties.   10. Eventually, perhaps not immediately, the establishment of a Truth Commission that would investigate the events of September-October 1965 and the killings that followed.","Asia, China and Tibet, Indonesia",""

A man of principle and courage, Sendashonga was widely hailed as a leader of moderation. A second person, an unidentified driver, was slain at the same time.  Leader of a student movement opposed to Rwandan president Juvenal Habyarimana, Sendashonga left Rwanda in 1975. Sendashonga, a Hutu, was recruited by the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) to serve as its liaison with the predominantly Hutu political parties within Rwanda that were opposed to the Habyarimana regime. When the RPF established a government in July 1994, Sendashonga became Minister of the Interior, putting his considerable prestige at the service of the coalition government and so attracting many other moderate Hutu to its support.  Just over a year later, he left the government to protest abuses by the Tutsi-dominated army against civilians, most of them Hutu. He had asked the Rwandan Vice-President and Minister of Defense General Paul Kagame repeatedly to restrain his troops, noting their abuses in some 600 memoranda addressed to Kagame. Several months after leaving government, Sendashonga fled Rwanda for exile in Nairobi.  Sendashonga also firmly condemned the 1994 genocide in which Hutu extremists killed more than half a million Tutsi. In the intervening years, he refused to support the current insurgency against the Rwandan government because it was led by soldiers responsible for the genocide.  A first attempt at assassinating Sendashonga failed in February 1996, although both he and a nephew were wounded in the attack. A man apprehended with a firearm at the site of the attack was identified as an employee of the Rwandan embassy in Nairobi. Although arrested, the assailant was never prosecuted by Kenyan authorities.  Human Rights Watch and FIDH call upon Kenyan authorities to investigate this assassination promptly and thoroughly and to bring the perpetrators to justice. The two international human rights organizations also urge the rest of the international community to insist that the assassin or assassins be brought to justice and to offer their assistance to the Kenyan government in this effort.","Africa, Kenya, Rwanda","International Justice"

U.S. officials at the highest levels are now formulating the American position on the ICC.     """"The ICC would target those responsible for the worst human rights crimes personally,"""" writes Executive Director Kenneth Roth. """"When tomorrow's tyrant contemplates genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity, an effective ICC would make him think twice.""""     Roth criticizes the current U.S. position insisting on """"iron-clad, 100 percent guarantees"""" that no American citizen could ever face an ICC prosecution, and explains that such guarantees would create significant barriers to bringing a citizen of any state before the court. Roth calls on Clinton to accept instead the """"strong guarantees"""" against frivolous prosecution already written into the draft ICC statute.     Roth recognizes that the U.S., as a global military power, bears special responsibilities for maintaining peace. But he enumerates the following """"strong guarantees"""" already in the statute: """"complementarity,"""" or the ability of national courts to prosecute their own criminals before such cases could come before the ICC; """"procedural checks,"""" including an extensive pre-trial screening process for all cases; and the """"selection of judges and prosecutor,"""" which would subject all nominees to standards of the highest professionalism.     Roth urges Clinton to reject the following """"absolute guarantees:"""" approval by the United Nations Security Council, which would paralyze the court by giving permanent members of the Security Council a veto over the court's docket; state consent to individual prosecutions, which would paralyze the court by giving all states the right to stop cases concerning them from going forward; and limits on the prosecutor's ability to start his or her own investigations.     Roth notes the opposition to an effective and independent ICC from Sen. Jesse Helms, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and from the U.S. Department of Defense. His letter calls on Clinton to overrule the short-sighted objections from these quarters, and to back an international criminal court that can truly hope to end impunity for the world's most terrible crimes.","United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

In field investigations in Africa and elsewhere, Human Rights Watch has discovered that abusive forces are often supplied by private arms traffickers who elude official controls_if such controls exist at all. Consequently, the illegal arms trade constitutes a serious human rights concern.  In the case of the Great Lakes region in Africa, which has been the scene of large-scale humanitarian disasters including genocide, Human Rights Watch has documented a steady inflow of weapons through private traffickers who use Europe and South Africa as headquarters and safe havens.  The measures that the G-8 are currently considering_harmonization of export/import documentation, marking of firearms, exchange of information, etc._would all be positive steps. Yet it will be important to clarify three points:  The G-8 appears to be focusing on the use of firearms in crime. Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organizations believe that the primary focus should be on the use of small arms and light weapons_generally_in armed conflict.  Most serious abuses in post-Cold War conflicts have been committed with precisely these kinds of weapons, which have made conflicts more protracted and lethal, and have emboldened abusive actors and thereby encouraged a climate of impunity.  Unprotested arms supplies to Rwanda in the period leading up to the 1994 genocide, for example, are certain to have provided the perpetrators of the genocide not only with arms but also with a sense of invincibility and impunity.  The G-8 should tackle the illicit trade in weapons, but must not neglect the private arms trade in general. In particular, Human Rights Watch urged the G-8 to make sure that arms traders are not receiving licenses for the sale of weapons to known human rights abusers.  Governments have a responsibility to make sure that these kinds of sales are not permitted. It would be all too easy otherwise for governments to covertly supply arms to abusive forces, all the while hiding behind the excuse of a private trade gone wild.  Most importantly, in addition to the private trade, the G-8 should also work toward a strict and binding international code of conduct that will prevent the transfer of weapons by states to other states or to non-state actors that are engaged in serious abuses of human rights or international humanitarian law.  As in cases such as Rwanda, serious abuses of human rights, including genocide, are committed not only by non-state actors, but by governments that have been supplied by other governments.  Human Rights Watch has documented how various states provided weapons to Rwanda before and even during the genocide.  In the case of Turkey, which has committed serious abuses of international humanitarian law in its fight with the Kurdish Workers Party in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq, the United States has provided almost all of the weaponry with which these abuses have been committed.  """"Governments supply weapons, overly or covertly, to clients that abuse human rights, and governments fail to stop private arms sales to such clients,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms division of Human Rights Watch. """"So we believe that governments, including the United States, have a moral responsibility to address the problem of illicit arms trafficking.""""  He added: """"With these three important caveats in mind, Human Rights Watch wholeheartedly endorses the G-8's announced intent to tackle the illicit trade in firearms at its summit in Birmingham.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Arms"

With Jakarta and other Indonesian cities wracked by rioting, Human Rights Watch urged leaders of the countries known as the G-8 to recognize the urgency of political reform if social order and economic prosperity are to be restored in the world's fourth largest country.  The G-8 leaders should use their influence within the International Monetary Fund and other international financial institutions to suspend any further economic assistance -- save for humanitarian aid and aid specifically designed to strengthen civil society -- until controls on freedom of association, expression, and assembly are eased. Those controls include laws banning the emergence of new political parties and structures that permit the intervention of the military in virtually all aspects of social and political life. In addition, Human Rights Watch said, the G-8 leaders, while deploring the violence that has rocked Indonesian cities, should call for restraint on all sides and remind Indonesia of its obligation, even in the midst of crisis, to respect human rights. There is deep concern in Indonesia that a declaration of martial law might be imminent, a step that would only strengthen the role of the military, facilitate rights abuses, and fuel resentment against the government.  The G-8 leaders should express concern about targeting of ethnic Chinese and urge present and future leaders of Indonesia to specifically condemn attacks on Chinese homes and shops and call for the inclusion in any political reform program of steps to end to discrimination against minorities. The G-8 leaders should also collectively reiterate the concern already expressed by some governments in the group over the abduction, disappearance, and torture of political activists in recent months and the need for an impartial investigation into both the disappearances and the shooting of unarmed students on May 12.

Human Rights Watch urged all member countries of the World Bank-chaired Consultative Group on Indonesia (CGI) to condition all non-humanitarian assistance to Indonesia, including their contributions to the International Monetary Fund, on the lifting of legal and administrative controls on the rights to freedom of assembly, expression, and association. It joined Indonesian human rights organizations in calling on the Indonesian government to invite the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Summary and Arbitrary Executions to the country as a matter of urgency to investigate these latest deaths. Human Rights Watch also joined Amnesty International in calling for a complete review by CGI member countries of military and security assistance to Indonesia in the wake of the deaths with a view toward halting transfers that could be used in human rights abuses.  """"These killings were completely avoidable,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"It was an inexcusable use of lethal force against unarmed students and can only lead to a worsening of an already explosive situation."""" Evidence suggests that the security forces who fired down on the students from a highway overpass used live ammunition, despite the army's claim at a press conference that it used only rubber bullets and tear gas. According to one report, eleven persons were seriously injured, many of them with gunshot wounds, and seventeen had lighter injuries.  Human Rights Watch said the death toll might well rise, as two students were reported to be in a coma, and local human rights organizations were investigating reports of other deaths. Of the six known dead, all were enrolled at Trisakti University, a private university in central Jakarta where the shootings took place. Three of the victims, Alan Mulyadi, Vero, and Hendrawan, were economics students. Elang Mulia Lesmana was an architecture student, Hafidi Alfidin was in civil technology, and Heri Heriyanto was an industrial techonology major. The six have quickly acquired the status of martyrs and are already being called """"Heroes of the Reformation.""""  Adi Andojo, the dean of the Trisakti law faculty, a respected former Supreme Court justice who was forced to step down after raising concerns about corruption within the court, said he was registering a protest against the security forces. """"My students did not resist, they did not throw stones, they did not use violence,"""" he told a local newspaper.  The security forces opened fire after a day-long peaceful demonstration on the Trisakti campus had dispersed. The students had wanted to march to the parliament building to carry their message urging political reform, but were prevented from doing so by a joint team of military police, the army, the regular police, and the mobile police brigade. Dean Andojo himself had negotiated an end to a standoff between students and troops just outside the campus, getting the students to withdraw back on to campus grounds if the troops withdrew as well.

Any investigation must include an inquiry into exactly where, how, and by whom the students were killed, and the circumstances under which lethal force was used.  Had the students been allowed to exercise their right to freedom of assembly beyond campus grounds, the shootings would not have occurred. More importantly, had the Indonesian government made a move toward lifting existing controls on participation in political activities, a way out of the escalating protests might have been found. Instead, the government decided to try to blockade students in their universities, ignore calls for reform, and deny students and other Indonesian citizens their fundamental civil rights.  In confronting the violence that did take place, the armed forces violated fundamental international principles set forth in the """"Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials,"""" a set of United Nations standards. Among the principles that appear to have been violated are that law enforcement officials should exercise restraint in the use of force and act in proportion to the nature of the threat they face; """"minimize damage and injury and respect and preserve human life""""; and use firearms only when less dangerous means are not practicable.  The killings came a time of increased human rights violations by the Indonesian government, including a rash of """"disappearances"""" of political activists in February and March. While most of the """"disappeared"""" resurfaced in recent weeks with reports that they had been held in a safehouse and tortured, several are still unaccounted for.","Asia, Indonesia","Free Speech"

Cartner noted that just a week ago Mr. Birdal was the luncheon guest of the US ambassador to Turkey.

Authorities detained him for twenty-four hours and expelled him. The human rights organization considers this arrest as part of a systematic government campaign aimed at silencing the vibrant local human rights community through the intimidation and arbitrary detention of activists. It urges the DRC government to immediately release all detained Congolese human rights advocates and to uphold their rights to monitor and speak out on human rights concerns in the country. The letter of Human Rights Watch to the DRC government is attached.  May 13, 1998 His Excellency President Laurent Desiré Kabila, President of the Republic Kinshasa - Ngaliema Democratic Republic of the Congo Fax: +243 88 02120 Your Excellency: We are writing to protest in the strongest terms the arrest of the Human Rights Watch researcher Suliman Baldo on the evening of Friday, May 8, at the Kinshasa Ndjili airport. Mr. Baldo was leaving the country after conducting a three-week human rights mission, which had been clearly stated on his visa application. We consider this incident to be part of your government's campaign to silence and isolate Congolese human rights and civil society organizations, and to send a message to their colleagues in the international human rights movement that contact with local activists will no longer be tolerated.  At the airport, agents of the National Intelligence Agency (ANR) confiscated documents found in Mr. Baldo's luggage, including newspaper clippings and public reports written by local human rights groups. Agents accused him of possession of """"subversive literature"""" with the intention of propagating lies about the DRC government outside the country and of espionage for having contacted """"banned"""" human rights organizations and opposition parties. At one stage, the general inspector of the ANR's station at the airport, who was leading the interrogation, threatened to apply what he described as the """"Congolese method"""" by ordering a soldier to beat up Mr. Baldo, apparently in an attempt to compel him to divulge information on his contacts and sources to the interrogators. Mr. Baldo was kept under constant military guard and was forced to spend the night in a holding cell in a military camp adjacent to the airport. Three other civilians accused of petty theft were also held in that cell. Finally, after 24 hours of detention and interrogation, Mr. Baldo was allowed to leave the country on Saturday evening.  This incident came in the wake of a series of similar attacks on local human rights groups, apparently aimed at silencing them through harassment and arbitrary detentions. In some cases detained rights activists were severely tortured. While it was true that only one human rights organization, the Association for the Defense of Human Rights (AZAHDO), was dissolved by an administrative measure of questionable legality, your government recently published a list of twenty-two officially-recognized rights organizations from among about a hundred such organizations operating in the country. Nevertheless, in late April, Paul Nsapu and Sabin Banza, two leaders of the """"League of Electors,"""" which is among the officially-recognized organizations, were arrested while leaving the Belgian embassy in Kinshasa. The two remain in detention to this day.  Rights defenders in the eastern town of Goma continue to face a severe crackdown meant to ensure their silence on abuses occurring there. One activist from the Goma-based association """"Grand Vision"""" has been detained since January 1998 and another was severely tortured by the military in late March. In early May, two leading women activists from Goma were arrested. Activists from other civil society associations in Goma have left the region in fear of their lives.  The arrest of a visiting human rights activist is obviously meant to throw the local groups in further disarray and to weaken their interaction with their international counterparts. We call on your government to halt arbitrary arrests, intimidation and acts of violence targeting human rights defenders and members of nonviolent civilian organizations. We urge your government to recognize the rights of human rights advocates in the Congo to monitor, investigate, and publicly speak out on human rights concerns and to associate freely with others nationally and internationally in order to promote and protect human rights in the DRC.

Olisa Agbakoba, founding president of the Civil Liberties Organisation and convenor of the United Action for Democracy, a coalition of Nigerian pro-democracy groups, was arrested by the State Security Service at Lagos' international airport on Friday, May 8, as he was returning from Accra, Ghana. No reason has been given for the arrest. Agbakoba has begun a hunger strike to protest the conditions of his detention which fail to meet international standards. According to the United Action for Democracy, he has been denied access to both legal representation and his family, and is being held in solitary confinement. His conditions for ending the hunger strike include being permitted visits and food parcels from his family as well as access to medication and basic toiletries. He suffers from recurrent high blood pressure. State security agents brought Agbakoba to his home and his chambers where they searched the premises. From the chambers, the agents removed documents, including files containing information on the trial of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the Nigerian human rights activists who was executed in 1995 despite international protest, and on the Civil Liberties Organisation and the United Action for Democracy. In addition, security agents apparently tampered with the telephone lines. Agbakoba's arrest fits a pattern of harassment of human rights activists aimed at preventing them from exercising their right to free speech guaranteed under international law and the Nigerian constitution. Earlier in the week on May 4, human rights activist Olusegun Maiyegun of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR) was reportedly arrested in Lagos by four plain-clothes security men. In March, police detained Agbakoba and abused him physically, beating him with a rifle butt.

Today in Paris, the donors, joined as the World Bank Consultative Group on Zambia, will discuss Zambia's human rights record. Balance of payments support was suspended by a number of governments in 1996 because of human rights abuses committed by the Zambian government. On May 12-13, the Consultative Group will discuss whether this support should be resumed.  In  Zambia -- No Model for Democracy: Continuing Human Rights Violations, a 57-page report released today, Human Rights Watch documents serious abuses by the Zambian government such as police brutality and torture of detainees.  """"We are very disappointed in what has happened in Zambia since last June's Consultative Group meeting,"""" said Dr. Peter Takirambudde, the executive director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"The government made all the right sounds last year, but since then the police have badly beaten up and even tortured opposition supporters. Former president Kenneth Kaunda and opposition leader Rodger Chongwe were injured in August 1997 when police opened fire with live ammunition to disperse an opposition rally and are lucky to be alive.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the government to undertake an independent public inquiry into the shooting, which the New York-based group has investigated in depth. At an August 23, 1997 rally in Kabwe in central Zambia, ex-president Kaunda and an aide were slightly injured and opposition leader Rodger Chongwe was seriously wounded by shrapnel when a bullet hit their vehicle, according to an independent medical forensic assessment of medical reports commissioned by Human Rights Watch. The expert conclusion, on the basis of the evidence available, was that, as the bullet entered, it sprayed fragments throughout the vehicle. The injuries sustained by the three passengers were consistent with this conclusion.  Photographs of the bullet hole in Kaunda's vehicle, a bullet cartridge found at the scene of the incident, and the bullet reportedly taken from the car were also subjected to ballistic analysis. The finding was that a 762 x 51mm bullet from an assault rifle struck Kaunda's vehicle. The police were carrying weapons with this caliber in Kabwe.  Human Rights Watch has also established that some of the tear gas misused by Zambian police in its operations against the opposition is manufactured by Schermuly Ltd, a British firm.  On October 28 a number of soldiers attempted to stage a coup by seizing the national radio station. A few hours later the government regained control. The following day, a state of emergency was declared and a crackdown on people suspected of being involved in the coup attempt began. A number of opposition politicians were also targeted, including Zambia Democratic Congress (ZDC) leader Dean Mung'omba and ex-president and United National Independence Party (UNIP) leader Kenneth Kaunda, who was detained on December 25. As of May 11, the number of detained was eighty-two.  A number of these detainees were tortured. In early November a number of detainees were reportedly tortured by being put on the kampelwa (or swing). Detainees described the device as a metal rod thrust between two tables, from which they were hung with hands cuffed to the rod and legs bound to it by rope. The police officers reportedly beat them while they hung from the kampelwa. Human Rights Watch received information that at least fourteen of the detainees, including Mung'omba, were tortured or beaten by police while in detention, although the government does not acknowledge this. Human Rights Watch was denied access in late November to the detainees to independently verify the allegations of torture.  The Zambian government has said it wants to hold a 'trial within a trial' for the alleged torturers when the High Court starts its hearing of those supposedly implicated in the October coup. Human Rights Watch condemns such a proposal as insufficient to address these serious allegations of abuse and calls for an independent inquiry.  Takirambudde singled out the Southern African Development Community (SADC) for praise because of its efforts to see an improvement of human rights standards in Zambia. """"SADC and especially the governments of Botswana, Mozambique, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe have played an important role in pushing for rights improvements in Zambia,"""" Takirambudde said.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/05/07/human-rights-indonesia","Human Rights in Indonesia","Human Rights in Indonesia","Statement to the House Committee on International Relations Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights","05/07/1998","Indonesia is facing not just an economic crisis but also a growing human rights crisis. In a statement released today in Bonn, Germany, the International NGO Forum on Indonesian Development (INFID), composed of more than 100 Indonesian and non-Indonesian NGOs, issued a call for """"urgent reform of the Indonesian political system,"""" declaring that """"Indonesia is facing a major turning point in its history."""" It said that without a loosening of political controls, economic recovery was at risk. It pointed out that """"protection of the three basic freedoms of expression, association and assembly is key...For the last thirty years, no political development has taken place. Not only are truly independent political parties banned, but anyone who tries to bring people together for a meeting to work toward democratic goals can face intimidation, harassment, or these days, disappearance.""""   The most tangible symptom, but by no means the only symptom, of the crisis is the series of tense confrontations taking place daily between students and police and military troops on campuses across the country. Before Indonesia's parliament re-appointed President Soeharto to a seventh five-year term in early March, significant protest activity was taking place on about a dozen campuses. Today, the protests are taking place on over 80 campuses, with students from hundreds of institutions joining the protests. On many days, major protests take place on ten or more campuses simultaneously. Students are calling for Soeharto to step down, imposition of more aggressive price controls on basic commodities, and an end to corruption, nepotism and economic collusion. Many of the student groups are also demanding more representative institutions, respect for citizen autonomy, and guarantees for basic rights.   The student protest movement has become a nationwide political force in Indonesia because other political outlets are closed. Even as calls for reform mounted in the run-up to the March parliamentary session, however, the government was stepping-up its use of repressive laws and intimidation of political opponents. By mid-February, efforts to bring together prominent opposition figures in a united front to challenge the leadership fell apart. When the parliament met in early March, electing Soeharto to another 5-year term without a dissenting vote and rejecting all proposals for reform, the center of political activity shifted to the student movement.   To date, the government has used repression, threats and promises of reform in an effort to contain the protests. It has tried to contain the movement by force, banning public marches by students nationwide and stationing hundreds of riot police and troops at campuses across the country. The security presence at campus gates has become a magnet for the protesters' anger and, increasingly, a flashpoint for violence. Far from containing the movement, the government's response appears if anything to have pushed toward increased violence, as witnessed by the sharp increase in both the number of violent confrontations and the level of violence since late April. Some students are now using Molotov bombs as well as stones, and security forces increasingly responding to the protests with rubber bullets, and apparently, at times, live ammunition. There have been at least thirty major clashes between students and security forces since mid-March, and dozens of less serious skirmishes. According to Indonesian news reports, over 800 students and at least 100 security personnel have been injured in the clashes, and at least 100 of the injuries have been treated at hospitals, many with serious facial and head wounds.   The government has also tried to deter the protests through fear. It has threatened to expel students who engage in political activity on campus, has issued ominous warnings that the protests have been infiltrated by communists, and has repeatedly stated that military forces will take """"repressive"""" action against protesters who leave campus grounds. There is also evidence that the forced abduction and subsequent """"disappearance"""" of over a dozen of prominent opposition organizers since early February was the work of military or para-military forces, though some of them have surfaced in recent days. Student leaders have responded by ignoring the warnings, and by suggesting that the abductions are proof either of the government's lack of respect for law or its loss of control of its own personnel.   Earlier this month, the government began to work through the legislature to implement some of the reforms sought by student protesters and opposition leaders, including removal of some of the barriers to political competition that currently constrain Indonesia's two recognized opposition parties. Because President Soeharto has just been re-elected, however, election law reform, even if enacted, will not take effect until elections scheduled for 2002. The government has also indicated that it will consider reform of Indonesia's vaguely worded anti-subversion law, one of several powerful tools the government has used to silence peaceful political dissent. The government has not made a broader commitment to implementing protections for citizens' basic freedoms. It has not suggested that it will replace a spate of other laws, regulations and decrees that severely constrain freedom of expression, association and assembly, and has not offered to release political prisoners currently being held under such laws.   Human Rights Watch/Asia believes that at least some of the recent violence might have been avoided through principled implementation of respect for basic freedoms. Immediate implementation of protections for citizens' basic civil and political rights must be an essential part of efforts to diffuse the crisis without an eruption of even more significant violence. Human Rights Watch fully endorses the call for such protections made today by the International NGO Forum on Indonesian Development (INFID). The statement calls on the international community for """"help in lifting the restrictions that inhibit political development, so that we can work openly, freely, and without fear of repression, to build the political institutions necessary to construct a real democracy.""""   The most pressing need in Indonesia today is implementation of a principled distinction between citizens' exercise of basic rights, which must be protected, and acts of violence, which should be punished to the full extent of the law, in accordance with internationally recognized standards of criminal justice, no matter who is the perpetrator of that violence. Human rights law requires that the government respect students' right to freedom of assembly, including their right to hold public protest marches. The U.S. government, and other key donors, should continue to speak out on behalf of those rights.","Asia, Indonesia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/05/04/statement-during-g8-summit-press-conference","Statement During the G8 Summit Press Conference","Statement During the G8 Summit Press Conference","By Joost Hiltermann Of Human Rights Watch, Washington, DC ","05/04/1998","1. Good morning. My name is Joost Hiltermann, and I am the executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. I am here today because the arms trade is, to a large extent, an issue of human rights concern.   2. Established twenty years ago this year, Human Rights Watch monitors human rights around the world.   3. As part of its mandate, the organization has monitored the production, trade and use of weapons in violation of human rights and international humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war). This found its institutional expression in 1992 in the establishment of the Arms Division, with three goals:  to pursue bans on weapons that are indiscriminate or cruel, like landmines, blinding lasers, and chemical and biological weapons.  to seek to curb arms transfers to forces that abuse human rights, be they governments or non-state actors like paramilitaries and guerrillas.  to promote transparency in arms sales.   4. From this basic position, we strongly support the decision by the G8 to place the issue of illicit arms trafficking on its agenda.   In our field research in Africa and elsewhere, we have discovered that abusive forces are often supplied by private arms traffickers that elude official controls to the extent that such controls exist.   In the case of the Great Lakes region in Africa, for example, which has been the scene of large-scale humanitarian disasters, including genocide, we have documented a steady inflow of weapons through private traffickers who use Europe and South Africa as headquarters and safe havens.   5. The measures that are currently being considered harmonization of export/import documentation, marking of firearms, exchange of information, etc. are all very good, and we support them.   6. Yet it will be important to clarify three points:   As a human rights organization, we cannot afford to place primary emphasis, as the G8 appear to be doing, on the use of firearms in crime. To us and to many NGOs involved with this issue, the primary focus should be on the use of small arms and light weapons generally in armed conflict.   Most serious abuses in post-Cold War conflicts have been committed with precisely these kinds of weapons, which have made conflicts more protracted and lethal, and have emboldened abusive actors and thereby encouraged a climate of impunity.   Unprotested arms supplies to Rwanda in the period leading up to the 1994 genocide, for example, are certain to have provided the perpetrators of the genocide not only with arms but also with a sense of invincibility and impunity.   While it is a good idea to tackle the illicit trade in weapons, we must look at the private arms trade as such, and make sure that arms traders are not receiving licenses for the sale of weapons to known human rights abusers.   Governments have a responsibility to make sure that these kinds of sales are not permitted. It would be all too easy otherwise for governments to covertly supply arms to abusive forces, all the while hiding behind the excuse of a private trade gone wild.   This ties in to my third point: In addition to the private trade, the G8 should also work toward a strict and binding international code of conduct that will prevent the transfer of weapons by states to other states or to non-state actors that are engaged in serious abuses of human rights or international humanitarian law.   As we have seen in cases like Rwanda, serious abuses of human rights, including genocide, are committed not only by non-state actors, but by governments that have been supplied by other governments.   We have documented how various states provided weapons to Rwanda before and even during the genocide.   And in the case of Turkey, which has committed serious abuses of international humanitarian law in its fight with the Kurdish Workers Party in southeastern Turkey and northern Iraq, the United States has provided almost all of the weaponry with which these abuses have been committed.   7. Because it is mainly governments that supply weapons, overly or covertly, to clients that abuse human rights, and it is governments that fail to prohibit private arms sales to such clients, we believe that governments, including the United States, have a moral responsibility to address the problem of illicit arms trafficking in the wider context of the arms trade generally.   So with these three important caveats in mind, Human Rights Watch wholeheartedly endorses the G8's announced intent to tackle the illicit trade in firearms at its summit in Birmingham next week.   Thank you.","","Arms"

Messrs. Gberie and Bangura, who are currently living in Canada, established the fund with the assistance of the Canadian Committee to Protect Journalists (CCPJ). The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) in New York has joined the cause and will help with the distribution of the funds.  The Hellman/Hammett fund of Human Rights Watch has contributed $20,000 US, and the Emergency Fund of European PEN contributed a further $1,000 US. The CPJ, the CCPJ, and the two journalists will arrange for distribution of the funds to more than forty displaced journalists.  On May 25, 1996, a bloody military coup in Sierra Leone terminated the West African nation's first meaningful experiment in pluralistic democracy. The Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC), which overthrew the constitutional government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, embarked upon a campaign of repression against any perceived opponent of the junta, a campaign unprecedented in its viciousness and method. Journalists were a particular target, merely for reporting events. In the first three months of the coup, many of the country's leading journalists and their families were hounded from their homes and forced into hiding, beaten and thrown into prisons without charge. Their offices were ransacked, computers smashed, and many were forced to flee into exile upon their release.  About forty newspapers operated in the country before the coup; fewer than six survived, and they were forced to be compliant and operate in an atmosphere of intimidation made all too real by the frequent arrest and detention of reporters who simply asked """"sensitive"""" questions. At least forty journalists fled the country, most of them living as impoverished refugees in neighboring West African countries.  Journalists are now returning to Sierra Leone, but have little to return to - their publishing materials were confiscated or destroyed during the fighting. And conditions remain extremely dangerous. Edward Smith, a reporter with the British Broadcasting Service, was killed in an ambush by junta forces on 13 April while traveling with West African peacekeeping (ECOMOG) soldiers, and several journalists have been detained, according to CPJ reports. In addition, President Kabbah's government has banned twenty-two newspapers on the grounds that they were not formally registered, according to British freedom of expression group Article 19.  More than thirty-five journalists have been identified as being in need of financial assistance. The Sierra Leone Journalist Assistance Fund is still welcoming contributions.

The organization urged, however, that any court have the power to try all those who committed crimes against humanity during Cambodia's tragedy.  The United States' proposal now before the Security Council limits prosecutions to """"senior members of the Khmer Rouge leadership,"""" who committed crimes during their four-year rule from 1975 to 1979. The proposal notes that some of these people """"may soon become available for prosecution,"""" seemingly referring to those still in the jungle, while potentially excluding those who have abandoned the Khmer Rouge to join the Hun Sen government.  """"It is about time that Pol Pot's henchmen were brought to justice,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"But the court cannot be politically selective. It must be able to try anyone who committed crimes against humanity during that nightmare - whether they are now with the Khmer Rouge or have joined the Cambodian government.""""  Human Rights Watch added that the concept of """"senior leadership"""" should be expanded to include the leading cadre of the Khmer Rouge's central security apparatus, such as those who ran the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, as well as military officers who ordered massacres.  The organization also said the latest proposal only underscored the need to create a permanent criminal court for all those accused of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, rather than rely on a series of selective ad-hoc tribunals.  Human Rights Watch noted that the proposal to create the new tribunal came 19 years after the overthrow of the Khmer Rouge regime, after its leader, Pol Pot, had died, and only six weeks before more than 100 countries are to meet in Rome on June 15 to create a permanent international criminal court. Those negotiations are expected to produce a showdown over the new court's independence. The United States - which has presented the current proposal on Khmer Rouge trials - would allow future prosecutions in most cases only with the approval of the Security Council, where five states have a veto. A coalition of over 50 countries, led by Canada, Germany, Argentina and South Africa, is seeking to free the future court from such a restriction.  """"To deter future atrocities, it is critical to establish a permanent court with an independent prosecutor to try all those accused of genocide, serious war crimes and crimes against humanity -- not just those who have fallen out of favor with the big powers,"""" said Roth.  Human Rights Watch also called for any Khmer Rouge trials to be conducted by a chamber of the existing ad hoc tribunals on the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, which are already functioning with a common Appeals Chamber and prosecutor. The group cautioned against the time-consuming process of selecting a new prosecutor, noting that it took a year to achieve consensus on a prosecutor for the Yugoslavia tribunal.","Asia, Cambodia","International Justice"

The incident, in the southeastern province of Takeo, may have been in part politically motivated, Human Rights Watch charged. In a separate incident on April 26, the Son Sann Party president in Tramkak District of Takeo reported that several shots were fired in front of his house, but no one was wounded. The organization said the April 25 attack, which resulted in two dead and three wounded, was the latest in a series of violent incidents involving political party members running against the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in elections slated for July 1998.  Human Rights Watch called on the Cambodian government to conduct a prompt and thorough investigation of the incident and bring the perpetrators to justice. """"Impunity for perpetrators of this kind of violence may deter Cambodians from taking an active role in opposition parties,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If people are afraid to join the opposition, the credibility of the elections will be jeopardized.""""  According to Human Rights Watch, recent incidents of political violence in Cambodia have included assassinations of senior officials of the Funcinpec Party of Prince Ranariddh _ ousted by Hun Sen in last year's coup _ as well as killings of lower-level opposition party workers and families of members of the armed resistance in the countryside. Human Rights Watch has called on international donors to postpone election aid or technical assistance until minimum conditions for a fair electoral process have been met.  """"Donors should not be supporting a flawed process as the least bad of several unsatisfactory options,"""" said Jones. """"Instead they should be working actively to reduce or eliminate those flaws; in particular by exerting sufficient pressure on the Cambodian government to prosecute clear cases of extrajudicial executions, conducted not only during and immediately after the July 1997 coup, but also these more recent cases as well. Donors should be making an end to this kind of impunity a precondition for any kind of election assistance.""""  In the April 25 incident, a grenade was thrown in front of the house of the sister of Khieu Rama, the district chief for the Son Sann Party in Kirivong District, Takeo Province. Five people were in the house at the time, which is located in Romdel village, Som commune. Two were killed: Khieu Rama's elderly brother Khieu Nuon, aged around 70, and Rama's sister, Khieu Ky, aged around 55. Khieu Rama and two other relatives were seriously injured in the explosion.  While villagers and provincial officials said that the incident may have been prompted in part by a land dispute between commune officials and Rama's sister Khieu Ky, political tensions also existed between the victims' family _ who are involved with the Son Sann Party _ and local authorities, who are members of the CPP.  Two days before the grenade attack, local authorities tried to pressure Khieu Rama to thumbprint a document pledging his support for the CPP, but he refused, according to Son Sann Party officials. Other villagers said that they had been recently pressured to sign up with the CPP or risk the threat of relocation to remote areas such as Pailin in western Cambodia.  In an interview with Human Rights Watch in March, 1998, Khieu Rama expressed his fears about his personal safety during the upcoming electoral campaign. A number of robberies had occurred in Takeo earlier that month, and Khieu Rama feared that he might be targeted for his political views under the guise of a robbery attempt.  Of Cambodia's 24 provinces and municipalities, Takeo will have the fifth largest number of seats in the upcoming National Assembly elections. Kirivong, a fairly remote district in Takeo near the Vietnamese border, was the site of at least three political killings during the 1993 electoral campaign. Two of the victims were members of the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party (BLDP, now called the Son Sann Party) and one was a member of the Liberal Democratic Party. On October 1, 1997, in what is seen as a political killing, five people were summarily executed by a commune militia commander in Kirivong District. Those killed included a popular Funcinpec activist, his son, and three nephews.","Asia, Cambodia",""

According to a  Human Rights Watch report, issued today, the government waged this campaign by cracking down on the region's political parties, arresting and harassing its activists or suspected activists, and censoring from the media most information about Leninabad-based political movements.  Holly Carter, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division commented, """"By excluding the Leninabadi political movement the government of Tajikistan_a country riven with interregional rivalries_ threatens the peace accord it concluded with the United Tajik Opposition."""" The peace agreement, reached in June 1997, ended Tajikistan's five-year civil war.  In pre-civil war Tajikistan the Leninabadi communist nomenklatura directed the nation's politics, helping to foster the interregional rivalries that served as a driving force behind the war. Since the war, however, this region, home to more than 30 percent of the population, has been gradually marginalized from politics. In May 1996 thousands of Leninabadis demonstrated against this state of affairs. The Human Rights Watch report documents the consequences that protest organizers and participants suffered in the year that followed, especially in the wake of an April 1997 assassination attempt against President Emomali Rakhmonov. According to the Human Rights Watch report, those Leninabadis arrested following demonstrations and the assassination attempt were brutally beaten; some were arrested due exclusively to their perceived affiliation with the NRM. Tajik police massacred more than one hundred prisoners in its attempts to put down a prison riot in Khujand (the capital of Leninabad) in April 1997; journalists and newspapers that try to report on Leninabadi political movements and the prison uprising have faced arrests, government threats and other forms of harassment.  The NRM has since 1996 sought a prominent role in the peace negotiations. Following the government's April decision to exclude the NRM, the Commission for National Reconciliation, the transitional body charged with overseeing the implementation of the peace accord, acknowledged that the persecution of political activists _including, presumably, NRM members_ must cease. """"Human Rights Watch welcomes the peace process in Tajikistan and, while not supporting a particular political party or movement, encourages an inclusive as opposed to exclusive, peace process,"""" declared Ms. Cartner.  Among the recommendations in the thirty-two-page report:  Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Tajikistan to facilitate a thorough, independent investigation of the April 1997 Khujand prison massacre, with complete cooperation of prison and medical authorities, and make public the findings of the investigation.  Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Tajikistan to respect its obligations under international law regarding freedom of expression, and cease all forms of intimidation or harassment of the press.  Human Rights Watch urges the United Nations to deploy as quickly as possible human rights experts to Tajikistan and establish a human rights monitoring, reporting and analysis unit.  Human Rights Watch urges the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to open a full-time office in Khujand, actively monitor political and human rights developments in Leninabad oblast, and raise individual cases of human rights violations with their interlocutors in the Tajikistan government.","Europe/Central Asia, Tajikistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/04/28/disappearances-indonesia-military-must-answer","Disappearances In Indonesia- The Military Must Answer","Disappearances In Indonesia: The Military Must Answer","","04/28/1998","Human Rights Watch said today that either senior army and police officials had lied in denying any knowledge of the whereabouts of """"disappeared"""" activists who later turned out to have been in custody, or a secret military or paramilitary unit was operating without the knowledge of top-ranking officers. Either way, the """"disappearances"""" reflected badly on the Indonesian government, the organization said. It called on the government to step up efforts to find and prosecute those responsible both for the disappearances and for the intimidation and harassment of the non-governmental organizations helping the disappeared and their families.  The Human Rights Watch statement came as some of the activists reappeared and began speaking publicly about their experiences in detention. Pius Lustrilanang, a pro-democracy activist who disappeared from February 4 until April 3, revealed earlier this morning that he had been abducted at gunpoint, tortured with electric shocks, beaten, and periodically submerged in water during his two months of captivity. He could not identify his captors, since he was either blindfolded or they were masked. He said a number of other `disappeared' had been detained in the same building, which he believed to be near an airport and not far from the Jakarta-Bogor toll road. The others detained, each of whom was held in a separate cell, included Desmond J. Mahesa and Haryanto Taslam, both of whom resurfaced earlier in the month and are back with their families, and Rahardjo Waluyo Djati and Faisol Reza, who are still missing.  """"It is clear that the abductors of the `disappeared' political activists systematically and repeatedly violated Indonesian law,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"How can the government expect students or anyone else to respect the law or the authority of the state when state security forces themselves engage in such flagrant human rights violations?""""  Both police and military had repeatedly denied any knowledge of the whereabouts of a dozen mostly young activists, even after receiving appeals for information from family members and the National Human Rights Commission. While the armed forces _ which in Indonesia include the police _ are now believed to be holding the rest of the """"disappeared,"""" no one has been able to identify precisely who or what unit is responsible. In the case of Andi Arief, the student leader who reappeared in police custody after more than two weeks in the hands of the men who abducted him, the police must know who turned Andi over to them, but no information has been forthcoming.  On April 21, Andi Arief's parents received a call from national police headquarters in Jakarta that their son, missing since March 28, was being held there. Two days later, they received a formal detention order by post, saying that Andi Arief was being held both as a suspect in a subversion case and as a witness in the subversion case against two students charged with using explosives in connection with a homemade bomb that went off prematurely in an apartment in the Tanah Tinggi area of Jakarta on January 18, 1998. The order was backdated to March 29, but as late as last week, both police and army were denying any knowledge of Andi Arief's arrest. The twenty-eight-year-old head of Indonesia Student Solidarity for Democracy (Solidaritas Mahasiswa Indonesia untuk Demokrasi or SMID) had been abducted from his sister's house in Bandar Lampung by two men in plainclothes on March 28 at 10:30 a.m. The men, who were not in uniform, showed no identification, and produced no warrant, searched the shop, found Andi Arief, and took him away. They were part of a larger group that came to the shop in two Toyota Kijang vehicles. Andi's family reported the abduction to the provincial police command, the city police command, and the regional military command; all said they had no role in the arrest.  The Jakarta daily newspaper Kompas chronicled the military's repeated denial of any knowledge about the disappearances. On March 30, Brig. Gen. Abdul Wahab Mokodongun, the information officer of the Indonesian armed forces, said, """"The armed forces has no connection with the disappearances. Every citizen, whether proven or suspected to have violated the law, will be prosecuted according to the law. There is no kidnapping on our part."""" The next day, he denied again that the armed forces, including the police, were detaining any of the missing. On April 3, he denied that the security forces were behind the disappearances. On April 8, the information officer for the police, Brig, Gen. (Pol) Drs. Sa'i Bachtiar, said the missing were probably in hiding. On April 16, the Jakarta military commander said he had ordered all his troops to help find the missing. Earlier that week, Brig. Gen. Mokodongan had said that instead of implying the military was responsible, the families and friends of the missing should register a formal missing persons report with the police, but he warned, """"It's not the case that after you lose something, you automatically find it, so don't think that if you report something missing, it will automatically turn up."""" On April 22, the commander of the Indonesian police, Maj.Gen. (Pol) Dibyo Widodo, told reporters that the only missing people he knew about were the three who by that date had returned home: Pius Lustrilanang, Desmond J. Mahesa, and Haryanto Taslam. He was therefore publicly denying any knowledge of Andi Arief's whereabouts, when in fact, Andi Arief had been detained for five days in the same complex where Widodo works. On April 26, national police headquarters issued a statement that Andi Arief had been in police custody since March 29.  According to Mohamad Munir, the coordinator of the Jakarta-based Commission on Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence who was able to visit Andi Arief on Thursday, Andi said he was blindfolded by his abductors after being taken from his sister's house on March 28. He was taken to the port of Bakahuni in Lampung where a ferry leaves regularly for West Java. Once on board the ferry, he was allowed to take the blindfold off but he was forced to put it back on after arriving in Merak harbor in Java. He was then driven to a place where he was interrogated non-stop for some twenty-four hours as a radio played constantly. Much of the interrogation focused on the activities of other disappeared activists, some of who appear to have been detained at the same place he was. Andi Arief was kept at the safehouse from March 29 to April 17 when he was transferred to national police headquarters on Jalan Trunjoyo, Kebayoran, South Jakarta. He was moved to the metropolitan Jakarta police command on April 25. He said he was not tortured or physically abused, although he was not allowed to see a lawyer until April 22, in violation of the Indonesian Criminal Procedure Code.  Desmond J. Mahesa, the head of the Jakarta office of the Nusantara Legal Aid Institute, was reported as missing from February 3 to April 3, when he suddenly appeared at his family's house in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan. Last week, he decided to give a public account of what had happened to him. He said that on February 3, he had been at the office of the Indonesian Christian Youth Movement (Gerakan Mahasiswa Kristen Indonesia or GMKI) on Jalan Salemba in Jakarta around 3:10 p.m., when four or five men, all wearing dark glasses, approached him and told him to get in a waiting car. Once in the car, he was blindfolded and driven around for three or four hours, although he said he had a feeling it was all within Jakarta. Eventually, the car stopped at a building, and Desmond was taken to a room where he was told to rest. The blindfold was removed; it was about 7:00 p.m. A little later, one of the men in dark glasses knocked at the door to the room, blindfolded Desmond again, and invited him to eat. Desmond said the building seemed deserted except for the men and himself; he could not tell whether it was a home or an office. After the meal was finished, the men began interrogating Desmond about his activities as a lawyer and his political involvement. He said for the most part, the interrogation was polite, but the interrogators got angry when he said he was not identified with any party (they appear to have been trying to link him to the banned People's Democratic Party or PRD). He was interrogated every night thereafter for one to two hours and had nothing to do during the day except to eat and sleep. Any time he left his room, the blindfold was put back on. At 11:00 a.m. on April 3, he was taken out of the building and told to get in a car. After a short distance, the blindfold was removed, he was given an airplane ticket from Jakarta to Banjarmasin, his home town, and he was dropped off at the airport. The ticket was made out in the name of """"Fahmi.""""  Other activists still missing but also believed to be in military custody include three students from Gajah Mada University in Yogyakarta, Herman Hendrawan, Faisol Reza, and Rahardjo Waluyo Djati, who disappeared after attending a press conference in the offices of the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute in Jakarta. Both Desmond Mahesa and Andi Arief were questioned about the activities of the three during their own interrogations. Hermawan, twenty-eight, is a political science student; Faisol Reza, twenty-five, studies philosophy; and Rahardjo, aged twenty-nine, is a literature student. On April 17, the head of the East Java police, Maj. Gen. (Pol) Mochamad Dayat, was quoted in the newspaper Kompas as saying that Herman had returned but his friends and family have had no word of him.  Suyat, a SMID activist and student from Solo, has been missing since February 12, 1998. According to Suyat's brother, five men who were not in uniform and showed no identification but said in response to a question that they were """"officers"""" (petugas) came to the family's house in Gemolong, Sragen, Central Java at about 2:00 a.m. on February 12, looking for Suyat. The family said he was not at home, but the men entered anyway and began searching the house. When they could not find Suyat, according to an April 16 account in the Surabaya newspaper, Jawa Pos, the men took away his brother, Suyatno. After being interrogated in an unknown place, Suyatno told human rights workers that he was blindfolded and tied up and then brought to the house of one of Suyat's friends in Karanganyar, outside Solo, then to the house of another friend in Kalijambe, Sragen, where Suyat was staying. The five men took Suyat away and dropped off Suyatno on the outskirts of Sumber village. No one has seen or heard from Suyat since.  Petrus Bima Anugerah, known as Bimo, aged twenty-five, is a student at the Driyakara School of Philosophy in Jakarta and a member of the militant political organization, the People's Democratic Party (PRD). He has not been seen or heard from since March 31. His father officially reported him missing to the national police command on April 12. Three other PRD activists initially reported as missing are reported to be detained in the metropolitan Jakarta police command, and Bimo's friends believe he may be in custody as well.  Marah Simon, aged forty-nine, has been missing since early March 1998. The head of the West Sumatra branch of the pro-Megawati Soekarnoputri faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party, Simon left Padang, West Sumatra, for Jakarta on February 25 with five other Megawati supporters. About five days later, the five returned to Padang but Marah Simon told them he was staying behind to attend the wedding of Megawati's daughter onMarch 3. On March 7, his family received a letter from him saying he was fine. The family thought the letter was peculiar and out of character for Marah Simon to send; they have not heard from him since. His fate seems similar to that of Haryanto Taslam, another official of the pro-Megawati faction of PDI, who disappeared in early March and reappeared in East Java on April 17. He is believed to have been in military custody but thus far, he has not been willing to say what happened to him.  The disappearances have caused outrage at home and abroad. The National Human Rights Commission, whose members encouraged Pius Lustrilanang to come forward with his story and offered him protection, has been particularly outspoken. A spokesman in Jakarta on April 23 said the practice of disappearing people was in violation of the law and must be brought to an end, since among other things, it created a culture of fear. Albert Hasibuan, a Comission member, said there was a clear pattern to the recent wave of disappearances, up to and including the practice of blindfolding the victim at the time of capture. He said the Commission would be speaking with officers at national police headquarters to try to determine who was responsible and said those involved could be sued or tried in a special court. The new Minister of Justice, Muladi, has also called on the government to give an official explanation of the disappearances.  In another disturbing development, there have been reported attempts to kidnap individuals working on behalf of the disappeared, including a Roman Catholic priest, Father Sandyawan, and other activists have been threatened. Four people associated with the Indonesian Legal Aid Institute in Jakarta have been terrorized, according to the institute's director, who did not give their names out of concern for their security. Pius Lustrilanang said that during his captivity, he was questioned not only about his activities on behalf of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's first president who has become an opposition leader, but also about the activities of nongovernmental organizations.","Asia, Indonesia",""

According to the Rwandan national radio, the executions will be carried out on April 24 at 10 a.m., in order """"to serve as a lesson"""" to Rwandans. The executions will take place at five places that became infamous for massacres carried out during the 1994 genocide.   Human Rights Watch and FIDH forcefully condemned the genocide and crimes against humanity carried out in 1994. The two international human rights organizations insist on the necessity of trying persons accused of genocide and of severely punishing those found guilty of these crimes. Researchers for Human Rights Watch and FIDH have worked for the last three years to gather and publish evidence that contributes to establishing the truth about the genocide and to help ensure justice for the victims in national courts as well as at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. In 1993, Human Rights Watch and FIDH participated in an international commission of inquiry into human rights abuses in Rwanda and denounced ethnically-based killings already being committed at that time. They warned leaders of the international community to act to prevent the 1994 genocide, but their appeals were unheeded. Human Rights Watch and FIDH oppose the death penalty on principle in all countries and for all crimes. Any criminal system may make errors, leading to miscarriages of justice which are irreparable if a capital sentence is carried out. The likelihood of error is particularly great in the case of Rwanda where the justice system is just beginning to recover from the devastation caused by the genocide. Human Rights Watch and FIDH applaud the efforts of the Rwandan government to bring to justice those accused of genocide, but they deplore the summary nature of some of the trials, which do nothing to reveal the truth about the genocide or to contribute to establishing the rule of law. Some persons have been condemned to death, for example, without having had the opportunity to benefit from legal counsel and others have been condemned after defense witnesses have been so intimidated that they have refused to testify. Carrying out death sentences in such cases ill serves the interests of justice.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"

The appeal came after a Human Rights Watch investigation in the Singrauli region of central India last month found that villagers displaced by a Bank borrower, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), had been beaten and arbitrarily detained for peaceful protests. A meeting of the Bank's board of directors to consider the project is expected to take place in early May.   The appeal came after a Human Rights Watch investigation in the Singrauli region of central India last month found that villagers displaced by a Bank borrower, the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), had been beaten and arbitrarily detained for peaceful protests. A meeting of the Bank's board of directors to consider the project is expected to take place in early May.   In a memo to Bank President James Wolfensohn and the board, the organization urged that all disbursements of current and future loans to NTPC projects in the Singrauli region should be conditioned on respect for fundamental rights. Approximately $252 million of a $400 million loan for the NTPC projects has thus far been disbursed; another $148 million has yet to be paid out.   Human Rights Watch said the underlying cause of the human rights violations has been a failure to resolve displaced villagers' complaints about levels of compensation, conditions of resettlement, and environmental damage. The Bank's central management needed to exercise more direct oversight over projects to ensure that the Bank's own policies on resettlement, environmental protection, and good governance were respected.   Beyond Singrauli, the organization said, the Bank needed to develop a long-term strategy for monitoring the human rights impact of its projects. Such a strategy should include regular, on-site investigations by the Bank's Inspection Panel, a body created as a mechanism for holding the Bank accountable for violations of its policies and procedures. Human Rights Watch urged the Bank to send an Inspection Panel team to the Singrauli area to investigate recent abuses and to formulate measures to prevent further abuses. The Bank should also extend the one year mandate of an ongoing national-level monitoring effort.   Human Rights Watch's recommendations stem from interviews with people displaced by the Bank-funded Vindhyachal Super Thermal Power Project and Rihand Super Thermal Power Project. The team also interviewed activists, who have themselves been subject to threats and harassment; local authorities; and NTPC officials.   The Human Rights Watch report documents recent examples of a broader pattern of abuse by NTPC, police, and civilian authorities. The team found that local authorities together with the NTPC were discouraging displaced villagers from meeting and organizing by using hired """"goon squads"""" to harass and intimidate them. Police used force to disperse larger gatherings and used vaguely worded provisions of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code as a pretext for arresting protestors in the name of """"public tranquility.""""

Recently there has been a strong decline in the numbers of extrajudicial executions and disappearances committed in the course of government counterinsurgency operations in the country. However, torture, both of persons detained on suspicion of terrorist activities and in ordinary criminal cases, remains a basic concern.   Peru's intelligence services, particularly the National Intelligence Service and the Army's Intelligence Service, have been responsible for serious abuses in recent years, including torture, kidnappings and intimidation, arbitrary arrest, wiretapping, and attacks on freedom of expression. For example, in 1996 and 1997, the Frecuencia Latina television channel had denounced government corruption, as well as eavesdropping and human rights violations by military intelligence. The government expropriated the owner of Frecuencia Latina in September 1997. Further, the government has tried to weaken Peru's constitutional mechanisms to protect human rights, including the office of the Attorney General and aspects of the judicial system. The government's failure to make even minimal progress in the rule of the law forced the World Bank in March 1997 to suspend a justice system-related grant to the government.

However, grave human rights problems persist, particularly police violence and abysmal prison conditions. Brazil's police departments are controlled at the state rather than the federal level, and are therefore subject to local pressure to control crime. A good example in this regard is Rio de Janeiro, where current authorities bestow bonuses and promotions on police officers engaged in acts of """"bravery."""" In practice, these prizes are awarded to police who kill criminal suspects regardless of the circumstances. The bravery policy has led to a doubling of the number of civilians killed by police, now estimated at more than thirty civilians per month. As a basis of comparison, the police in New York, a city 35 percent larger than Rio, kill fewer than thirty civilians per year. Throughout Brazil, people awaiting trial and those already convicted are held together in police lock-ups in inhuman conditions, for months and often years. As many as forty to fifty people are often held for months in small, rancid cells that are designed for short-term detention for six to eight prisoners.

On March 2 - March 7, 1998, we sent a team consisting of a U.S. and an Indian national to the Singrauli region to investigate some of those reports; our findings and recommendations are summarized below.  The police, members of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), civilian authorities, and officials of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), often acting in concert, have engaged in a pattern of clear human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, degrading treatment in custody, and indiscriminate use of force, against persons displaced by the Bank-funded Vindhyachal Super Thermal Power Project (VSTPP) and Rihand Super Thermal Power Project (RhSTPP) and against those who have protested compensation levels, conditions of resettlement, and environmental damage. We urge that all disbursements of current loans and all future loans to the NTPC be conditioned on respect for fundamental rights of those affected by the project, including the right to peacefully and freely express their views without unreasonable or illegal restrictions or abuse by local authorities and the right to be fully consulted with respect to appropriate compensation and resettlement in accordance with the Bank's own resettlement and environmental policies and its emphasis on good governance.  The Bank needs to develop a long-term strategy for more effective, ongoing monitoring as a way to establish a means to address abuses. As one component of that strategy, we urge that the one-year term of the Independent Monitoring Panel (IMP) be extended and that the model of a national-level monitoring board be applied to other countries in which the Bank works. We also urge that the IMP be permitted to report its findings directly to the Inspection Panel and the Bank's Executive Directors. The presence of the IMP should not, however, undermine the equally important role of the Inspection Panel, without whose report the IMP might not have been established.     The Xavier Institute of Development Action and Studies (XIDAS) has also played a critical role in bringing to light the problems associated with the Singrauli project. Its report will form the basis of the IMP's efforts to resolve conflicts between those affected by the project and the NTPC. We urge that the full XIDAS report be sent directly to the Executive Directors, that its recommendations concerning the participation of project-affected people be implemented without delay, and that XIDAS continue to be involved in the project until all of the issues concerning resettlement and compensation have been resolved. Without such direct involvement, the human rights abuses we document in this report may continue.     Neither the IMP nor XIDAS, however, should be seen as a substitute for direct Bank supervision of the project, which to date has been lacking. The Bank's Executive Directors should ensure that Bank management staff exercise oversight of the project, including on-site visits, and that the Bank implement the recommendations of the IMP and XIDAS.  The Inspection Panel (IP) should be called to review progress with regard to the recommendations of the IMP and the XIDAS within one year and report directly to the Executive Directors of the Bank. The Inspection Panel has played and continues to play an important role in exposing some of the problems of compensation and resettlement that lie at the root of the human rights violations we documented. Following a visit in July 1997, the Inspection Panel had requested that it be permitted to conduct a more thorough on-site investigation. Had it been able to do so, some of the subsequent problems might have been averted. The Bank should now deploy an Inspection Panel team to the Singrauli area to conduct an on-site investigation and to formulate measures to prevent further human rights abuses. Continued involvement of the Inspection Panel is critical to ensuring that a fair resolution of the problems affecting the displaced communities in the Singrauli project area is achieved.     Given the vital role the Inspection Panel has played with regard to the Singrauli project, we urge that the Bank, in its review of the Inspection Panel, ensure that its powers are not diluted and that it be permitted to continue to perform its function as an independent body to investigate complaints and monitor Bank projects in all countries.     The Singrauli case has raised many critically important and interlinked issues of human rights, resettlement, compensation, and environmental protection. In accordance with its 1993 policy of transparency and disclosure, the Bank should make public as much of the internal debate and discussion on the case as possible, including the results of missions and site visits and the reports of the IMP and XIDAS. We further urge that the Bank's Executive Directors meet to discuss the Singrauli project as soon as possible.  Human Rights Abuses Against Project-Affected Persons   Men and women in the Singrauli have been subject to human rights abuses perpetrated by various state actors including police, members of the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), civilian authorities, and contractors or individuals acting on behalf of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), a government body. In some cases these abuses, which were still taking place in early 1998, have been carried out by local police or other security forces at the request or in the presence of NTPC. As has been well-documented by Indian and international non-governmental organizations, the basis for most of these abuses has been either complaints about levels of compensation given to villagers who were forced to relocate or opposition to relocation itself. Many of those we interviewed felt they had not been adequately consulted about problems related to displacement or environmental destruction, contrary to current Bank policies.   Our interviews echoed the findings of the Bank's Inspection Panel, which noted in its December 22, 1997 report on the NTPC project that it had found """"serious violation of Bank polices on Environmental Assessment (Operational Directive 4.01) and Involuntary Resettlement (Operational Directive 4.30).""""   Operational Directive 4.30 states that """"arrangements for monitoring implementation of resettlement and evaluating its impact should be developed by the borrower during project preparation and used during supervision. Monitoring provides both a warning system for project managers and a channel for the resettlers to make their needs known and their reactions to resettlement execution."""" Despite these provisions, many project-affected persons told us that they had not been adequately consulted about resettlement arrangements or the environmental impact of the project. Others noted that because of the lack of consultation, alternative ash waste disposal arrangements that would have been less destructive to the environment were not explored. Many displaced persons stated that they felt obliged to protest the destruction of the local environment, as their fields and surrounding areas represented their only sources of livelihood. A lack of real community participation in critical decision-making processes appears to be a root cause of many of the problems related to the project.   Many of the displaced we interviewed described a cycle that would begin with physical abuse and harassment, and lead to arbitrary arrest and detention, ill-treatment and threats in custody, arbitrary application of the law, and intimidation to discourage further protest. They described a pattern of NTPC personnel engaging third parties to carry out acts of violence. Displaced persons demonstrating in front of the Rihand power plant gates reported that private """"goon squads"""" had been used to intimidate and physically harass them.   Freedom of Assembly/Freedom of Association/Arbitrary Arrest   The displaced are discouraged from assembling in public and creating organizations through the use of intimidation, force, and the application of Section 144 of India's Criminal Procedure Code, a broadly worded, all-purpose clause that can be used to restrict freedom of assembly. Section 144 allows a district magistrate or sub-divisional magistrate to direct any person or group to stop any activity in order to """"prevent injury to any person... or danger to human life, health, or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquility."""" It is supposed to be used only in cases where urgent prevention or remedy is required and where there is an immediate perceived danger to public order. In the Singrauli area, it has become the instrument of choice in preventing organized protests, and we were told that authorities sometimes used it to prohibit gatherings of more than four people.   At the same time, local authorities generally did allow protests at specific dharma or sit-in sites, one in front of the Rihand and one in front of the Vindhyachal power plant colonies. Sit-ins at these sites have taken place intermittently over the past several years, and during our investigation in March 1998, displaced persons conducted small sit-ins in both places involving between two and twenty participants, apparently without incident.   On several occasions in recent months, however, police used force when the sit-ins became larger. In one case, two NGOs in the Singrauli area, Visthapith Samaj Seva Sang (VSSS) of Navjeevan Vihar and Grameen Kalyan Sangharsh Samiti (GKSS) of Bijpur, had planned a demonstration on December 16, 1997 in front of the Vindhyachal power plant colony, advocating for more compensation for those displaced by the projects.   According to witnesses at the demonstration site, approximately fifty people had gathered in a peaceful manner in the late morning on the December 16. Within minutes, police from the Navjeevan Vihar station began dispersing the protesters, beating them with batons and shouting insults. Five people were arrested by members of the Navjeevan Vihar police in front of the power plant. An elderly man arrived on the scene after police had attacked the demonstrators and attempted to help one participant who had been beaten. He told us,   When I arrived, I saw Sumant Sharma lying by the road with his clothes torn. When I walked toward him, the police raised their sticks and insulted me. They threatened to break my hands and my head. They said we've already arrested four or five -- we'll arrest you too.   In reference to the incident, the Station House Officer of the Navjeevan Vihar police told us in an interview on March 6 that the police had received complaints that demonstrators were insisting that people join their protest. He said the police had calmly asked the demonstrators to refrain from illegally detaining pedestrians. He also stated that four or five of the demonstrators were arrested. He also mentioned that the police had not filed cases against many of the displaced who were illegally farming their fields, now NTPC land. He even claimed that the police had been conservative in making charges against displaced persons in an effort to avoid bogging down the legal system.   The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in New Delhi also conducted an investigation, but failed to take seriously the charges of police abuse. One official claimed that the NHRC was """"satisfied that no act took place which calls for an action on the part of the Commission"""" and that they were """"assured that nothing illegal has happened... and that there was no high-handedness by police as alleged."""" Upon further questioning, however, the same official admitted that he had not spoken to any of those arrested or involved in the demonstration and that he had only spoken with the police.   Further arrests occurred on December 18, 1997 near this demonstration site in fields that had been legally transferred to NTPC but were still in use by some of the displaced. According to one of the individuals arrested, NTPC personnel and contractors accompanied by police, members of the CISF, and private security guards of NTPC, arrived at the fields that morning with heavy machinery to destroy the fields. After hours of discussion between NTPC Resettlement and Rehabilitation personnel, the Additional Superintendent of Police, civilian authorities, and a group of displaced who were protesting the destruction, several of the protesters placed themselves in front of the machinery. Police responded by beating them with sticks and arresting seven. We interviewed one of the victims who claimed he had been beaten on his back and his hands; some ten weeks later, the marks of the beating were still visible.   When asked about these incidents, the NTPC General Manager of the Vindhyachal power plant described the problem as """"not a question of resistance, but people trying to take as much as possible."""" He said that police had to come to the scene to remove protesters who were """"in the way of construction."""" He also stated that NTPC had since left the fields and told local villagers to """"please come cultivate.""""   Displaced persons also told us that abuses were frequently carried out by private security forces or """"goon squads"""" employed by contractors working with NTPC or by NTPC itself. One such incident reportedly occurred on January 5, 1998 in the village of Mitihini. On that day, individuals attempted to resist ash dike construction on fields near the village, being carried out by KN Construction Company (KNCC) on behalf of NTPC. KNCC is a regular and major contractee of NTPC. According to one of the protesters, in order to proceed with their work, KNCC used over thirty """"goons"""" to physically abuse the men and women from Mitihini who were on the scene. The same day, the Rihand power plant colony gate at Bijpur was closed to discourage other people from joining the protest.   On February 9, 1998, two men, Harish Chandranai and Bhagwati, were arrested in front of the Vindhyachal power plant by police, reportedly acting under orders from the Upper Collector, a local official. They were among a group of people that had set up market stalls on land immediately adjacent to a state road near the Vindhyachal colony wall; such land, according to the people we interviewed, is public land. The stall owners told us that they been displaced from their farms and the lack of other livelihood options had obliged them to set up the stalls.   Knowledgeable sources claim that NTPC officials had requested in writing to the Upper Collector that the market stalls be destroyed, possibly due to their location just adjacent to the power plant entry way. According to Bhagwati and other witnesses, the General Manager of the Vindhyachal power plant, his deputy, the local Upper Collector, and the Sub-district Magistrate had all visited the market stall site at various times on February 9. The same day, NTPC security guards and police attempted to dismantle the stalls. When people from the market stalls protested, the Upper Collector told police on the scene to arrest all those involved. Several, including Harish Chandranai and Bhagwati, were also beaten. According to R.S. Verma, who witnessed the incident, two female market stall operators were struck by NTPC security guards, had their clothes torn, and were pushed into an open sewer.   The security guards and police eventually left the scene without destroying the market stalls. On the afternoon of March 2, 1998, however, a flaming object was reportedly thrown from inside the NTPC colony onto the market stalls. Several of the stalls were seriously damaged by the subsequent fire. Human Rights Watch visited the site where signs of the fire were clearly visible.   Representatives of the NGO, Visthapith Samaj Seva Sang (VSSS) filed a First Information Report (FIR)-- the starting point for any investigation -- with police about the February 9 arrests of Bhagwati and Chandranai and the ill-treatment of the market stall owners described above. No investigation was pursued, and according to those we interviewed, this was the standard state response to complaints. Displaced persons claimed that police frequently failed to formally register their complaints. On December 17, 1998, following the arrests and ill-treatment of five displaced persons on the previous day, members of VSSS addressed a letter of protest to the local Upper Collector. As of March 6, 1998, they had received no response.   Arbitrary Detention/Ill-Treatment and Degrading Treatment in Custody   People from villages detained by police or serving jail time in the Singrauli area were subject to poor conditions and degrading treatment. In addition to physical abuse, displaced persons consistently spoke of threats and insults against them related to their demands for resettlement compensation.   Displaced persons detained on December 16 and 18, 1997 stated that they were held at the Navjeevan Vihar police station without food, water, or access to a toilet for twenty-four hours. They claimed that police harassed them while in custody, pulling their hair, insulting them, and threatening them saying, """"We will ruin your life, we will let you rot in jail."""" At the station the detainees were not allowed to speak, did not have access to a lawyer, and were not told what charges had been filed against them.   A total of fourteen persons arrested on December 16 and 18 were transferred to the Sidhi district jail where they were subject to further degrading treatment and harsh conditions. Displaced persons detained at Sidhi jail stated that they """"had to fight for each drop of water"""" for drinking and bathing, and were required to perform degrading tasks such as cleaning latrines by hand.   The former detainees told us that while they were in Sidhi jail some of their families received visits from Navjeevan Vihar police who threatened to send the detainees out of the district if their protest activities did not stop. Sending them out of the district would severely limit their access to their families and perhaps further delay court hearings. According to the displaced, bail was set only after court officials had been bribed; for one of the detainees this was after fifteen days in custody. The displaced claimed, contrary to common practice, that local magistrates were either absent or unwilling to set bail for them on December 19, increasing the length of their detention. The detainees were released from jail between ten and nineteen days later.   The people we interviewed stated that the length of detention for protesters was often arbitrarily prolonged due to special instructions from the police, local magistrates, or NTPC officials. In a June 27, 1996 police report from Bijpur, a copy of which we saw, the Station House Officer attempted to maximize the length of detention of a group of twenty-three displaced persons arrested in Mitihini. The twenty-three had been arrested for passively obstructing construction on their fields. Following their arrest, the Station House Officer in Bijpur issued a written report to the Sub-divisional Magistrate saying, """"It is requested to Mr. Manu that Ram Narayan and others be put in jail for as long a time as possible."""" (Narayan was among the protesters.) This request was made despite the peaceful nature of the resistance. Fourteen of the detainees were transferred to Jabalpur jail where they were held for approximately two weeks. During this time, police officers visited the homes of two of the men arrested and attempted to intimidate their family members.   Court officials at times appeared to take harsh action against protesters. Following the arrest of twenty-three protesters in Mitihini village in 1996, a range of charges were filed. Approximately nine months later, the High Court of Allahabad found that the charges were without basis and dismissed them. The same day, a Sub-district Magistrate in Khaad told a resident of Mitihini village, """"You're not going to get land or jobs. If you make trouble, we'll drop ten charges on you."""" Later the same day, local judicial authorities invoked Section 144 in the Bijpur and Mitihini area, prohibiting public assembly for the next fifteen days.   Hearings of cases against displaced often drag on over several months and involve costs that are crippling for displaced persons. Individuals with court cases stated that they were required to appear for hearings two to three times a month, at a cost of approximately 120 rupees (a little over U.S.$3.00) per person for court and clerk fees; some cases had dragged on for at least nine months. Missing a court hearing could result in arrest. Bail and miscellaneous fees often amounted to thousands of rupees, and displaced persons frequently complained of having to bribe court officials in order to move their cases forward. Due to their economic status, project-affected persons were also often required to use their land as collateral for bail. Several displaced persons who had false or inflated charges pending against them stated that the compensation they had received for relocation had been used to pay lawyers, court fees, bribes, and miscellaneous expenses incurred in order to defend themselves.   Freedom of Expression/Arbitrary Arrest   People in resettlement colonies and in villages both stated that they were subject to threats whenever they raised their voices, especially when speaking out against conditions regarding resettlement or compensation. One resident of Navjeevan Nagar resettlement colony stated, """"Whenever we show them our bellies, they show us their sticks,"""" in a reference to the reaction of security forces who accompanied NTPC personnel on visits to the resettlement colony.   Individuals arrested on December 16 and 18, 1997 claimed that they were not permitted to speak while in the custody of the Vindhyachal police, nor were they allowed to communicate with a lawyer.   Protesters are frequently charged with violations of the Criminal Procedure Code, apparently in an effort to restrict freedom of expression. We have documented such misuse of criminal procedures in other areas of India where members of civil society or political parties have attempted to exercise their rights to assemble, organize, or express themselves. Individuals with several cases pending against them find themselves entangled in costly and time-consuming processes of an over-burdened and highly bureaucratic legal system.   Raj Dev, one of the five individuals arrested on December 16, 1997 in Vindhyachal, was charged with five sections of the Criminal Procedure Code, including Sections 107, 109, 110, 116, and 151. Section 110, also known as the Goondas (goons) Act, targets """"habitual offenders and desperate characters"""" or those who are """"so desperate and dangerous as to render [their] being at large without security hazardous to the community."""" A resident of Uska village, told us, """"They put five cases on me; it's like putting a gag on our mouth so we can't talk any more.""""   Several other leaders of the displaced were also charged with the Goondas Act and voiced similar complaints. Suryalal Sahu, approximately sixty-five years old, was among those arrested and beaten on December 18, 1997. Sahu stated that he had been charged with the Goondas Act, as well as Sections 147, 148, 194, 336, and 506B. Section 506 targets individuals who may be implicated in """"criminal intimidation"""" or who threaten others with """"death or grievous hurt."""" During interviews, NTPC and police officials informally referred to some of the protesters as goondas.   Gender-specific Issues   In addition to the violations of physical integrity noted above, Human Rights Watch is particularly troubled by the use of violence against women, including by female constables. As with police confrontations with male protesters, female police often used verbal abuse, beatings, or other brutal methods against women who passively resisted relocation from villages or obstructed NTPC destruction of fields.   Leelavati, a seventy-year-old woman who lives in Uska village near the Vindhyachal power plant, told Human Rights Watch of her experience with female police. Leelavati, who is in a precarious state of health, had refused to leave her home, claiming that she had not received any compensation for her house. In July 1997, police arrived at her home, accompanying NTPC personnel and laborers who had instructions to dismantle her house. When she refused to leave, two female police officers dragged her by her arm out of her house and said, """"We'll give you a good beating if you don't stay outside."""" Laborers proceeded to dismantle her house, the remains of which were still visible during our site visit. She had moved in with neighbors who were also refusing to relocate, claiming the compensation they had received would not permit them to survive in the resettlement colony.   Residents in Mitihini village stated that nine women were detained by police on June 27, 1996. The women were part of a larger group of Mitihini residents who were blocking the work of a bulldozer sent to destroy fields. One of the nine, a woman holding a small child, was physically abused by three female officers and detained. Her child was reportedly taken from her arms by female police and thrown several feet away, suffering injuries. The nine women were held in the police station without food until late into the evening of June 27. One pregnant detainee fainted while in police custody.   Displaced women we met also drew attention to discrimination in the compensation system. Women were rarely offered jobs or monetary compensation despite the crucial role they have traditionally played in farming and supporting their families. Many women interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Navjeevan Nagar faced particular hardship following relocation as they apparently had even less access then displaced men to sustainable jobs or land as compensation. Our research also found caste-related discrimination. Displaced people from the lower Basohars caste in Navjeevan Nagar claimed that steady jobs with NTPC had been given exclusively to their former upper caste neighbors who now lived within the NTPC power plant colony.   Freedom of Movement   The only restriction on freedom of movement we noted was within the Rihand colony. The road leading through the Rihand colony constitutes the shortest route between much of the commercial section of Bijpur and the village of Mitihini. At Rihand, the gates close at approximately 11:00 p.m., after which access is subject to the discretion of CISF. People who wished night access to the hospital located inside the gates had to convince the CISF that they had good reasons for wanting access. CISF also frequently closed the gates to the colony during protests, thereby preventing access to the NTPC administration in Rihand.   Foreign nationals face further restrictions on access either to or through the Rihand power plant colony or to adjacent areas where villages are being destroyed for ash dike construction. On March 5, 1998, our team was denied access to the Rihand colony by CISF at the Bijpur gate as we were trying to get to Mitihini village. The officials who denied us access told us there was no other way to get there. Despite repeated efforts to call from the CISF office telephone at the colony gate, we never got through to the management of the Rihand colony. As we waited for more than two hours in the CISF office, CISF officers told us that Rihand management had been informed that we were coming and did not wish to speak with us.   Responses from the Indian Government   Despite the serious nature of the above abuses and a high level of tension among both displaced persons and authorities in the Singrauli area, most government officials we met downplayed problems related to resettlement. Officials from the police, NTPC, and NHRC interviewed by Human Rights Watch generally denied that serious human rights abuses had been committed against displaced persons. Officials frequently described the resistance to relocation as the efforts of a few individuals who were either not from the area or who were trying to exploit the situation.   The general manager of NTPC in Vindhyachal power plant, claimed that there were no serious problems in the area and that the Navjeevan Nagar resettlement colony was """"one of the finest in India."""" When asked whether NTPC had a formal system to receive grievances from displaced persons, the general manager explained to us in a March 6, 1998 interview in Vindhyachal colony,   The Court has given directions. The state government has given everything -- every one has got it. If anyone has a complaint or needs something, I will ensure he gets it. Let them come to me and tell me. Why don't they come to me and tell me? I have received them numerous times right here in my office.   From our research, however, it appeared that there were no formal grievance procedures in place and that displaced persons experienced great difficulty in approaching the Vindhyachal power plant general manager with their complaints.   Members of the National Human Rights Commission have also downplayed the importance of events in the Singrauli area. In response to complaints from displaced persons in 1996, the NHRC conducted an investigation in Singrauli but found the complaints to be baseless. Their investigation was criticized by many villagers who claimed they had not sufficiently consulted the affected populations and had spent too much time in the Singrauli area with NTPC officials.   In February 1998, NHRC officials reported to Human Rights Watch that they had investigated the incidents of December 16 and 18 as well as January 15-16, 1998 and had found them also to be without foundation. In March 1998, however, an NHRC official admitted that this investigation had not included interviews with any of the affected villagers, as stated above. Nonetheless, three NHRC officials we spoke with, who had been involved in the Singrauli case, remained defensive of NTPC's role in resettlement and rehabilitation.   NTPC officials appeared to exercise significant influence over the actions of local police and civilian authorities, including local magistrates and police. Many displaced persons alleged that NTPC would manipulate these authorities in order to silence protesters rather than addressing root causes of their grievances. On January 15, 1998, residents of Mitihini village complained to Bijpur police that NTPC workers were attempting to bulldoze crops in Mitihini. The Bijpur Station House Officer reportedly reprimanded NTPC officials during a phone call in the presence of Mitihini residents and ordered the plowing to stop. Despite this order, the fields in question were destroyed early on the morning of January 16 by NTPC workers. An NTPC manager on the scene stated the following to residents of Mitihini:   Why are you running around saying that we're plowing crops? If you give our names, we'll beat you. Madhu Kohli and Sumant Sharma [activists involved in organizing protests among the displaced] are the ones that cut your crops and got you sent to Jabalpur.   Villagers told us that this type of response from NTPC was typical.   In reporting these responses of villagers, we want to stress that we understand the crucial role NTPC plays in the lives of people, not only in the Singrauli area but throughout India. To its credit, NTPC has taken over many functions usually reserved to local government agencies in this rural and impoverished region. In providing some infrastructure and certain services, such as road maintenance, it has improved the quality of life for many Singrauli residents.   The division of labor between NTPC and other government institutions in Singrauli, however, has caused some confusion. Many displaced claimed that they have """"fallen between the cracks"""" as NTPC and other government institutions each claim that the other is responsible for providing particular services, maintenance, or infrastructure to the resettlement colonies. These lines of responsibility should be clarified in a manner that assures the provision of basic services to local residents and the displaced.   NTPC also appears to exercise important influence over crucial government agencies in the Singrauli area such as the police and the judiciary. These agencies play critical roles in the protection of human rights of the displaced. The important relationship between NTPC and government institutions, as well as the de facto replacement of the state by NTPC in many areas of administration, should be considered when developing strategies and recommendations to promote human rights of the displaced in Singrauli and elsewhere in India.   Recommendations   As the key financial backer of NTPC, the World Bank should work closely with the Indian government and NTPC to assure that past abuses against displaced persons are addressed and that the likelihood of future violations is minimized.   Many of the violations of civil and political rights noted by Human Rights Watch appear to have emerged due to conflict between the displaced and NTPC over resettlement related to Bank-financed projects. Any measures that can be taken to rebuild confidence and trust between displaced persons, NTPC, local authorities, and the World Bank itself and defuse rising tension in the Singrauli area would clearly be highly desirable.   In this regard, we want to again underscore the importance of the Independent Monitoring Panel which has already conducted at least three on-site investigations since January 1998. From our interviews with two members of the three-member panel, we understood that the mandate of the IMP involved looking at some of the incidents described in this memo as well as monitoring implementation of resettlement measures. We also want to stress the importance of the study undertaken by XIDAS, which has conducted a detailed technical assessment of the impact of the project, the adequacy of resettlement measures and the validity of the complaints made by local residents. We urge the Bank to give the recommendations of the IMP and XIDAS the highest priority.","Asia, India","Economic Justice and Rights, World Bank, IMF"

The Department of Defense distributed the memorandum to military attaches based at embassies in Washington, and to NATO partners in Brussels. Some of these officers represent militaries with extremly poor human rights records.     U.S. officials have stated that American peacekeepers could be become the target of frivolous or politically-motivated cases before the ICC. In trying to enlist the support of armed forces from countries with a history of human rights abuse, however, the Pentagon is encouraging military officers who might have reason to fear ICC prosecution to take an active role in weakening the court before it is created.     After outlining the Pentagon's reservations about the ICC, the document concludes: """"We ask you to support these critical positions. MOD engagement is particularly important because military personnel would be significantly affected by an ICC."""" MOD evidently refers to Ministry of Defense.     In an April 10 letter to Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Human Rights Watch expressed its """"profound concern"""" that the United States is """"appealing to the worst instincts of some of the worst abusers of human rights."""" A copy of the letter is attached.     """"They're calling in the foxes to help build the chicken coop,"""" said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Pentagon should not resort to enlisting the Pinochets of the world to lobby against the creation of an independent and effective ICC.""""     After three years of preliminary drafting, the statute to establish a permanent International Criminal Court will be negotiated at a diplomatic conference scheduled for June 15 - July 17, 1998 in Rome. The proposed Court will prosecute those accused in future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes when domestic courts have failed to investigate or prosecute these crimes. More than fifty governments, and hundreds of non-governmental organizations, view the establishment of the ICC as a historic opportunity to enforce international humanitarian law and deter future atrocities.     Concerned that the Court might prosecute American military personnel, the United States has been pressing for broad restrictions on the powers of the ICC and its prosecutor. Human Rights Watch believes that the these restrictions are unnecessary. The ICC will only have jurisdiction when domestic courts have been unable or unwilling to prosecute the crimes of genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity. An effective prosecution by a U.S. federal court or court martial would bar the ICC from taking any further action.","United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

The establishment of an effective and independent International Criminal Court will qualitatively strengthen international human rights and humanitarian law. An ICC with sufficienct authority will help to limit the sense of impunity that frequently fuels genocide, crimes against humanity and serious violations of the laws and customs of war. We believe that an effective ICC will be a deterrent to the commission of such crimes in the twenty-first century. This view is shared by more than fifty governments from around the world that have partictipated in the negotiations for the founding conference in Rome this June and July. President Clinton also expressed his strong support of an International Criminal Court during his recent visit to Rwanda.  At the same time, we are aware that United States defense officials have held meetings in Washington with military attaches from foreign embassies to discuss the ICC. We understand that similar discussions have taken place in Europe. We are deeply concerned that the U.S., fearing that its peacekeepers could one day be targets of frivolous or politically motivated ICC actions, is appealing to the worst instincts of some of the worst abusers of human rights. These military-to-military discussions, which we understand to include a broad range of militaries, may motivate potentially appropriate defendants of an ICC to try to weaken the very court being created to hold them to account.  We agree with the Department of Defense that the Court should not be misused as a vehicle to advance a political agenda against U.S. military personnel. However, we believe that the Draft Statute contains sufficient safeguards to filter out frivolous or otherwise inapprorpiate cases. To appeal to a broad range of militaries, some of whom have engaged in criminal acts themselves, to """"take an active interest in the negotiations regarding an international criminal court,"""" as the document being circulated by the Defense Department does, threatens to impede an effective international tribunal by encouraging inappropriate constraints on its action.

At the same time, it urged the Malaysian government to halt plans for deportation and allow the men immediate access to officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) so that they can be interviewed in confidence to determine whether they have a valid claim to asylum. Eight Acehnese remain at the U.S. embassy compound. All are asylum-seekers from the special region of Aceh, on the northern tip of Sumatra in Indonesia, where an armed separatist movement called Aceh Merdeka (Free Aceh) has been sporadically active since 1976. The men escaped on March 26 from an immigration detention camp not far from Kuala Lumpur.  """"If these men get sent back to Indonesia, where there is a well-established pattern of arbitrarily detaining and ill-treating persons suspected of supporting Aceh Merdeka, they are likely to face serious human rights violations,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"If they are deported before being interviewed by UNHCR, the Malaysian government could be responsible for violating the principle of non-refoulement _ not sending refugees back to a country where they may face persecution _ and the French, Swiss, and Bruneian governments would be complicit.""""  On March 26, more than 500 Acehnese were deported from Malaysia despite violent protests by the deportees, resulting in the deaths of eight detainees and one policeman in one immigration detention center alone. The April 2, 1998 edition of Waspada, a Medan (North Sumatra) newspaper, quoted the governor of Aceh as saying the 545 Acehnese deportees were undergoing a two-week """"guidance"""" program before they were sent back to their homes. He said the """"guidance"""" was necessary because these people had been living abroad so long they needed to understand how much progress Indonesia had made. All were deported to a military camp that used to be run by Kopassus, the army special forces, in Rancong, outside Lhokseumawe.  Hundreds of Acehnese are believed to be detained without charge or trial in military camps in Aceh, but no outside agency has been allowed regular access to these camps. In March 1997, the Indonesian government suspended visits to prisons in Aceh by the International Committee of the Red Cross.  Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned that the actions of the Swiss and French governments, both parties to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, amount to a violation of their obligations under this treaty.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Indonesia, France","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Asylum Seekers"

Shubeilat's trial in the state security court for inciting an illegal demonstration in Ma'an is scheduled to resume on April 13, 1998. The letters say that the press ban violates internationally recognized standards for freedom of expression and constitutes outright censorship of the press.  """"Banning coverage of such a high-profile case, and prohibiting journalists from reporting news from the courtroom, send an ominous message,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East division of Human Rights Watch. """"It can only be viewed as blatant state interference with the fundamental right of a free press to report the news, and the right of the public to obtain the news. The fact that this ban comes in the context of a continuing clamp down on the press in Jordan makes it only more worrying.""""  CPJ chairman Gene Roberts said: """"The media blackout follows a disturbing pattern of government efforts to silence the press in Jordan. We urge the Jordanian government to end censorship and the criminal prosecution of journalists, which violate international press freedom standards.""""  CPJ and Human Rights Watch have previously communicated to Jordanian authorities their concern about unwarranted restrictions on freedom of expression, including those codified in the 1993 press and publications law as well as the 1997 press law amendments, which the High Court of Justice ruled unconstitutional in January 1998. Human Rights Watch has called for repeal of Article 195 of the penal code, which criminalizes expression deemed insulting to His Majesty King Hussein, and CPJ has urged a cessation of the prosecution of journalists under this statute. These issues have been raised by CPJ most recently in Attacks on the Press in 1997, the organization's annual survey on press freedom conditions worldwide that was published in March 1998, and in two Human Rights Watch reports published in June 1997 ( """"A Death Knell for Free Expression?

A letter from Human Rights Watch to the Prime Minister and other Jordanian Government Officials (April 9, 1998) In its letter, Human Rights Watch also criticizes the categorical ban on all public demonstrations that went into effect in Jordan on February 10, at a time when many Jordanians were deeply concerned about the prospect of a U.S.-led military strike on Iraq. It says that a ban on peaceful demonstrations cannot be justified if its intent is to silence opposition voices and suppress freedom of expression. It also expresses deep concern that Leith Shubeilat is being prosecuted in the state security court because he exercised his right to freedom of expression, and urged others to express their views in a public manner.""""No one should be subjected to criminal prosecution for expressing opinions privately or publicly that are critical of the state's domestic or foreign policies,"""" said Hanny Megally.

Mr. Shubeilat, whose trial began last month, has been charged with inciting an illegal demonstration. He was arrested on the night of February 19-20 as he was returning to Amman after speaking that evening at a mosque in Ma'an, in southern Jordan. According to the prosecutor's charge sheet, Mr. Shubeilat was highly critical of the government and urged the audience in Ma'an to demonstrate publicly to express support for Iraq. Pro-Iraq demonstrations erupted in Ma'an after Friday noon prayers on February 20. Demonstrators clashed with security forces, who intervened to enforce the ban on demonstrations. One resident of Ma'an was shot and killed in disputed circumstances, which prompted additional unrest and clashes between residents and riot police. Army units were dispatched to restore order and conduct house-to-house searches for weapons. The city was placed under curfew for six days, and scores of people were reportedly arrested. Your Excellency charged on February 22 that Mr. Shubeilat was responsible for the disturbances, and accused him of """"instigating people to protest against the government which [Shubeilat] described as Zionist and hostile to Iraq.""""  Human Rights Watch takes the position that the right of peaceful assembly includes the right of citizens to express freely through peaceful means their views about issues of national and international concern. The imposition of a categorical and open-ended ban on all forms of peaceful public assembly violates this right. The burden is on the state to justify the necessity of restrictions on freedom of assembly for reasons such as national security, public safety, or public order. A ban on peaceful demonstrations cannot be justified if its intent is to silence opposition voices and suppress freedom of expression. We are deeply concerned that Leith Shubeilat is being prosecuted in the state security court because he exercised his right to freedom of expression, and urged others to express their views in a public manner. No one should be criminally prosecuted for expressing opinions privately or publicly that are critical of the state's domestic or foreign policies. Similarly, no one should be tried for urging others to protest government policies through peaceful means.  Human Rights Watch also finds that the subsequent ban on all press coverage of the Shubeilat case, including but not limited to the proceedings of his public trial in the state security court, violates internationally recognized standards for freedom of expression and unnecessarily restricts the press from reporting news, views and other information to the public. According to Jordanian journalists, the first announcement of the ban came in a letter dated and delivered on March 19 from Bilal al-Tal, director of the press and publications department of the ministry of information. Mr. al-Tal requested that newspapers refrain from publishing any information about the Shubeilat case. He referred to a letter from the state security court prosecutor, Mamoun Khaswaneh, also dated March 19 and included as an attachment, which requested that newspapers withhold from publication """"any news or commentary"""" about the case. The prosecutor cited Article 42 of the 1993 press and publications law as the legal basis for his directive. Article 42 states: """"The publication of the proceedings of any case pending before the Courts prior to the pronouncement of a final ruling shall be prohibited, unless the Court sanctions publication."""" Journalists were troubled because the broad language of the prosecutor's ban exceeded the provisions of Article 42. They stressed that while the law prohibits publication of the actual proceedings in the trial, it does not specifically ban news and analysis about a trial that is in progress, nor does it prohibit other reporting about a defendant and his or her case.  Following the receipt of the letters on March 19, Jordanian newspapers published stories about the ban, and opinion pieces about its legality, including a critical statement issued by Hussein Mjalli, the head of the Jordanian Bar Association and one of Mr. Shubeilat's lawyers. Mr. Mjalli argued that the prosecutor's directive had """"no legal grounds, should not be considered, and its contents should be disregarded."""" He added: """"The decision to ban printing news pertaining to the defendant is considered an infringement on public freedoms guaranteed by the constitution and it strengthens the government's hand in suppressing freedom of the press.""""  According to journalists, authorities were """"furious"""" about this coverage, and additional written warnings were issued. On March 26, Mr. al-Tal sent a second letter to the newspapers, which was accompanied by another letter from the state security court prosecutor, also dated March 26. Mr. al-Tal reiterated that """"no press reports or commentaries"""" about the Shubeilat case could be published. The accompanying letter from the prosecutor stated that the stories that had appeared concerning aspects of the Shubeilat case since March 19 were """"illegal,"""" and warned that violators would be subject to criminal prosecution. The state security prosecutor's letter, which was addressed to Mr. al-Tal, asked the press and publications department take legal action against any violator.  On March 30, the day before Leith Shubeilat's trial began in the state security court, newspapers received a third letter from Mr. al-Tal. He attached a letter from the military judge who heads the security court, Yousef al-Fa'oury. The judge's letter to Mr. al-Tal stated that the court """"has decided in its consideration of Case No. 145/98 against the suspect Leith Shubeilat to ban publication of any details concerning the court proceedings, or commentary on [the proceedings], under the legal responsibility spelled out in the laws in effect. Please take action and request newspapers to implement this decision and abide by Article 42 of the press and publications law.""""  Jordanian journalists emphasized to Human Rights Watch that the ban on coverage represented another serious setback for press freedom. They said that the ban was first communicated to newspapers well in advance of the beginning of the trial, indicating to them that the intent of the authorities was to silence the press and enforce a complete media blackout on any coverage of Mr. Shubeilat -- including news, background information, analysis, and opinions. Journalists also acknowledged the intimidating effect of the threat of prosecution. """"This is a clear violation of the ethics of journalism and not just the law,"""" an editor at a weekly newspaper said, adding that the ban was indicative of a """"martial law mentality"""" that restricts freedom of expression in Jordan. """"Our duty is to report, but this puts us in chains. I could be charged and brought before the court for writing anything about Shubeilat. The military prosecutor should not be giving me orders about what to publish. I am a civilian and a journalist.,"""" he told Human Rights Watch. The editor at a daily newspaper agreed: """"This [ban] is against the law and democracy. We are threatened with being taken to court and maybe to prison.""""  The blanket ban on press coverage of the Shubeilat case is a violation of Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Jordan has ratified. Article 14(1) of the ICCPR permits exclusion of the public and the press """"from all or part of a trial for reasons of morals, public order (ordre public) or national security in a democratic society, or when the interest of the private lives of the Parties so requires, or to the extent strictly necessary in the opinion of the court in special circumstances where publicity would prejudice the interests of justice."""" To our knowledge, authorities have provided no justification of why the Shubeilat court proceedings meet this test and why journalists should be prohibited from reporting about the trial. In the absence of such justification, the ban contravenes Jordan's international obligations in relation to freedom of expression and should be revoked. We are further concerned that the ministry of information and the state security court prosecutor overstepped the provisions of Article 42 of the press and publications law by barring newspapers from publishing commentary or other information about Mr. Shubeilat's case. Their written directives constitute outright censorship of the press, in violation of Article 19 of the ICCPR which guarantees the right to freedom of expression.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about the continuing pattern of restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression in Jordan, and we urge the government to reverse this worrying trend.

The delegation of three groups, Amnesty International, ARTICLE 19, and Human Rights Watch, interviewed more than 200 people from all sections of Kenyan society, including survivors of violent incidents as well as Kenyan government officials. The joint mission was sent in the wake of waning international attention to continuing human rights violations in Kenya, reflecting the seriousness with which the organizations view the situation.   The delegation found the situation particularly serious in the Rift Valley, where killings continue sporadically after the recent mass attacks. More than 100 people have been killed and thousands displaced since the latest violence began in January 1998.   """"Kenya is a powder keg waiting to explode, all the signs are there"""" said Edge Kanyongolo, a spokesperson for the delegation, speaking at a press conference today in Nairobi. """"The downward spiral of violence and ethnic hatred is resulting in increasing human rights violations, and will not end until the government stops using divide and rule tactics.""""   Survivors of violence in the area describe an ongoing """"war"""" in which members of previously mixed communities attack each other with arrows and pangas (machetes). In the first wave of incidents, in Laikipia, guns were also used.   Many survivors are afraid to return to their homes, citing the lack of security in the area and the apparent unwillingness of the authorities to prevent further attacks. The government has systematically failed to investigate and punish armed aggressors, and to protect frightened, angry and displaced people. The human rights delegation expressed fears that the supporters of the ruling party are instigating political violence, but blaming the incidents on spontaneous outbursts of ethnic hatred.   Statements like the following, from one survivor, were common and emphasize that unless the root causes of violence are addressed, people will not return to their homes. He stated that """"when we try to visit our homes, we receive warnings such as ‘even if you till, you are just doing useless things. Even after planting, you will not eat'"""". Someone else expressed a common sentiment: """"My fear is not even for the past or the present but for the future"""".   This violence follows the pattern established in 1991-94, the delegation said, in which supporters of the ruling party, KANU, attacked members of ethnic groups considered to support the political opposition. In that violence, high-ranking government involvement was proven. This time, compelling evidence suggests that the initial attacks were organized from outside the communities.   Attacks occurred only in areas where the opposition Democratic Party (DP) won seats. Violence began within days of KANU politicians visiting the area and verbally threatening DP supporters, who had recently mounted a legal challenge to the presidential election results.   This violence is not occurring in a vacuum. Demands for a system of political pluralism, specifically an inclusive constitutional process, are answered by calls from members of the ruling party to introduce a system of ethnic federalism (Majimboism). There is concern that the manner in which the system is being proposed could be used to strip certain ethnic groups of their rights.   In 1998, the delegation found some worrying new developments, including an increasing use of more sophisticated weapons, and a new tendency to target women for rape and killing. Old people and children are not spared.   The delegation also noted that 1998 was the first time that members of the Kikuyu community retaliated to attacks in an organized fashion, following the failure of the government to act. Subsequently the wave of violence slowed to a trickle, reinforcing calls within that community for armed retaliation to achieve security.   There is an ongoing problem all over Kenya with access to accurate and affordable information, particularly in rural areas. The delegation concluded that this information void provides a fertile ground for acceptance of rumor as fact, and that, reconciliation in such an atmosphere is impossible. The cheapness and availability of firearms can only exacerbate the cycle of revenge.   The delegation concluded that since 1991, when the government was forced to introduce a multiparty system, it has actively undermined freedom of expression and contributed to and promoted a culture of impunity and growing violence, with the aim of undermining genuine and meaningful reforms. Pressure for reforms is continually met with a combination of sticks and carrots, in the form of brutal state violence tempered by promises of change.   Most recently demands for an open and inclusive process of constitutional reform have provoked government threats to deregister non-governmental organizations, and serious harassment of human rights activists.   Despite interventions by the international community on human rights issues in the lead-up to the elections in December 1997, momentum has not been sustained. Small concessions by the Kenyan government, often not carried through, have been hailed as major steps forward, missing the ongoing pattern of government unwillingness to promote and protect the rights of all its citizens regardless of ethnicity or political affiliation.   Kenya is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. Amnesty International, ARTICLE 19, and Human Rights Watch call on the Kenyan government to prevent future human rights violations, hold perpetrators of such violations accountable and defend freedom of speech, association and assembly. The international community should increase pressure on the Kenyan government to uphold its national and international legal obligations and should closely monitor any promised reforms using clearly articulated benchmarks.","Africa, Kenya",""

The Buyoya regime has forced tens of thousands of civilians who lived in areas of rebel activity into regroupment camps and designated camp sites, generally around military posts. The military then carried out """"clean up"""" operations in the countryside, looting and burning homes, and killing thousands of unarmed civilians, many of them women, children, and elderly, who resisted being moved to the camps. Although some camps have been closed in recent months in the north of Burundi, other camps continue to be created in southern Burundi. In the camps, soldiers have summarily executed hundreds of people accused of supporting rebel groups and have tortured and killed many others alleged to have violated camp rules. Soldiers have engaged widely in rape and have instituted forced labor in many camps. The government failed to provide for the sanitary or medical needs of the mass of forcibly displaced civilians. The camps are seriously overcrowded, without water and other facilities. As a result, thousands of people have died of illness. The creation of the camps seriously disrupted agricultural production, leading to chronic malnutrition in some areas. Human Rights Watch calls on the government to immediately close all regroupment camps and to allow the civilian population to return to their homes. In regions where regroupment camps have not been created, the armed forces have frequently responded to Hutu rebel activity by retaliating against civilians and they have summarily executed Hutu civilians suspected of supporting the rebel groups. The report documents several bloody attacks by the armed forces against Hutu civilians in the area around the capital Bujumbura. The armed forces have also engaged in rape, looting, and destruction of property. """"The various Hutu rebel groups, such as the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), have also targeted civilians, particularly Tutsi and Hutu whom they believe to be supporting the government,"""" according to Mr. Takirambudde. The report documents several attacks on civilians by the FDD in southern Burundi . It charges the FDD and other insurgent groups with widespread looting, with having held Hutu civilians against their will in areas under their control and with forcing them to raise crops to feed their troops. These activities have upset usual agricultural production, leaving many people without an adequate food supply.

Since 1991, AZADHO has documented thousands of cases of human rights violations committed by the former Mobutu regime and has been a consistent and leading voice for democracy and human rights in the former Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. During the war which brought Congolese President Kabila to power, AZADHO also denounced civilian killings and human rights abuses by all sides, including those committed by Kabila's forces and their Rwandan allies.

Macedonia's ethnic communities, especially Albanians, are most susceptible to abuse, the report says. But police abuse and due process violations affect all of Macedonia's citizens, regardless of ethnicity. The report notes that opposition political activity and low socio-economic status greatly increase a person's likelihood of being subjected to police abuse.  The most serious form of that abuse is the use of excessive force by the police at the time of arrest, and the physical maltreatment of those in detention. Individuals are sometimes arrested without a warrant and beaten until they confess to a crime. With disturbing frequency, individuals are held longer than the twenty-four hours allowed by law, not informed of the reason for their arrest, and denied immediate access to a lawyer.  The international community has failed to address the illegal behavior of the police and the courts, among other human rights violations. At least U.S. $616 million in foreign aid and loans has been provided to the Macedonian government, which is widely considered a stabilizing force in a sensitive region. The presence of 1,000 U.N. troops has helped keep the peace in Macedonia, but U.N. reporting has downplayed human rights violations. The monitoring mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) has whitewashed human rights abuses in Macedonia, as demonstrated in an appendix of internal OSCE documents to the HRW report.  The U.S. government bears a special responsibility for the behavior of the Macedonian police. It has trained at least 329 police officers, including a group of special forces that were used in the most severe case of police brutality that took place in the town of Gostivar on July 9, 1997.

In a report on Egypt published by our organization in December 1997, we noted that various actions of authorities in 1997 had compromised press freedom for Egyptian and foreign newspapers. These measures included criminal prosecution of journalists for allegedly libelous reports about corrupt practices of government officials or their relatives; blanket bans on press coverage of various newsworthy issues; suspension of the publication of three issues of the biweekly opposition newspaper al-Sh'ab for defying one of these bans; and prohibition of the distribution of an issue of the Arabic daily al-Hayat because a front-page story about a border dispute between Egypt and Sudan was judged biased. According to the Cairo-based Center for Human Rights Legal Aid (CHRLA), there are at least twenty-two court cases or investigations by prosecutors in progress, involving thirty-four journalists who face imprisonment. Three of the journalists -- publisher and editor Mustafa Bakri, journalist and former editor Mahmoud Bakri, and journalist Amr Nasif -- are appealing court rulings that imposed one-year prison sentences, and Gamal Fahmy is appealing a three-month prison sentence. In the context of these developments, Human Rights Watch is alarmed that the pressure on independent journalists has intensified in 1998. Recent comments byYour Excellency appeared to signal the intention of the government to continue policies that penalize and intimidate the independent press. We note with concern Your Excellency's complaint on March 7 about """"the unruliness of the press,"""" andyour serious allegations that some journalists """"are destroying our country"""" and that some newspapers """"harm the homeland's security."""" Your remarks also indicated that unfavorable press coverage of certain foreign governments was not welcome. You asserted that """"some non-Egyptian personalities have infiltrated the Egyptian press to attack their countries' rulers,"""" and that """"someone has contacted a cheap newspaper and paid it a monthly fee in order to curse Saudi Arabia."""" On March 8, Ahmed Harak, the first deputy of the Higher Press Council, reinforced the message that critical reporting about Saudi Arabia was a particularly sensitive issue. In the view of Human Rights Watch, the following actions since the beginning of the year raise concerns about the intent of your government to suppress the dissemination of a broad range of news, information, and opinions by the independent press in Egypt: * On March 21, censors informed the fortnightly English-language Cairo Times of the banning of its March 19 issue from distribution in Egypt because of the subject matter of several articles. One was an interview with author Khalil Abdel Kerim, whose two books were seized by police at a publishing house on January 14, on the order of the higher state security prosecutor, because religious authorities at the Islamic Research Academy of al-Azhar disapproved of their content. The censor also objected to a review of the English translation of al-Balad al-Okhra (The Other Place), a book about life in Saudi Arabia written by Ibrahim Abdel Meguid and published by the American University in Cairo Press. """"The censors told me it was insulting to another Arab country,"""" publisher Hisham Kassem said. Another entry found objectionable was a round-up of commentary from Arabic-language newspapers that criticized the ongoing clamp down on the press. The Cairo Times, which is licensed abroad, is subject to pre-publication censorship as a foreign publication. CHRLA characterized the harassment of the newspaper as """"an additional indicator of the state trend toward limiting the permitted margins of the freedom of the press in Egypt."""" The Cairo Times, and at least thirty-eight other small-circulation periodicals that are licensed abroad, experienced another setback on March 31 when, without any warning, the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones banned by administrative decree the printing of all newspapers and magazines in the zones. These investment zones had been the only places in Egypt where """"off-shore"""" publications could be printed without needing to obtain a separate printing license from authorities. The abrupt implementation of the decree penalized publishers whose next issues were about to be printed. It also disrupted the business operations of printing houses located in the zones, and forced publishers, over the short term at least, to find printers outside Egypt. Fears were also raised that the measure would subject these independent publications to additional forms of bureaucratic harassment or control. * On March 16, an appeals court upheld the 1996 libel conviction of Gamal Fahmy, clearing the way for the imposition of a six-month prison sentence with hard labor, which the journalist is currently serving in Tora Mazra' prison. Fahmy had been prosecuted for an article that he had written in al-Arabi newspaper in which he criticized the views of writer Tharwat Abaza about the origins of the 1956 Suez crisis and described Abaza's father as a British symphathizer. After the appeal court's ruling, Fahmy said that punishments against journalists were expanding """"in a way that would lead you to give up writing altogether. There are no other freedoms in Egypt except for freedom of expression. If they take that away, then what's left?"""" The Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) commented on the court's decision in a statement issued on March 19. It said that imposing prison sentences on journalists """"contradicts international charters which enshrine the freedom of journalists and give them protection to carry out their work,"""" and warned of """"the repercussions of this negative climate on the country's already limited democracy."""" * On March 4, the weekly newspaper of the Misr al-Fatah (Young Egypt) political party was targeted, according to a report that day by Agence France-Presse. The prosecutor general brought libel charges against three of the paper's officials -- president Ahmad Ezzeddin Suleiman, director general Taher Mahmoud Taher, and editor-in-chief Mukhtar Mahmoud Abdel Al -- for articles published in the February 19 edition that accused Finance Minister Moheidin el-Gharib of """"wasting public funds and corruption,"""" prosecutors said. * On February 26, the censorship office in the information ministry informed al-Dustour, which is also licensed abroad, that its license to print and distribute in Egypt had been revoked. This move effectively banned the newspaper from publishing. Editor-in-chief Ibrahim Issa said that the reason provided for this extreme measure was the paper's publication on February 25 of a statement issued by the Islamic Group that leveled various unsubstantiated accusations against Coptic Christian businessmen in Egypt and threatened to kill three of them. In addition to publishing the statement, the paper cited former security officials who cast doubt on the document's authenticity. Censors did not object to the publication of the material; authorities acted only after the issue of the newspaper had been published. Information Minister Safwat Sherif reportedly defended the action by citing the law governing foreign publications, which he said prohibits """"distribution in Egypt of publications which slur religions, spread subversive ideas, or propagate the tracts of terrorist groups."""" The Islamic Group since 1992 has claimed responsibility for acts of violence by its armed wing that have killed and injured hundreds of Egyptian civilians, foreigners, and police and security forces. * On February 24, an appeals court upheld the 1997 libel conviction of Magdi Hussein, editor-in-chief of al-Sha'b, and journalist Muhamed Helmi, and ordered that they serve sentences of one year in prison with hard labor and pay fines for damages to Alaa al-Alfi, the son of former interior minister Hassan al-Alfi. The case stemmed from articles published in al-Sha'b in 1996, accusing the younger Mr. al-Alfi of influence-peddling in his business dealings in Egypt. The newspaper has been repeatedly targeted by authorities for its investigative reporting, particularly on issues related to corruption. Mr. Hussein and Mr. Helmi are currently imprisoned in Tora Mazra' prison. Human Rights Watch is also concerned about recent revisions in the law that grant to the executive branch of government the authority to license new newspapers and other media in Egypt. On January 17, 1998, parliament hurriedly passed amendments to the companies law, Law No. 159 of 1981. Your Excellency ratified the amendments on January 23, despite an appeal from the journalists syndicate on January 19. The legislation transferred to the cabinet of ministers the power to approve the establishment of new newspapers, authority which previously rested with the Higher Press Council, itself only a quasi-independent body. According to CHRLA, there are about thirty cases before the courts challenging the Higher Press Council's denial of licenses to new publications. There was vocal criticism of the circumstances under which these amendments were presented to the parliament, and the lack of consultation or substantive debate. """"The People's Assembly...had not been prepared for the new law and before most deputies realized what was happening, the law had been passed,"""" the weekly Middle East Times reported. """"The people...find the laws before the People's Assembly without any preparation or prior notice,"""" the daily al-Wafd wrote in an editorial on January 19. """"Just as the law was cooked up in the government's kitchen in a matter of hours, it was presented to and passed by the parliament in two hours, while dozens of other laws that affect the people's lives and interests have been locked in the government's drawers for years. The government passes the laws that it wants, and it does so with the same secrecy we have come to expect of it."""" In at least one case, the amended companies law appears to have been applied retroactively to a new independent weekly newspaper, al-Hadaf, which had received a license to publish from the Higher Press Council on June 23, 1997. After the paper was licensed, it secured the various approvals for corporate status and presented the necessary documents to the relevant authorities on December 23, 1997. The authorities, however, halted the remaining final stages of the registration process, leaving the newspaper in legal limbo and unable to publish. Requests by the paper's founders for an official written explanation were refused. Following the passage of the amendments to the companies law on January 23, al-Hadaf was informed that it was now required to obtain a license from the council of ministers, despite the fact that the paper had obtained a license in 1997 under the law that was in force at the time. The founders of the newspaper filed a lawsuit in administrative court, challenging the arbitrary suspension of the corporate registration process and the retroactive application of the revised companies law. As of this writing, the court case is continuing. Human Rights Watch takes the position that freedom of the press must include the freedom to report news, investigate issues of public concern, and publish a diversity of information and views. We also believe that the power to license newspapers and other publications should be vested in an agency or authority that is independent of direct interference by the executive branch of government. The licensing process should be effectively insulated from political pressure, governed by standards that are politically neutral and transparent, and subject to review by an independent judiciary. We respectfully urge Your Excellency to take immediate action to reverse the sharp deterioration of press freedom in Egypt, and ensure that government policies are in conformity with the guarantees of freedom of expression in the Egyptian constitution and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Egypt has ratified. Journalists should be permitted to work freely, and publishers should be allowed to operate, without the threat of state harassment or the risk of imprisonment. We will continue to monitor closely future developments. We thank you in advance for your attention to this important matter, and look forward to a reply at your earliest convenience.

That vulnerability is even greater when, as in many countries of the Arabian Peninsula, domestic law in the receiving country is not only seriously deficient in worker protections, but also fails to meet international fair trial standards. The migrant labor policies of Saudi Arabia, as the Peninsula's pre-eminent political power, and a major importer of labor from Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka and Yemen, have impact far beyond its borders, influencing labor policies in neighboring states and silencing sending countries' complaints with the implicit threat of mass expulsions of their nationals. Although Saudi Arabia took steps in 1997 to lessen the incentives for Saudi nationals to resell work visas or hire illegal workers, the new decrees also significantly increased fines and prison sentences for visa overstayers and other illegal migrants. More importantly, the broader flaws in the labor and legal systems remain unchanged, and efforts to address these shortcomings through the United Nations' confidential """"1503 procedure"""" have not produced any significant human rights improvements. One indicator of the severity of the problem is that of the more than 630 individuals known to have been executed in Saudi Arabia since 1990, more than half have been foreign workers.       Saudi Arabian law gives employers tremendous power over their foreign workers, placing significant restrictions on workers' freedom of movement, while offering almost no avenues of redress for abuses. Foreign workers must be sponsored by a Saudi national, and once in Saudi Arabia the worker must have written authorization from the sponsor to leave the country, travel outside the city of his or her employment, change jobs, or rent an apartment. In many cases employers confiscate workers' passports, leaving them subject to possible arrest and deportation as undocumented aliens. These restrictions on movement sometimes give rise to conditions of forced labor, especially when workers live and work in rural areas, private compounds, or private homes. Women employed as domestic helpers are particularly vulnerable to forced labor, as well as physical and sexual abuse, and all women are subject to additional restrictions forbidding driving, access to certain public places, and """"immoral behavior,"""" including walking alone, not wearing a head scarf, or being in the company of a man who is not a relative. Punishments for the latter include imprisonment and flogging.     These restrictions foster other abuses, because they give employers leverage to force foreign workers to accept wages and working conditions other than those specified in their contracts. Workers regularly report that their employers failed to honor contracts signed in their home countries, including failing to pay wages for months at a time, placing them in lower paid and lower skilled jobs, requiring them to work longer hours than specified, and reneging on promised housing, repatriation, vacation leave, and other benefits. Even contracts that are honored typically contain provisions that can be easily abused, including requirements that workers pay their own travel costs if they are dismissed for incompetence, accept any other work assigned by the employer, refrain from engaging in any outside work, be available to work any additional hours required by the employer, and not be or become pregnant.     Although in theory Saudi Arabia's Labor Commission provides foreign and local workers with a neutral agency to adjudicate and arbitrate labor disputes, rulings often unfairly favor employers, and the Commission's jurisdiction excludes large segments of the working population such as domestic helpers and illegal workers. Commission offices can be difficult to reach, especially for women, and pursuing a complaint may require several visits, a costly and dangerous proposition for workers not in possession of a passport or written authorization to travel to another city. Workers who do bring a case before the Commission may be stranded indefinitely if their employer refuses to allow them to work for someone else or leave the country. In August 1997 the Asia-Pacific Mission for Migrant Filipinos (APMMF) reported that over 500 Filipino workers were stranded in Riyadh because their employers refused to sign exit visas. According to APMMF, """"most of them have grievances lodged at the Saudi Court against their employers or sponsors for contract violations such as non-payment of wages, long hours of work, poor working and living conditions, sexual and physical abuses.""""     Foreign workers accused of crimes must go before Saudi Arabia's regular court system, where convictions may include imprisonment, flogging, amputation of a hand or a hand and a foot, or beheading. Saudi law favors Muslims over non-Muslims and men over women in many kinds of legal disputes, and in practice judges often rule in favor of Saudi nationals when adjudicating disputes involving foreigners. Hearings are held behind closed doors, and defendants have no legal right to legal counsel, interpreters, or access to consular officials during interrogation or trial, nor do they have the right to call or cross-examine witnesses. Convictions can be based solely on confessions obtained during interrogation, a practice that encourages the use of lengthy incommunicado detention and physical and psychological pressure to obtain a confession. International human rights organizations have also documented numerous incidents in which non-Arabic speakers have signed confessions believing they were release forms. Under Saudi law allegations of sexual assault and rape are especially difficult to prove, and victims reporting assaults may be subject to other criminal charges. These multiple shortcomings in the Saudi legal system encourage unscrupulous employers to resort to the threat of arrest on false charges like blasphemy or slander in order to pressure workers to renounce their legal claims to severance pay and other benefits. An employer may also choose to be rid of a worker altogether by testifying against him or her in a case in which conviction would result in deportation or worse; once convicted, the worker also loses any to claim to unpaid wages or benefits.     Although sentences are subject to appeal and review by a higher court, convicted persons do not normally participate in the appeal process, and in many death penalty cases they and their families may not even learn that they have been sentenced until the day of their execution. In the case of `Abd al-Karim al-Naqshabandi, a forty-year-old Syrian national who was arrested on February 13, 1994 and executed on December 13, 1996, family members who visited him in prison on December 9 and 10, 1996 say that he was never informed of his sentence and that they learned of his execution from a newspaper article. While officially charged with """"the practice of works of magic and spells and possession of a collection of polytheistic and superstitious books,"""" documents submitted by al-Naqshabandi to the trial judge detail a series of labor disputes with al-Naqshabandi's employer, Saudi Prince Salman bin Sa`ud bin `Abd al-`Aziz, including more than 224,870 Riyal (US $59,816) in back pay, severance pay and other monies owed to him, which the prince allegedly forced him to renounce in front of witnesses just prior to his arrest. Neither the money nor the body has been returned to the family, and attempts by other family members working in Saudi Arabia to obtain redress resulted in one brother being arrested and eventually deported to Syria after several months of house arrest.     When facing deportation, migrants often find themselves in deportation centers where conditions are far below international standards, whose crowded holding areas lack proper ventilation or sanitary facilities. The situation worsens during Saudi Arabia's periodic crackdowns on visa overstayers and other illegal migrants, when the numbers arrested often exceed deportation centers' capacity and the overflow is held at even more crowded police stations until space is found. Deportees who lack money to pay for their repatriation may be held for months or years before returning home, and those who lack passports are dependent on their embassies to provide them with new travel documentation, a process that can also take months.    Recommendations:     Human Rights Watch calls on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to:     Request the special rapporteurs on racism and on violence against women to undertake a joint study of Saudi Arabian laws and practices which may result in discriminatory practices against women and migrant workers;   Urge the governments of Saudi Arabia and of countries with migrant workers in Saudi Arabia to:   --ratify the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families;     --ensure that worker protection under domestic labor law applies to all categories of employment in which migrant workers are found, including domestic service;     --ensure that foreign consular officials are fully knowledgeable about the rights and difficulties of migrant workers and have procedures in place to help their own nationals, legal or illegal, in need; and     --adopt a policy to protect all workers, including illegal workers, who wish to bring criminal charges against abusive employers.","Middle East/North Africa, Saudi Arabia","United Nations"

Washington, D.C. 20530 Dear General Reno: We are writing to express our serious concern for six Iraqi nationals whom the United States government evacuated from Iraq in 1996 and who now face deportation. According to the Department of State, secret classified evidence was used to deny political asylum to all six men who reportedly had worked with C.I.A.-backed resistance groups in Iraq before their evacuation. The evidence offered to support their deportation was confidential and attorneys representing the Iraqis were unable to challenge the information or cross-examine FBI agents who testified against their clients. If the six men are deported to Iraq, the U.S. will be in clear violation of international human rights protections prohibiting the return of individuals who, if returned to their country of origin, would face persecution or torture. Article 3(1) of the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, ratified by the U.S. in 1994, states, """"No State Party shall expel, return or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture."""" Human Rights Watch has been actively monitoring the abysmal human rights conditions in Iraq since 1989. Our 1998 World Report describes the ways in which the government of Iraq continues to engage in a broad range of gross human rights abuses including mass arrests, """"disappearances,"""" and extrajudicial executions with no pretense of due process. The Department of State also recognized in its January 1998 report on human rights practices worldwide that the Iraqi government """"continues to summarily execute perceived political opponents, and reports of such summary executions increased significantly during the year."""" Those detained by the Iraqi government are """"routinely tortured"""" by security services using such techniques as """"branding, electric shocks administered to the genitals and other areas, beating, burning with hot irons, suspension from rotating ceiling fans, dripping acid on the skin, rape, breaking of limbs, denial of food and water, and threats to rape or harm relatives"""" according to the Department of State report. Human Rights Watch has consistently opposed the provision of the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act allowing the use of secret evidence in court as fundamentally unfair. United States constitutional protections prohibit the use of secret evidence in criminal prosecutions where, if convicted, individuals risk a loss of liberty. The consequences for asylum seekers in immigration court are more severe; those against whom secret evidence is used risk being sent to their death. If loss of liberty in the criminal context justifies limiting the use of secret evidence, then surely the government in this case should not be allowed to deport the Iraqi asylum seekers to Iraq, where their very lives would be in danger, without giving them a chance to rebut the evidence provided against them. We urge you to ensure that the U.S. respects its obligations under international human rights law by not deporting the six men in question to Iraq. In this case, the United States' compliance with its treaty obligations is particularly critical since the C.I.A.'s role in supporting dissident activities in Iraq, the participation of the United States in the evacuation of these men, and the high-profile denial of asylum all serve to increase the likelihood that the men will be singled out upon return to their country. We understand that former C.I.A. director James Woolsey has offered to represent the Iraqis using his security clearance to review the secret evidence entered against them. While we view his unique offer as a positive step that may ultimately prevent the men from being deported to Iraq, we nevertheless urge you to grant the Iraqis a new asylum hearing that observes basic due process, including the right to personally know and confront all evidence introduced at their deportation hearing.

The delegation's visit was negotiated during last October's summit meeting between U.S. President Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Washington, DC.  """"The delegation deserves credit for its principled approach, for frankly and directly raising issues of religious freedom at the highest levels with Chinese authorities, and for meeting with a broad range of both official and unofficial religious figures,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But dialogue and discussion are no substitute for press concrete action by China to ease its controls on religious expression. The White House should not be allowed to use this visit as an excuse for abandoning virtually all forms of pressure on Beijing to improve its human rights performance. """"  Three prominent clerics chosen by the White House led the eighteen-day tour of Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Lhasa, and Hong Kong: Rabbi Arthur Schneier of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation in New York, U.S. Roman Catholic Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, New Jersey, and Reverend Don Argue of the National Council of Evangelicals. Notably absent from the delegation were representatives of the Buddhist or Moslem faiths, though concerns about religious repression in Tibet and Xinjiang were on the delegation's agenda. The clerics held a press conference in New York today to release a report summarizing the results of their mission.  """"We were encouraged to see their criticism of the Chinese government's requirement that all religious sites register with the official Religious Affairs Bureau,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Their report also focused on the need to protect freedom of religious practice as well as religious belief, which was useful. And we welcomed their strong condemnation of the use of administrative punishments imposed on some religious believers, namely reeducation through labor, as `out of line with international norms.'""""  While in China, the nine-member delegation held more than fifty meetings with government officials including President Jiang Zemin. The group stressed it was not a fact-finding body, and limited its mission to conducting a dialogue and advocating on behalf of religious activists and groups in jeopardy.  The delegation gave Chinese officials a list of thirty imprisoned religious activists, but failed to secure promises of their release; as far as we know, they also did not receive any significant new information about their whereabouts or legal status. It is not clear whether the group urged the Chinese government to act on the findings of a U.N. official who visited China and Tibet in November 1994 -- the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance -- or received any assurances that the U.N.'s recommendations would be implemented. The Special Rapporteur urged, among other things, that the Chinese constitution be amended to broaden the definition of religious freedom, and called for the release of anyone detained for membership in """"unofficial"""" religious organizations.  Human Rights Watch criticized the delegation's decision to go on a showcase tour of a prison in Lhasa, Tibet on February 26, 1998, providing the authorities with a major propaganda coup. The head of the prison told Bishop McCarrick that well-documented reports of torture and ill-treatment of imprisoned Buddhist monks and nuns were just """"stories,"""" and the group was shown a prison factory in which """"scores of inmates were weaving blankets, with some humming popular songs,"""" according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency.  While the U.S. clerics did succeed in meeting some underground religious activists, they were prevented by authorities from seeing others. But while in China, the delegation was reluctant to publicly criticize moves by Chinese officials to detain or put under house arrest some Protestant and Catholic activists in Beijing, Shanghai and Hebei province during their visit. For example, Dr. Xu Yonghai, a religious activist in Beijing, was held under tight surveillance with three or four plainclothes police stationed outside of his apartment.  The delegation said one of its aims was to put the issue of religion on China's agenda, but this is a basic misreading of the importance Chinese leaders already attach to the issue, which is viewed as a problem of state control. In its 145-page report, China: State Control of Religion, issued last October, Human Rights Watch made clear that since 1982 the Chinese government has never minimized its determination to coopt religious believers for as long as it takes to establish a truly atheist state. The government is determined to contain religious expression and to depict that effort to the international community as lawful. For example, the government requires all religious delegations to register with authorities so that they can be easily monitored; screens the choice of clerics and other religious personnel; and exerts control over religious publications.  China's control of religious expression consistently flouts accepted international standards -- including Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which China announced just six days ago that it was prepared to sign. There is no indication as to when Beijing intends to sign and ratify the Covenant -- or whether Clinton will delay his June visit if action is not taken on the ICCPR by June.  The delegation expressed dismay at the situation in Tibet, and urged that """"a special attention should be paid to the problems"""" of religious believers in Tibet. Their view is widely shared by those in the human rights community who have long monitored the severe repression in Tibet including the """"patriotic reeducation of monks and nuns, expulsions of those who refuse to renounce independence and the Dalai Lama, secular control of monasteries, official limits on the numbers of monks and nuns, and the detention and torture of Buddhist activists.  """"We realize that improvements in religious freedom will probably be gradual and incremental,"""" Jendrzejczyk observed. """"And the members of the delegation are clearly committed to persisting in pushing for change. But we would strongly oppose any attempt by the White House to use the possibility of further such missions to justify its decision to drop all serious pressure on China on human rights."""" President Clinton, who met with the delegation prior to its departure for China, is expected to receive the group at the White House at a date yet to be announced.

""""The human rights crisis in Algeria is very alarming, and the government has refused to allow human rights investigators access to the country,"""" said Joanna Weschler, United Nations representative of Human Rights Watch. """"We are calling on the Commission to appoint a special rapporteur to examine the massacres and the government's possible role in them."""" Algeria has long stated its agreement """"in principle"""" to a visit by U.N. experts on torture and executions, but has never permitted the visit to take place, and has rebuffed all requests for visits by private groups, including Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch also called on the Commission, which meets until April 24, to maintain its scrutiny of the Congo, where the new government of Laurent Kabila has cracked down on civil society and undermined the U.N.'s investigation into massacres of Rwandan refugees, most recently by arresting witnesses who talked to investigators. The organization also urged the Commission to express deep concern at the deterioration of the situation in Burma, and to urge the government to stop blocking access to the rapporteur and to an International Labour Organization probe into forced labor. The group also requested the Commission to:  place human rights field officers in and around the Sudan, to monitor both government and rebel abuses;  call on the Cambodian authorities to bring to justice those responsible for the killing of opposition leaders and violent attacks on the press;  expand the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia;  press the authorities in the former Yugoslavia to hand over suspects indicted by the international tribunal;  express concern over on-going repression and the detention of activists in Bahrain;  send human rights experts to Tajikistan where widespread abuses threaten a fragile peace agreement.  Human Rights Watch also supported High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson's request that the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, Mr. Bacre Waly Ndiaye, be able to visit Kosovo immediately in order to report to the Commission. While welcoming China's decision to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the group deplored the decision of western countries not to pursue a resolution on China. """"The pattern of flagrant, widespread human rights violations in China and Tibet remains basically unchanged,"""" Weschler said, """"and China's rights record deserves U.N. condemnation.""""  Human Rights Watch will also bring before the Commission evidence of degrading prison conditions in the United States, in particular the intransigence of the government in addressing pervasive sexual abuse and inhumane treatment by prison staff of women incarcerated in state prisons. The group will also offer documentation of poor conditions of confinement of thousands of asylum seekers and other immigrants who are housed, sometimes indefinitely, in inappropriate criminal environments. The group will also raise concerns about jails in Brazil, about the widespread use of torture in Russia, Uzbekistan, Peru and Turkey and about the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.  Human Rights Watch will also urge the Commission to strengthen its system of special rapporteurs and working groups. """"The use of urgent action appeals has often saved lives,"""" said Weschler.

Previous international visitors to Nigeria from bodies such as the United States, the Commonwealth, or the African Commission on Human and People's Rights, have had difficulties obtaining permission from the Nigerian government to gain access to detainees. Moreover, although the Nigerian government has promised the U.N. and others to review the cases of those held without charge, no one has in fact been released. Recent months have seen a spate of fresh detentions of journalist, human rights activists, and even military officers alleged to have been involved in a coup attempt.  Human Rights Watch also urged the pope to raise concerns about the transition program by which the military is supposedly returning Nigeria to elected civilian rule, including military control of the electoral commission and restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Hoping for more last minute concessions from Beijing, the Administration has delayed making a decision on whether to sponsor a resolution on China at the United Nations Human Rights Commission, which meets from March 16-April 24 in Geneva. The White House also confirmed this week that President Clinton expects to visit China as early as June this year.  """"The President's decision to visit China soon has set the stage for a major retreat on human rights,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"If the president visits China without clear human rights preconditions, and also drops any resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva, what leverage will the U.S. use to press for concrete progress?""""  In a demarche to the European Union last year, the U.S. outlined its key benchmarks for going ahead or dropping a U.N. resolution in Geneva. It has repeatedly communicated the terms to the Chinese government. They include releasing political prisoners on medical grounds, signing and submitting for ratification two U.N. human rights conventions, and resuming discussions with the International Committee of the Red Cross on prison visits. The Chinese government now appears to be on the verge on meeting these very minimal conditions.  But the pattern of flagrant, widespread human rights violations in China and Tibet remains basically unchanged, Human Rights Watch said, and China's rights record deserves condemnation by the U.N. """"A resolution should take note of the promises and limited steps China has taken in response to international pressure. But it would be a huge mistake to remove that pressure just as Beijing is beginning to respond,"""" Jendrzejczyk said.  China's foreign minister announced on March 12 that it would sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), but did not specify when the signing would take place, or when China would ratify the treaty. In addition, the Chinese government may take exception to certain provisions of the treaty. In recent weeks it has quietly approached European governments to assess what reservations they attached when adhering to the treaty. Chinese legal authorities, for example, have expressed reluctance to endorse the treaty's right to freedom of expression (Article 19 of the ICCPR).  Last October, President Jiang Zemin signed another key treaty, the U.N.Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but the National People's Congress (NPC), now in session in Beijing until March 19, has taken no action thus far to ratify it. Neither treaty is fully binding on China until ratification takes place.  Human Rights Watch would welcome the release of Wang Dan, a student activist imprisoned in October 1996 for eleven years on charges of subverting the government, or the release of other political and religious dissidents. But such releases should not take place on the condition they go into exile. And the Clinton Administration should avoid playing China's game of using token prisoner releases as bargaining chips in exchange for Presidential trips or U.N. resolutions. The U.S. should also not attempt to use the ICRC's talks with Chinese authorities on prison access to justify its flawed policy on human rights.  """"Clinton seems determined to make history by being the first U.S. president to walk in Tiananmen Square since the 1989 massacre, regardless of China's dismal human rights record,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. A presidential visit should only take place in the context of meaningful steps by Beijing that go beyond dialogue or promises. Those steps should include releasing unconditionally large numbers of prisoners, revising its draconian security laws and abolishing arbitrary administrative detention, protecting freedom of association of workers, easing religious repression, and allowing regular access to Tibet for human rights monitors.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

We hope you will use your good offices to take up some of these fundamental issues with the military government in Nigeria during your visit.   Human Rights Watch welcomed the appeals you made to President Fidel Castro during your recent visit to Cuba, in which you asked him to release political prisoners and other prisoners on humanitarian grounds, and stressed the importance of freedom of expression and association. We note with appreciation that President Castro has in fact released some 300 prisoners following your visit. The Nigerian government also holds a large number of political prisoners, and we hope that you will take the opportunity of your visit to Nigeria to appeal for their release. An incomplete list of those currently in custody for political reasons, whether held without trial or charged (or convicted by unfair processes) for politically motivated offenses, is attached to this letter. The list undoubtedly omits the names of many people who are held for political reasons, since information is difficult to obtain especially for those held outside Lagos; and the details of some of those on the list may be incorrect, for similar reasons. We respectfully request you to raise the cases of all the detainees mentioned, inquire as to their current welfare, urge proper medical attention to be given where necessary, request permission to visit the longest-standing prisoners or those whose health is worst, and appeal for their release.   The fact that the conditions of detention in Nigeria are life-threatening was highlighted by the death of the former deputy head of state Major General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua on December 8, 1997. Yar'Adua was convicted in 1995, with about forty others, of involvement in an alleged coup plot, following a trial before a military tribunal which blatantly failed to meet international standards of due process. He was held in Abakaliki prison, where he had been intermittently taken ill for about one year before his death. On December 16, 1997, it was announced that six prisoners had died from typhoid fever in Uyo prison, Akwa Ibom State, including Patrick Usikekpo, also convicted of involvement in the 1995 coup.   Other alleged coup plotters from the 1995 trial who have recently been reported to have spent time in hospital include former head of state Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, pro-democracy activists Dr. Beko Ransome-Kuti and Mallam Shehu Sani, and former head of army legal services Colonel Bello Fadile. The health of Beko Ransome-Kuti and Shehu Sani is particularly at risk. There are also health concerns for the four journalists convicted in the trial (Chris Anyanwu, George Mbah, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle Ajibade), and for other high profile detainees, including Chief M.K.O. Abiola and union leaders Frank Kokori and Milton Dabibi. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, a lawyer from the chambers of Gani Fawehinmi currently detained without charge, is reportedly very sick.   In addition, we are deeply disturbed about the general human rights situation in Nigeria, which has continued to deteriorate. We also enclose with this letter a summary of some of our current concerns about the human rights situation in Nigeria, as well as a copy of our recent report, Transition or Travesty? Nigeria's Endless Process of Return to Civilian Rule. Among the many serious human rights abuses committed by the Nigerian government against its people, the central issue is the denial of their right to choose their own government. The current """"transition program"""" supposedly designed to restore Nigeria to elected civilian government on October 1, 1998, is wholly fraudulent. All those who criticize the program or the government are potentially subject to harassment including arbitrary and prolonged detention or even summary or arbitrary execution. The Nigerian government undermines the rule of law through the use of special tribunals, clauses excluding the courts from inquiring into the legality of executive acts, and disobedience to court orders.   We urge you to use your good offices to call on the military government in Nigeria to respect international standards relating to free political activity. In particular, the Nigerian government should appoint a genuinely independent electoral commission to implement an open and fair process of registration of political parties and screening of candidates, and should allow freedom in practice for political parties to organize, hold meetings, campaign and canvass support from voters, as well as for journalists and others to comment on the political process. The government should repeal all decrees and laws suspending the constitutional protection of fundament human rights, allowing indefinite detention without charge, preventing the courts from considering the legality of executive acts, or criminalizing peaceful criticism of the transition program or of the government.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/03/13/current-violations-human-rights-nigeria","Current Violations of Human Rights in Nigeria","Current Violations of Human Rights in Nigeria","Appendix to a Letter to the Pope","03/13/1998","The human rights situation in Nigeria continues to deteriorate. The current """"transition program"""" supposedly designed to restore Nigeria to civilian elected government on October 1, 1998, is wholly fraudulent. Anyone who criticizes the program or the government may be subject to harassment, including arbitrary and prolonged detention or even arbitrary execution. There is no evidence that the government intends to halt the flagrant violations listed below.    1. Violations of the right to vote and participate in public affairs     Nigeria has been ruled by military governments for all but ten years of its post-independence history. The current ruler, Gen Sani Abacha, took power in a coup in 1993, after the annulment of elections designed to return Nigeria to civilian government. The presumed winner of those elections, M.K.O. Abiola, has been in detention charged with treasonable felony since 1994, after he declared himself president on the anniversary of the elections. A fresh transition program announced in October 1995 is underway, but elections for local and state governments have not been free or fair. All the indications are that General Abacha himself will stand for election in presidential elections due in August, and thus ensure that the military remains in power if not technically in office.    The principal problems with the transition program include the following. There is no independent electoral commission. Only five political parties have been registered, none of them with a political program, all of them close to the military government. Four of the five have announced that Abacha is their preferred """"consensus candidate."""" Candidates in local and state-level elections have been screened and disqualified on spurious security grounds. The draft 1995 constitution, intended to come into effect at the completion of the program in October 1998, has not been promulgated or even published.    Meetings of pro-democracy and human rights groups, as well as other gatherings of people seen to be critical of the government, are frequently disrupted. For example, in September 1997, security officers broke up the farewell party organized by the human rights community for outgoing U.S. ambassador, Walter Carrington. Journalists critical of the government are subjected to harassment and detention, while the laws governing the transition program make criticism of the program itself a crime.    2. Arbitrary detention and harassment of the opposition     Since October 1997, the number of detentions, especially of journalists and human rights activists, has increased alarmingly. The State Security (Detention of Persons) Decree No.2 of 1984 permits indefinite detention without trial. Blatantly political charges of treason, sedition, or other offenses, including charges of corruption, are also used to silence critics. Among those recently arrested are Ogaga Ifowodo of the Civil Liberties Organisation; Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, a lawyer from the chambers of well-known human rights lawyer Gani Fawehinmi; Onome Osifo-Whiskey, the managing editor of the outspoken Tell magazine, and Batom Mitee, the brother of Ledum Mitee, exiled acting president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and co-defendant with Ken Saro-Wiwa.    The situation in Ogoniland is particularly serious, and suspected members or leaders in MOSOP are regularly detained. Security forces arrested and detained several dozen people in Ogoni in November and December 1997. An unknown number remain in detention. MOSOP reports that two people were recently killed by security forces: Beatrice Nwakpasi, shot dead by soldiers who opened fire on a crowd of dancing people celebrating Ogoni Day on January 4; and Daniel Naador, detained in connection with the January 4 celebrations and beaten so severely that he died in custody two weeks later.    An alleged coup plot on December 21, 1997 has given the authorities a pretext to detain several dozen army officers and civilians, and charge a number of them with treason. Among them is Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, previously deputy head of state, who is rumored to have urged General Abacha not to stand as a candidate for the presidency in the forthcoming elections. In November 1997, Gen. Sani Abacha made one of his periodic announcements that a review of detainees would be undertaken and that the government would grant amnesty """"to those detained persons whose release would constitute no further impediment to the peace and security of our country."""" Despite some further official references to the review of cases and the release of detainees, there is no evidence that a review panel has in fact been set up. Most worrisomely, the Inspector General of Police, Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie, has denied in the last few days that General Abacha has made any promise to review the cases of political detainees.    In addition to detention, critics of the government are subjected to general harassment by the security forces, especially the State Security Service (SSS). This harassment is generally more severe outside Lagos, where opponents of the government are more exposed, but Lagos-based human rights lawyers, journalists, pro-democracy activists or opposition members are also subject to regular SSS attention. The government also regularly confiscates the passports of those it would rather did not travel overseas to speak about Nigeria.    3. Conditions of detention     Conditions of detention in Nigeria are generally life-threatening. If a detainee (political or criminal) does not have access to visitors who can bring food, clothes and other assistance (such as medicines) on his or her behalf, any prolonged period of detention is likely to result in severe damage to health, and possibly death. Only about N30 (U.S. 35›) per day is allocated per prisoner for food. Overcrowding is serious, with many prisons holding several hundred percent more prisoners than their nominal capacity. In addition, health care and medical facilities are grossly inadequate; approximately 4,000 prisoners die in custody a year, or 7 percent of the prison population of approximately 50,000.    4. Extrajudicial executions     Several cases of shootings of people apparently for political reasons have taken place since late 1995. A partial list:  On February 26, 1998, armed men broke into the home of Tunde Oladepo, a journalist with The Guardian (Lagos) based in Abeokuta, Ogun State, and shot him dead in front of his family. Oladepo had recently written a story criticizing traditional rulers, including the chief of the local area, for endorsing the candidacy of General Abacha for president. On December 13, 1997 a bomb explosion at Lagos airport apparently aimed at Lieutenant General Oladipo Diya killed one person. The bomb was timed to explode during the delayed flight that Diya was to take. Diya himself was detained ten days later on allegations of involvement in a coup plot. On January 14, 1997, gunmen shot at Senator Abraham Adesanya the Deputy chairman of Nigeria opposition movement NADECO. The glass of his car was shattered though he suffered minor injuries. On June 4, 1996, Kudirat Abiola, wife of imprisoned president-elect Moshood K.O. Abiola was shot dead by a group of unidentified men as she was traveling on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on her way to see the Canadian High Commissioner.  It is assumed by most Nigerians that these assassinations or assassination attempts were carried out on behalf of the Nigerian military government. No credible progress has been made in the investigations into the killings.   5. Death penalty   In January 1997, it was reported by the Military Administrator of Akwa Ibom State that 293 condemned prisoners were awaiting execution in the state. Large numbers of people are on death row in other states, though statistics are difficult to obtain. Many of those sentenced to death have been convicted by armed robbery tribunals, which do not respect international standards of due process. The tribunal members are directly appointed by the military authorities and are therefore not independent of government control. The judge who presides over the tribunal must hand down the death penalty if he or she convicts an individual of armed robbery (whether or not weapons were actually fired during a robbery), and, while the military administrator of each state must confirm each death sentence, there is no appeal to a higher tribunal or court in which the legal issues may be re-examined. Execution is by firing squad, usually public.    6. Undermining courts and the rule of law     It is the uniform opinion of Nigerian human rights activists that the quality of judicial appointments has deteriorated under the current government, and that the level of executive interference in court decisions has increased.    The court system in Nigeria is seriously starved of funds. Judges, magistrates and other court officers, including prosecutors (and police, who often act as prosecutors), are very poorly paid. Court facilities are hopelessly overcrowded, badly equipped and underfunded. Court libraries are inadequate, and judges may even have to supply their own paper and pens to record their judgments in long hand. There are long delays in bringing both criminal and civil cases to court. This financial crisis encourages the acceptance of bribes by judicial officers.   The regular court system in Nigeria has been seriously undermined by the creation of special tribunals, both to hear politically sensitive cases and to bypass the delays of the court system in the trial of high profile crimes. Most notorious of these tribunals are those created under the Civil Disturbances (Special Tribunal) Decree No.2 of 1987. One such tribunal tried the internationally-known human rights figure Ken Saro-Wiwa and the other eight Ogoni activists executed on November 10, 1995. Military decrees frequently include """"ouster clauses,"""" which prevent the regular courts from inquiring into the exercise of powers given by the decree. The Nigerian government regularly disregards the court orders made against it anyway. In almost all cases of detention of high-profile political or human rights activists, court orders have been obtained allowing members of the family or private doctors to see the detainee, or declaring that the detainee should be produced in court. The government routinely refuses to respect these directives.","Africa, Nigeria",""

""""By opening an immediate investigation into the apparent war crimes being committed in Kosovo, your office would signal that the Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to these atrocities and, we hope, help to curtail them,"""" said the letter.      Full text of the letter follows.      Open Letter to Judge Louise Arbour   Chief Prosecutor,   International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia     Judge Louise Arbour   Chief Prosecutor   ICC   Church illplein 1   PO Box 13888   2501 EW Den Haag   The Netherlands     March 7, 1998     Dear Judge Arbour,     Human Rights Watch is writing to express its grave concern about recent Serbian military actions in the region of Kosovo. Evidence strongly suggests that war crimes are being committed, including arbitrary and indiscriminate attacks against civilians and the summary execution of detainees. We call on you to launch an immediate investigation of theses apparent atrocities and to announce your office's intention to prosecute those responsible before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Prompt action by your office can help deter further atrocities and save lives.     On February 28, 1998, Serbian police, paramilitaries, and possibly army units began a massive assault on a triangle of villages in Kosovo's Drenica region, believed to be a base for the Kosova Liberation Army (KLA). Tanks and attack helicopters have been used in what the Yugoslav government describes as """"a sweep for terrorists."""" Human Rights Watch has received highly credible reports that Serbian forces have indiscriminately attacked civilians and other non-combatants, especially in the villages of Cirez, Likosane, Prekaz, and Lausha. The press has also reported that helicopters and armored vehicles sprayed village rooftops with gunfire before security forces entered the village on foot and fired indiscriminately into private homes. In some cases, the Serbian security forces reportedly came under fire from unidentified individuals, possibly from the private homes, and it appears now that a battle between the KLA and Serbian forces has begun. Foreign journalists have seen the bodies of six victims, including a pregnant woman, Rukia Nebihi, who had been shot in the face, and four brothers from the Sejdiu family, two of whom had been shot in the back. Thus far, twenty-four ethnic Albanians are confirmed killed, although the precise number is unknown since humanitarian aid organizations and journalists have been denied access to the region.     According to the Prishtina-based Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, ten members of the Ahmeti family and two of their guests, Behram Fazliu and Shaban Muja, were killed by Serbian security forces after having been detained, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the Serbian government, the police confiscated a large amount of weapons and arrested a number of people, although their whereabouts and the charges against them are currently unknown. Four Serbian policemen were also killed during the action.     Human Rights Watch recognizes that the authorities may have to use force when confronted with an armed attack, but attacks against civilians and the summary execution of anyone in detention is a war crime, a severe violation of international humanitarian law. Given the level of armed conflict that has now broken out in Kosovo, common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, which governs internal armed conflicts, clearly applies. It requires that civilians and other protected persons be treated humanely, with specific prohibitions of murder, torture, and cruel, humiliating or degrading treatment.     The violations of humanitarian law apparently being committed in Kosovo fall under the purview of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. Article 1 of the Tribunal's statute states that the Tribunal has the power to prosecute individuals who have committed violations of international humanitarian law on the """"territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991."""" Article 8 further specifies that the Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction """"shall extend to a period beginning on 1 January 1991."""" There is no end point to this temporal jurisdiction. By opening an immediate investigation into the apparent war crimes being committed in Kosovo, and signaling that the Tribunal's jurisdiction extends to these atrocities, your office can help to curtail them.     Sincerely,   Kenneth Roth   Executive Director, Human Rights Watch","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Witnesses In Congo (Drc)","","03/05/1998","Human Rights Watch expressed serious concern that witnesses who gave testimony to his investigative team in the Democratic Republic of Congo (ex-Zaire) have been arrested by the government, in a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi A, Annan.   A copy of the letter is attached.   H.E. Secretary-General Kofi A. Annan United Nations Headquarters - S-3800 New York, N.Y. 10017 By Hand   Dear Mr. Secretary-General,   We write to convey Human Rights Watch's gravest concerns about reports we have received from the Democratic Republic of Congo that witnesses who gave testimony to your investigative team (SGIT) in the northwestern city of Mbandaka were arrested by the government. According to reliable information, on at least two occasions during the SGIT's recent inquiry into allegations of massacres of Hutu refugees in the area, government security forces broke in to meetings with witnesses -- journalist Inpongie and a local Red Cross worker -- and took the witnesses for questioning. A third witness, Pastor Abbé Florent, was reportedly arrested twice, both before and after giving information to the SGIT.   At a February 27 briefing at United Nations headquarters, a UN Centre for Human Rights representative told NGOs of the SGIT's concern regarding the arrest of people who spoke to its investigators. The representative gave no further details, and had no ready answer to questions raised by NGO representatives about the provisions envisaged by the SGIT to protect its informants.   There is indeed a vital need for specific protection provisions. When, at your invitation, Human Rights Watch briefed the departing members of your team in Geneva last August, we stressed the protection of the mission's sources as one of our principal concerns. Our latest reports on the DRC: """"What Kabila is Hiding: Civilian Killings and Impunity in Congo,"""" and """"Uncertain Course: Transition and Human Rights Violations in the Congo,"""" published in October and December 1997 respectively, documented cases of detention, torture, and """"disappearance"""" of individuals whom the government publicly accused of being """"agents"""" for the SGIT or suspected of merely having spoken to outsiders about massacres they witnessed. We called on the international community to hold the government accountable for these practices as firmly as for the crimes they sought to cover up. The present arrests would appear to have the same objective.   We have, many times in the past, expressed to you our concern regarding both the DRC government's repeated obstructions of the two UN investigations as well as the UN's own firmness in pursuing the probe. We received with guarded optimism the news of the SGIT's redeployment to Mbandaka as of February 11, 1998, and continue to monitor the progress of its vital work through our colleagues on the ground. We are increasingly concerned, however, that the many delays, combined with the chilling effect of the recent   arrests, will make it difficult for the SGIT successfully to complete its investigation and determine responsibility for the incidents in question.   We strongly urge you to press the DRC government to immediately release any witnesses who may still be in custody, to abstain from any form of harassment of witnesses, to publicly urge citizens to cooperate fully with the SGIT, and to set an example by providing the team with all information it has on the allegations, including the names of the military commanders who took part in the operation in Mbandaka and similar operations under investigation, together with the full military chain-of-command. We also urge you to ask that the SGIT make public any similar incidents of harassment or detention of witnesses and establish clear mechanisms to guarantee their present and future safety.   Thanking you for your attention to this important matter, we have the honor to remain,   Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Joanna Weschler Executive Director for Africa UN Representative   cc: Mrs. Mary Robinson Mr. Kieran Prendergast Mr. Shashi Tharoor Ms. Elisabeth Lindenmayer","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","United Nations"

Olisa was detained by police in Lagos on Tuesday and subsequently charged with holding an illegal meeting.  Agbakoba reportedly intervened with police who were preparing to disperse a crowd which had gathered for the rally, asking them to allow the meeting to go ahead peacefully. He was then dragged into a van and taken to Panti Street police station, Yaba, where he was held overnight. He was beaten on his face with the butt of a rifle. At least twenty to thirty others were also detained at the rally, though Agbakoba and some others have been released.  Human Rights Watch believes that Olisa Agbakoba and the others held have been arrested purely to prevent them exercising their rights to free speech guaranteed under international law and by the Nigerian constitution.

As many as twelve people may have been summarily executed. We urge the U.S. government, European Union and OSCE to coordinate and intensify diplomatic pressure on the Yugoslav authorities to avert an escalation of violence, and to undertake an immediate investigation to determine the nature of the violations. The violence took place over the weekend February 28-March 1 in the Drenica region of Kosovo. According to media reports, two Serbian policemen were killed in an ambush by ethnic Albanians on Friday, February 27, in Likosane village near Glogovac. The next day, Serbian security forces with armored vehicles and attack helicopters swept through the region, sealing off between seven and ten ethnic Albanian villages. The security forces conducted house to house raids, ostensibly looking for members of the Kosova Liberation Army, a shadowy ethnic Albanian military organization that has taken credit for a series of violent attacks against Serbian authorities in Kosovo over the past year.  Local human rights groups, Albanian and international media reported that the security forces used indiscriminate force against civilians, especially in the villages of Cirez and Likosane. Witnesses told reporters that helicopters and APCs sprayed village rooftops with gunfire before security forces entered the village on foot, firing indiscriminately into private homes, although reports also indicate that the police were coming under fire from unidentified individuals, possibly from the private homes. Sixteen ethnic Albanians were killed, according to the Serbian authorities, although Albanian media outlets say the number may be as high as thirty. Foreign journalists have seen the bodies of six victims, including a pregnant woman, Rukia Nebihi, who had been shot in the face, and four brothers from the Sejdiu family, two of whom had been shot in the back.  According to the Prishtina-based Council for the Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms, ten members of the Ahmeti family and two of their guests, Behram Fazliu and Shaban Muja, were killed by Serbian security forces after having been detained, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the Serbian government, the police confiscated a large amount of weapons and arrested a number of people, although their whereabouts and the charges against them are currently unknown. Four Serbian policemen were also killed during the action. Human Rights Watch recognizes that the authorities may have to use force when confronted with an armed attack, but this force may only be applied to the extent necessary to perform their duties. Even if the hostilities in Kosovo rise to the level of an internal armed conflict, international humanitarian law clearly protects civilians and other individuals who are not taking part in the hostilities, including those who have been taken into detention. Human Rights Watch has not conducted an on-site investigation, but credible reports suggest that the Serb security forces may have either indiscriminately attacked civilian groups or even targeted individuals not involved in the fighting. Human Rights Watch is especially concerned that the ten members of the Ahmeti family and their two guests may have been killed by extrajudicial execution. On March 2, a large crowd of ethnic Albanians [estimates range from 30,000-100,000 people] gathered at 10:00 a.m. in the center of Kosovo's capital, Prishtina, for a one-hour peaceful demonstration against the violence in Drenica. At 10:55 a.m., the police intervened with tear gas and water cannons, and began to beat the protesters. Local media report that at least two hundred people have sought medical attention for injuries sustained at the hands of the police, although the total number is still undetermined. A number of demonstrators were run over by police APCs, and at least four people were injured when a civilian car rammed into the crowds. Human Rights Watch has confirmed that the police beat a number of ethnic Albanian journalists, including Veton Surroi, editor-in-chief of the daily Koha Ditore, Ibrahim Osmani, journalist of AFP and the Voice of America, Avni Spahiu, editor-in-chief of the daily Bujku, Agron Bajrami, a journalist at Koha Ditore, and Sherif Kunjufca, a journalist with Albanian Television. Police forces broke into the offices of Koha Ditore and beat people who had taken refuge inside. Police officers forced photographer Fatos Berisha to jump from a second story window. Police also broke into the offices of the daily Bujku. Human Rights Watch unequivocally condemns the use of force in Prishtina on March 2 against those who had gathered peacefully to express discontent with the government's abusive and violent policies in Kosovo. Human Rights Watch is also deeply concerned by credible allegations that the security forces in Drenica may have targeted innocent civilians and performed extrajudicial executions. Human Rights Watch calls on the Yugoslav government to allow international observers into the Drenica region to determine the nature of the violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The government should also make public the names of all individuals who have been taken into custody and provide information about the charges made against them. Based on the Serbian police's use of torture against detainees in the past, there is reason to fear that those in detention may be subjected to physical abuse. Human Rights Watch urges the international community to undertake an immediate investigation into the Drenica events. In addition, Kosovo should be a primary focus of the newly-appointed Special Representative of the OSCE to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Felipe Gonzalez.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Human Rights Watch, the Greek Helsinki Monitor and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia understand that the two defendants plan to challenge the decision in Macedonia's supreme court. We call on that body to consider the numerous procedural violations in their first trial, portions of which were monitored by members of the Greek Helsinki Monitor and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia. If Mr. Osmani or Mr. Dauti are guilty of the charges brought against them, the court should prove it in a fair and open atmosphere, in which the defendants are guaranteed the constitutional right to a proper defense. Meto JovanovskiChairman Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia Panayote DimitrasSpokesman Greeek Helsinki Monitor Holly CartnerExecutive Director Europe and Central Asia Division, Human Rights Watch Background On January 27, 1997, the city councils in Tetovo and Gostivar, two predominantly ethnic Albanian towns in western Macedonia, voted to raise the Albanian and Turkish state flags next to the Macedonian state flag outside of the cities' town halls. The Macedonian Ministry of Interior informed the Tetovo and Gostivar governments that their decision was illegal, but the city councils refused to take the flags down. On May 21, the Macedonian constitutional court ruled that the city councils in Tetovo and Gostivar did not have the right to fly the Albanian or Turkish flags in front of their town halls. Both local governments refused to recognize the court's decision. Then, on July 8, around 11 p.m., parliament approved a new Law on the Use of Foreign Flags, which allowed state flags other than the Macedonian to be flown at any time on private property and in front of town halls on state holidays. Approximately four hours later, special police forces moved into Tetovo and Gostivar without warning, illegally detained some key members of the ruling ethnic Albanian party, including Mayor Osmani, took down the Albanian and Turkish flags, and ransacked parts of the Tetovo and Gostivar town halls. In violent clashes between the police and demonstrators later that day, more than 200 people, including seven policemen, were injured and three people died. The police used excessive force against individuals who were not offering any resistance, or who had ceased to resist, and illegally detained many people who had not participated in the demonstration. That same day, four ethnic Albanian officials from Gostivar and Tetovo were arrested. Alajdin Demiri, Mayor of Tetovo, Vehbi Bexheti, president of the Tetovo city council, and Refik Dauti, President of the Gostivar city council, were charged with disobeying a decision of the constitutional court, according to Article 377 of the penal code. Mayor Osmani, faced the same charge, plus organizing an armed resistance (Article 387 of the penal code) and inciting national, racial and religious hatred (Article 319 of the penal code). Osmani, who was the main organizer of the movement to raise the Albanian and Turkish flags, was held in pre-trial detention for sixty-three days. The court rejected the defendant's request to be released from custody, ignoring the defense's argument that, since Osmani had a family and substantial property, he was not likely to abscond. Dauti was released after thirty days in detention, while Demiri and Bexheti, who went on trial separately, were not detained at all. Originally scheduled to begin on September 1, the court granted Osmani and Dauti a nine-day postponement because they had not been provided all of the case material. The trial resumed on September 10, and was observed by the OSCE, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia, and the Greek Helsinki Monitor. The Gostivar court allowed numerous irregularities, denying the defendants their right to a fair trial. Most serious was the judge's repeated refusal to allow defense witnesses to testify. During the six-day trial, the prosecution was allowed to present six witnesses on its behalf, while the defense could not present any of its seven witnesses. Moreover, the judge limited consultations between the defendants and their lawyers. According to a report on the trial by the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia, """"the 'partnership' between the prosecution and the court against the defense left a bad impression of the impartiality of the court."""" On September 16, after the court refused to postpone the trial for one day, Osmani's legal team, Savo Kocarev, Nexhat Mehmeti and Machmut Jusufi, resigned in protest, stating that """"the court jeopardizes the defense's rights and does not allow us to prepare a proper defense."""" The court appointed a lawyer, but Osmani refused to have him to speak on his behalf. Regarding the accusation of inciting ethnic and racial hatred, the prosecution's case was based on statements Osmani made during a demonstration held in Gostivar on May 26, 1997. Based on video material shot secretly by the police, Osmani shouted slogans such as: """"We will give our lives, not our flag!"""" """"We will return a slap with a slap!"""" and """"Gostivar is an Albanian city!"""" Regarding the charge of organizing resistance, the prosecution presented a document called a """"Crisis Plan,"""" which police allegedly found in Osmani's office. The typed and unsigned document contained a written plan to defend the flags with armed groups in the event of police intervention. Osmani claimed that the document was not his, but the court refused the defense's request to have the document submitted for an expert analysis to help determine its authenticity. On September 17, the Gostivar court, with judge Jelena Kemeri presiding, found Refik Dauti guilty of disobeying a decision of the constitution court and sentenced him to the maximum punishment of three years in prison. Osmani was found guilty on all three charges, and was sentenced to 13 years, eight months in prison. Human rights groups and a number of political parties, including the ethnic Macedonian opposition party VMRO-DPMNE, condemned the verdict for its unusual harshness. Of particular concern was the eight-year sentence for violating Article 319 of the penal code, inciting ethnic and racial hatred. Osmani's conviction made apparent the arbitrary application of justice in Macedonia, since some highly xenophobic and anti-Albanian demonstrations held by ethnic Macedonians students in 1997 were never prosecuted. Human Rights Watch, the Greek Helsinki Monitor, and the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in the Republic of Macedonia are mainly concerned that Osmani and Dauti were denied their due process rights guaranteed under Macedonian and international law. Specifically, poor access to the case material, restricted lawyer consultations, and the court's refusal to accept witnesses on the behalf of the defense prohibited the defendants from obtaining a fair trial. On October 14, 1997, the Tetovo court found Alajdin Demiri and Vehbi Bexheti, the two ethnic Albanian officials from Tetovo, guilty of disobeying a decision of the constitutional court, and sentenced them each to two and a half years in prison. On January 14, 1998, a Skopje appeals court overturned the guilty verdict and returned the case back to the district court for review. On October 19, the Appellate Court in Skopje reduced Osmani's sentence from 13 years, 8 months to seven years. Dauti's sentence was reduced from three years to two years. Greek Helsinki Monitor P.O.

The organization also urged the Hague to resist expected pressure from Li to drop any resolution on China at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which convenes in Geneva on March 16.   """"Last year, Holland was a leading sponsor of a resolution on China at the Commission,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"China's overall human rights record has not significantly improved since then. And it is only the pressure of the annual U.N. debate that has persuaded the Chinese government to take some limited steps, such as its signing of a major human rights treaty last October. Holland should help to maintain that pressure,"""" she said. Human Rights Watch noted the decision by the European Union (EU) to hold a China-EU summit in early April at the time of the Asia-Europe (ASEM) summit in London, as well as Beijing's invitation to the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to visit China sometime in 1998. """"We welcome all efforts to engage China in dialogue on human rights, but if the dialogues are to be any more than pro forma talks, they have to be backed up by diplomatic pressure,"""" said Ms. Jones. """"It's also crucial that the integrity of the U.N. system be protected. If China uses its economic leverage to squelch any move to put a resolution forward, it undermines the notion of the Commission on Human Rights as a body which can look at the human rights practices of all U.N. members, regardless of political, strategic, or economic clout.""""  Last year, Beijing threatened to cancel trade deals with Holland and Denmark, another leading sponsor of a Geneva resolution, in retaliation for their rights criticism. A Dutch trade mission scheduled to go to China last June was postponed shortly after Beijing successfully lobbied to keep a critical measure from being debated or voted upon in Geneva.  Human Rights Watch urged Dutch officials to call on Premier Li to take specific steps to improve human rights, including ratification without major reservations of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. This is the treaty China signed last October, and only by ratifying it will China be obliged to legally respect its provisions. It should also sign and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; reform its draconian state security laws and abolish arbitrary administrative detention; take steps to protect the freedom of association of workers; and release significant numbers of prisoners detained for the peaceful expression of their political or religious beliefs. It should also ease restrictions on access to Tibet and Xinjiang by foreign journalists and human rights monitors. Human Rights Watch also criticized the European Union and the United States for the long delay in reaching a decision on a China resolution at the Commission, while Beijing is already lobbying key governments in an attempt to thwart any serious diplomatic effort in Geneva. At the General Affairs Council of the EU in Brussels on January 26, the EU foreign ministers agreed to put off a decision on the resolution until later this month.  On February 4, Sir Leon Brittan, European Trade Minister, in a speech in London, urged the EU to pursue dialogue with China on human rights instead of taking """"actions which register criticism and even condemnation,"""" failing to recognize that only the combination of concerted political pressure and engagement can effectively push China to make meaningful improvements.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

A copy of the letter is attached.  Friday, February 13, 1998 Assistant Secretary of State John Shattuck Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor Department of State Washington, DC Dear Secretary Shattuck: We write to you today concerning your upcoming visit to Turkey. Human Rights Watch welcomes your trip as an opportunity for the administration to expand its discussion with the government of Turkey concerning human rights and democratization. We are encouraged by your continued efforts to solicit views from the community of non-governmental organizations both in United States and Turkey and hope this letter advances your dialogue with the government of Turkey. The government of Prime Minister Mesut Ylmaz has spoken of 1998 as """"the year of law."""" To that end, the Justice Ministry has prepared a draft law of 522 provisions amending the Turkish Penal Code and recently submitted it to the Council of Ministers. Adopted in 1926, the Turkish Penal Code, though amended many times, is based on the Italian Criminal Code of 1889. Human Rights Watch is not currently in a position to comment on the draft law amending the Penal Code as a copy has not yet been made public. We do note that according to press reports the draft contains some positive developments, including abolition of the death penalty, increased punishments for officials convicted of using torture, and some easing of restrictions on free expression.  We urge you, however, to impress upon the government of Turkey the need to conduct much farther-reaching legal reform to target an array of laws that curtail free speech beyond the limits acceptable under international law. They include certain articles and provisions of the following laws: the Constitution; the Turkish Penal Code; the Press Law; the Political Parties Law; the Election Law; the Police Duty and Responsibility Law; the Anti-Terror Law; the Law concerning Crimes committed against Atatürk; the Provincial Administration Law; the law concerning founding and broadcasts of Television and Radio; and the Foreign Language Education and Teaching Law. The list is not exhaustive, but merely represents a compilation of the most egregious and actively used tools to repress free expression.  Human Rights Watch believes that increased freedom of thought represents a crucial area where Turkey must make progress. We believe that open debate unconstrained by fear of persecution or the need for self-censorship is a fundamental prerequisite for solving other problems, whether police abuse and torture or the conflict in southeastern Turkey. We realize the challenges Mr. Ylmaz's minority coalition government faces. We hope he is able to carry through with his efforts to improve human rights. Every state has a duty to maintain public order, and Turkey faces a legitimate security threat. But that responsibility must be seriously weighed against the right to express opinions and to peacefully argue for change within the democratic system. Unfortunately, the state has largely failed to achieve that delicate balance. Presently, the state of free expression in Turkey is a chaotic mix of freedom and repression. Earlier positive steps, such as legalizing private radio and television stations in 1993 or abolishing in 1991 a law forbidding the use of Kurdish (Law No. 2932) were either not followed up by further reform or were offset by other restrictions, some newly-imposed. Consequently, an arena of freedom where most issues can be discussed exists along side a danger zone where many who criticize accepted state policy about the role of Islam in politics and society, Turkey's ethnic Kurdish minority, the nature of the state, or the proper role of the military, face official sanction. Sometimes these two spheres collide, creating bizarre and contradictory situations. In 1997, for example, three journalists--two from the now defunct Kurdish nationalist newspaper Demokrasi and a reporter for the mainstream private television channel ATV--were arrested for interviewing two former PKK members. The two men, however, had earlier given statements without incident to other newspapers and to two popular television news programs. They even testified before a commission of the parliament of Turkey. Government repression of such critical views includes banning books and publications, pursuing criminal prosecution, closing newspapers and journals, denying journalists access to the conflict zone in southeastern Turkey and Northern Iraq, torturing and killing journalists from the radical and opposition press, and banning such political parties as the Islamist Welfare Party in 1997 and the Kurdish nationalist Democracy Party in 1994.  Changes in the legal system that do not address the most egregious manifestations of what some scholars refer to as the """"sacred state"""" (kutsal devlet) would amount to little more than a palliative and are unlikely to increase free expression. This concept is based on a strong, centralized state apparatus that punishes difference and criticism for the sake of creating a homogenized and idealized citizen and society. The mentality of the """"sacred state"""" is sown throughout Turkey's present constitution, written in the wake of the 1980 coup, and found in much of its legal framework, including the penal code. Many of these laws are either vague or, conversely, impose absolute prohibitions. Corporate bodies such as the judiciary or the army are given a """"moral personality"""" that under the law can be """"insulted."""" One statute, for example, criminalizes the creation of """"ethnic minorities."""" Some scholars may indeed argue that such a development model was appropriate seventy-five years ago, when the Republic of Turkey was founded, and certainly was not unique to Turkey. Such an entity, however, has little place in a world that enshrines individuals' rights in law and seeks to make government transparent to its citizens. Many in Turkish society--the vibrant private sector business community, a small but growing civil society, and numerous journalists, academics, and intellectuals--have outgrown the outdated and sclerotic legal framework of the """"sacred state."""" With each day they are pushing state-imposed limits on free expression and questioning restrictive practices. For example, a state security court prosecutor who publicly questioned the independence of the judiciary was himself charged and later acquitted. Mr. Yaar Kemal, Turkey's most famous living writer, was charged under the 1991 Anti-Terror Law for an article critical of the state's policy on the Kurdish minority that appeared in the German weekly Der Spiegel. Mr. Eber Yamurdereli, a respected lawyer and human rights activist, was convicted on free expression charges, briefly imprisoned, then released by a local prosecutor as anger in society mounted. It now appears he may be reimprisoned. In an effort to challenge restrictive press laws, a group of leading intellectuals, writers, and actors released a pamphlet, """"Freedom of Thought-2!"""" (Düünceye Özgrlk-2!), in order to precipitate a court case against  themselves. Over one thousand intellectuals conducted a similar act of civil disobedience two years ago. TSAD (Turkish Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association), a business group of over 400 of Turkey's largest companies, has called for an overhaul of the legal system to create a """"transparent, individual-centered"""" state. Recent films, such as Reis Çelik's Let there be Light (Iklar Snmesin), a frank account of the conflict in southeastern Turkey, or the depiction of police torture in Mustafa Altoklar's Heavy Novel (Ar Roman), have also expanded boundaries.  We attach in the appendix to this letter excerpts from laws and decrees enumerated earlier that Human Rights Watch believes must be amended or abolished to remove restrictions on free expression that violate international standards. We hope you will share this list with all of your interlocutors during your trip. We also believe that Turkish society in its entirety must actively participate in the debate on reforming the Penal Code. We were thus heartened when the State Minister for Human Rights, Mr. Hikmet Sami Türk, called for academic, professional, and scientific communities to conduct a public debate on reforming the Penal Code. We hope you will be able to advance this discussion and wish you success in your endeavors in Turkey.

Human Rights Watch also commends the Dayton signatories for progress on some longstanding issues, such as the distribution of common license plates. Freedom of movement for all citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be greatly enhanced through the realization of this long-awaited decision. Given your stated commitment to resolve other problems which have blocked implementation of the peace agreement, Human Rights Watch would like to take the opportunity of your presence in the United States to raise several questions. Human Rights Watch believes that your new position as Prime Minister for the Republika Srpska, combined with the political and financial support you have received and have been promised from the international community, provides a critical opportunity for you and your government to demonstrate in concrete and immediate ways your desire to bring about improvements in the human rights situation. We'd like to raise two sets of issues: first, several matters which we believe could be addressed without delay, given your and President Biljana Plavsic's influence in the Banja Luka area; and second, longer-term human rights issues in the Republika Srpska. The following serious matters need your urgent attention: Restitution of property. A number of Bosniak and Croat families, who were evicted from their homes in Banja Luka after the signing of the Dayton agreement, have not had their rightful property reinstated to them. In some cases, a local court has even recognized them as the rightful owners and ordered the reinstatement of their property. Some families have made repeated attempts to return to their homes but were prevented from doing so by hostile neighbors -- even as the Banja Luka police stood by and refused to intervene. In one case, a man made ten unsuccessful attempts to regain his property. While Human Rights Watch commends the Banja Luka authorities on the progress made in some of these cases recently, some 10 families with court-ordered reinstatement continue to await justice. Several hundred other families have been frustrated by the slow pace of decision-making in their cases. The court in Banja Luka has been instructed to turn over pending and new cases to the Ministry of Refugees, but few cases have been resolved by the Ministry, and it appears that taking these cases out of the hands of the court has further obstructed the process. What steps will your government undertake to ensure that these families will receive timely and fair decisions, many having waited months and even years for a decision?  The Matanovic case. In the fall of 1995, Bosnian Serb police in Prijedor """"disappeared"""" Father Tomislav Matanovic, a Roman Catholic priest from Banja Luka, and his elderly parents. Later, the Republika Srpska (RS) authorities made an offer to exchange Father Matanovic for Serb prisoners in the Federation. The Human Rights Chamber, established by the Dayton agreement, having heard the facts of the case in a full hearing, determined that Father Matanovic and his parents were victims of forced disappearance and ordered the RS government to immediately reveal his and his parents' whereabouts or fate by October 6, 1997. The RS government failed to comply with this order. We believe that the following individuals have direct knowledge of the case and the whereabouts of the Matanovic family: Srdjo Srdjic (head of the Prijedor Red Cross and previously President of the Prijedor Municipality), Momcilo Radanovic, Gojko Klikovic, Mr. Pecancac and Mr. Krnjajic (of the Public Security department in Banja Luka), Ranko Jakovljevic (commander of the Urije police station), and Prijedor police officer Milan Rodic (who guarded the family while it was under house arrest). We believe General Pero Colic may also have knowledge of the family's fate. Although there have been allegations that the brothers of a Bosnian Serb army Major Radovan Lakic (killed in the war) were involved in holding the Matanovic family, it was clear to the Human Rights Chamber and to Human Rights Watch, which conducted inquiries into the case, that the RS authorities have knowledge of and are responsible for the fate of the family members. Are you willing to arrest and prosecute those members of the Prijedor police, including Ranko Jakovljevic, commander of the Urije police station? What other steps will you take immediately to ensure the release of Father Matanovic and his parents?  The Kovacevic case. Hasan Kovacevic was murdered while in police custody in a Banja Luka police station on 31 July 1996. An autopsy report, obtained by Human Rights Watch, revealed that Kovacevic had 16 broken ribs (some broken twice) and died due to massive internal bleeding. The police claimed he sustained these injuries jumping out a first floor window. A pathologist who examined his body concluded that the police explanation was inconsistent with the injuries, but only mild disciplinary action was taken against the police officers involved. To date, no full public disclosure of the facts of the case has been made and to our knowledge, no one has been prosecuted for homicide. What steps will you take to ensure that the police officers involved are held accountable for this act?  Police brutality in Teslic. There have been two recent cases of beatings of non-Serbs in police custody in the town of Teslic. In both cases, an SFOR doctor examined the individuals and determined that their injuries were consistent with their allegations of abuse at the hands of the police. These beatings are alarming in that they indicate a return to the serious abuses of human rights which dominated the period following the Dayton agreement in Teslic but which had recently improved. What will you do to ensure that such beatings stop and that the perpetrators are held responsible? What is your policy toward police officers who behave in this manner?  Business targets. Human Rights Watch has received information indicating that a number of directors of major, financially solvent business concerns in the Banja Luka area have been recently dismissed due to their political affiliation. Can you assure us that the removals have been carried out in accordance with local law and international human rights standards?  In the second category, there are several other broader issues which also must be addressed in the interest of human rights and implementation of the Dayton agreement.  Over the last couple of weeks, you have expressed your willingness to cooperate in the return of Croat and Bosniak refugees and displaced persons to the Republika Srpska. In October, an international human rights observer in Banja Luka told The New York Times that there had not been any changes in refugee return issues since Mrs. Plavsic took over the government. What steps is your government now prepared to take to ensure the right to return of those who were forcibly expelled and whose property was confiscated during the war? A first step to facilitate the return process would be the immediate repeal of discriminatory housing laws issued during and right after the war, and acceptance and implementation of housing laws proposed to the Republika Srpska by the Office of the High Representative. Do you anticipate your government will make this change, and if so, when might we anticipate it? Although some persons indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) might be urged into surrendering themselves, it is unlikely that all or even most will. The arrest of indicted persons is long overdue, yet the Republika Srpska has so far not arrested any indictee. What concrete steps is your government planning to take in order to ensure the arrest of persons indicted for war crimes by the ICTY? A first step, and concrete proof of your willingness to cooperate would be the immediate extradition of Zoran Zigic, who, according to the latest information available to us, is serving time in the Banja Luka prison for murder.  In recent interviews, you admitted that your government does not yet have complete control over all law enforcement agencies on the territory of the Republika Srpska. What steps will you take to bring all police units and other law enforcement agencies under government control? Human Rights Watch urges you to immediately share with the International Police Task Force all available information on the size, composition and organizational and control structure of all regular, special, secret and paramilitary police forces in the Republika Srpska. Finally, Human Rights Watch would like to express its grave concern over the selection of some of the members of your cabinet. In particular, Human Rights Watch regrets the appointment of Petko Cancar, former mayor of Foca/Srbinje, as Minister of Justice. Cancar is allegedly responsible for organizing the ethnic cleansing in the Foca region. Likewise, the appointment of General Momir Talic as head of the RS Army is unacceptable given his military command responsibility in the Bosnanska Krajina region during widespread, serious and protracted violations of international humanitarian law in that area, of which he was fully aware. The presence of persons allegedly responsible for war crimes in positions of power is a major obstacle to peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and greatly hinders the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes of origin. We look forward to your responses to these questions, and hope for new cooperation from the RS authorities in the interest of human rights issues.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/02/15/hrw-condemns-attempts-restrict-independent-media-federal-republic-yugoslavia-fry","HRW Condemns Attempts to Restrict the Independent Media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia FRY","HRW Condemns Attempts to Restrict the Independent Media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY)","OPEN LETTER","02/15/1998","Human Rights Watch, the largest U.S.-based human rights organization, condemns your government's ongoing attempts to restrict the independent media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).  The open bid for temporary radio and television frequencies, announced on February 6, only complicates the matter. Like the laws regulating the electronic media, the legal procedures for the open bid are confusing, inconsistent, and in contradiction with other Serbian and Yugoslav laws. For example, only companies that are registered with the Ministry of Information and the Commercial Court may submit a bid. But this requirement contradicts Serbian law since, according to the Law on Radio Television, a company first needs a frequency in order to register with these bodies. The cost of participating in the bid, the technical conditions required, and the documents needed from other government-run agencies are insurmountable barriers for the private radio and television stations that exist in FRY. Human Rights Watch views the most recent open bid as a continuation of the government's policy to deny, through complicated and unduly burdensome legal procedures, frequencies to those radio and television stations that do not conform to the state's narrow definition of """"acceptable information."""" These stations are allowed to operate, thereby demonstrating to the international community an apparent respect for free speech. But, as the past has demonstrated, the government may close down a private radio or television station without a licence at any time. An estimated 300 private radio stations and 100 private television stations in FRY are currently in this precarious position. In contrast, government-run stations or commercial stations with close ties to the government, like Radio Kosava or BKTV, have consistently obtained licences and are free to broadcast without interference. In mid-1997, for example, the government closed seventy-seven independent, opposition-run or commercial television and radio stations on the basis that they were """"illegal."""" Many of the stations did not posses the proper licenses, in fact because the government consistently refused to grant licenses to stations that broadcast critical views of the state. Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the FRY government to: To prepare new media laws and regulations, in full consultation with the independent media in Yugoslavia, that guarantee freedom of expression in television and radio. Concrete changes in the Serbian Law on Radio Television, the Serbian Law on Communication Systems, the Serbian Laws on Public Information, the Federal Law on Communication Systems, and the Federal Law on Public Information should guarantee that broadcast licenses are distributed and regulated by an independent body without regard to political considerations. Until a new series of federal and republican laws are introduced, permit all currently licensed, and all unlicensed but currently operating, radio and television stations to broadcast without interference. No regulation of the airwaves should take place until Yugoslavia has a new set of media laws and regulations that guarantee free expression in accordance with international standards. Consult with the independent media and its organizations, such as the Association of Independent Electronic Media (ANEM), on a regular basis about ways to protect and promote the independent media.  Human Rights Watch will continue to monitor the development of FRY's media legislation and its application. We note that freedom of the media is a fundamental requirement for lifting the outer wall of sanctions currently in place against FRY and reintegrating the country into the international community. Yours, Holly Cartner Executive Director Europe and Central Asia Division cc: Richard Miles, United States Embassy in Belgrade Robert Gelbard, U.S. Special Envoy to the Balkans Bronislav Geremek, OSCE Chairman-in-Office Robin Cook, E.U. Council of Ministers U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in the former Yugoslavia Human Rights Watch Background The Electronic Media in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia The broadcast media in Serbia is regulated by five laws: the Serbian Law on Radio and Television, the Laws on Connection Systems (Serbian and federal), and the Laws on Public Information (Serbian and federal). In addition, a number of state bodies are involved in regulation, including the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications, the Ministry of Information and the commercial courts. Many of the relevant laws and regulations are contradictory and allow the government to grant or deny licenses to those stations it desires. For example, under current regulations, the Yugoslav Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications requires applicants for a broadcast license to provide proof that the station has been registered as a public media outlet at the Ministry of Information and at the appropriate commercial court. But these documents cannot be obtained without first having a license from the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications. Even taken individually, Serbia's broadcast laws do not guarantee that licenses will be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis. Article 5 of Serbia's Law on Radio and Television gives the government a very broad discretional right to grant licenses, while article 10 (6) of the same law allows the government to revoke licenses under vague terms. Article 7 of the law obliges the government to hold an open auction for frequencies once a year, but the last auction was held in 1994. As a result, since 1989 independent radio and television stations (like Radio B-92 or Radio Boom 93) have been repeatedly denied a license without an explanation even though they apparently met all of the criteria, while stations that were either blatantly pro-Milosevic or, at least, commercial and wholly uncritical (like RTV Pink or BK TV) easily obtained licenses for large parts of Serbia. The most extreme example was Radio Kosava, run by Milosevic's daughter, Marija, which obtained a frequency by government decree without even submitting an application. The independent broadcast media was, therefore, severely limited in its effectiveness, leaving the state controlled television and radio to disseminate government propaganda unchallenged, as in the past. Many people in Serbia and abroad blame the state media for encouraging the war in former Yugoslavia by distorting facts and promoting xenophobic, extreme nationalist views. Despite these barriers, Serbia's independent radio and television stations played an important role during the 1996-97 demonstrations by disseminating information, often directly from the streets, that offered an alternative to government propaganda. Unlike during the war, which was never fought inside Serbia, audiences could contrast the state media's coverage with their daily experiences at home. The daily audience of the larger stations, specifically Radio B-92 and Radio Index in Belgrade, rose to over one million. Smaller stations throughout Serbia rebroadcast B-92's transmission, thus providing many people in the countryside with an alternative to the state-run media, which was misrepresenting the purpose and scale of the demonstrations. In acknowledgment of their effectiveness, the government attempted to ban or close a large number of radio stations, including Radio B-92 itself, which responded by sending daily news over the Internet. Most often, the state justified the closures by claiming that the station in question did not have the proper license to broadcast. In most cases, this was true, a consequence in large part of the government's persistent refusal to grant such licenses to independent radio or television stations. Many of the stations that were closed following the November 1996 elections, all of them either independent or oppositional, had been operating without interference for the past three or more years, suggesting that they were closed strictly for political reasons. In May 1997, the Serbian Minister of Information, Radmila Milentijevic, promised that there would be democratic reform in the electronic media and that no private television or radio station would be shut down before the September 21 elections. Despite this, on June 2, the Yugoslav Minister for Transport and Telecommunications, Dojcilo Radojevic, announced the need to """"establish order in the broadcast media."""" All """"pirate"""" radio and television stations, he declared, would be permanently banned if they failed to apply for a temporary broadcast license by June 30, 1997. However, the ministry did not clarify which documents were required to apply for a temporary license or on what criteria applications would be considered. According to journalists and the Association of Independent Broadcast Media, a local network of independent radio and television stations, the procedure at that time for submitting the application was confusing and contradictory. Shortly after the June 30 deadline, and in some cases before the deadline, the government initiated a coordinated campaign among the Ministry of Transport and Telecommunications, the criminal police, the financial police and various government agencies to shut down more than seventy-five radio and television stations across Serbia and confiscate some of their equipment without warning, even though some of the stations had submitted all of the necessary documentation. All of the closed stations were either independent, run by the opposition or commercial and unconnected to the government. On February 6, the government announced another open bid for temporary radio and television frequencies, even though it had never replied to the bids submitted in June 1997. To apply for a bid, stations must meet a number of criteria, such as be registered at the Ministry of Information and Commercial Court, have the proper licences for electronics and construction, and provide an as-yet undisclosed fee. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Related Sites Following are links for additional information about the media in FRY.

A copy of the letter is attached. February 10, 1998 His Excellency Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan al Bashir President of the Republic of Sudan Khartoum, Sudan Fax 249-11-771-724 Your Excellency: We write to you to express concern about recent developments in Sudan, and to seek your government's comments on the situation. We understand that there have been a number of arrests of advocates who have engaged in criticism of the government. They include attorneys arrested in late December and early January after a protest at the court house in Khartoum on December 20, 1997. Many of these advocates are said to be held in incommunicado detention, without trial. We consider that detention of such persons without charges for this length of time is prolonged arbitrary detention, in violation of international human rights standards. To the best of our knowledge, these advocates include (but are not limited to) Yahya El Hussain, Kamal Abdulrachman, Nasir al Din al Said, Ali Adam, and Al Rashid Ali Omer (of Kosti). We request that they be charged immediately and given a fair hearing (not in a public order court), or released. We object to any trials of government opponents in public order courts, which by their nature violate the right to a fair trial. There is a marked increase in the use of these very summary courts to punish government opponents who seek to exercise their free expression and free association rights. Use of the public order courts to impose long jail terms, flog and fine persons exercising their rights makes a travesty of justice, even if the convictions are ultimately overturned on appeal. We urge your government to cease using public order courts to try such cases. We understand that Ghazi Suleiman, who was arrested on January 20, 1998, was subjected to two weeks in detention after a summary trial in a public order court, and is now free, having had his conviction and five-month sentence overturned by the appellate court. It appears to us that he was being punished for his exercise of his rights to free expression and free association, and for his activities as a defense advocate for unpopular defendants. He headed the opposition slate in the December 1997 bar association elections, and charged that the government engaged in fraud in those elections, among other things. We therefore request that Ghazi Suleiman be compensated for the time he has spent in jail, and that fees and expenses he incurred as a result of the trial and sentence be reimbursed to him. We further request that your government investigate the public order court judge who tried him and, if appropriate, remove him from the bench. We make the same requests with regard to all public order court defendants and trials we have mentioned in our letters to your government in 1997 and 1998. We have received reports that Samira Karrar and Nafisa El Milaik, relatives of some of the twenty-eight officers summarily executed in 1990, were detained in late January 1998 en route to a meeting of these families, accused of possessing antigovernment material and disturbing public order, and tried by a public order court. This group of families yearly commemorates the officers' deaths by petitioning the government for return of the bodies, among other things. We consider these arrests to be a continuation of the persecution the families have suffered for asserting their human rights. We have received reports that Sheikh Abdel Mahmoud Abbo Ibrahiem, secretary general of the Ansar Organizational Affairs, was detained by Sudan Security after giving a sermon in the Al Ansar Mosque in Omdurman at the end of Ramadan in late January. His sermon was critical of the government and it appears that his detention and trial were in retaliation for his exercise of his rights. He is said to have been tried at night without an advocate and without the knowledge of any colleague or family member, in an unfurnished home in the Abu Seid district north of Omdurman, presumably by a public order judge. Sheikh Abdel Mahmoud Abbo is said to be serving a five month sentence and to have been fined 500,000 Sudanese pounds. His case is on appeal; indeed, his appellate advocate is Ghazi Suleiman. We urge that the conviction be voided and the defendant be appropriately compensated. After Sheikh Abdel Mahmoud Abbo's detention, his colleague Mohamed El Mahdi Hassan gave the same sermon in the same mosque and was arrested by Sudan Security. It is unclear if he has been tried or is in Sudan Security detention; he was held in a """"ghost house"""" and mistreated a few years ago, so his exact whereabouts and treatment are of great concern. We understand that on December 31, 1997, your government confiscated the Catholic Club, formerly used by that church as a study and recreation center, and that Sudan Security forces occupied the premises in early February. We are concerned about this development and we would like to know the reasons for this treatment of a religious institution. We are gratified to learn that your government is now permitting the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC) to recommence its programs in Sudan, most of which were suspended in late 1996 after Cmdr. Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, then an ally of your government, held ICRC staff, patients and plane hostage. We hope that the ICRC can now begin its work of visiting in your detention centers and prisons captured combatants and others held in connection with the conflict. We are particularly concerned about the fate of five Umma Party combatants captured on December 8, 1997, near Kassala, Bass Mustafa, Abdulhadi Ahmed Eikhidir, Alkhair Alsadig Hassan Musa Alsegaler, and Omar Ali Mohamed. We hope that by now the ICRC has been able to visit them. We reiterate our concern about the threatened use of the cruel and inhuman penalty of cross amputation in this case, and we would like to know the status of their case. We earlier expressed our concern about the trial that started in November 1997 of fifteen defendants (two in absentia) on conspiracy and other charges that carry the death penalty. We have learned that the court finally secured the transfer to Kober Prison of the thirteen defendants from Sudan Security custody, where they had spent the first weeks of trial, unable to communicate with their advocates. We are gratified to see that this situation of incommunicado detention during trial was finally corrected. We would be interested in learning from your government if those in Sudan Security who are responsible for holding the defendants in Security custody after the commencement of the trial, and for several weeks after the court's order to transfer them out of Security custody, were investigated, disciplined or punished in any way. We feel that it is extremely important to hold all Sudan Security officials to the rule of law, and punish those who violate the rules of their public office. We reiterate our firm opposition to several aspects of that trial: trial in absentia, use of testimony secured after torture, and the death penalty. As to trial in absentia, we regard that as a denial of every standard of fair trial. Where defendants have not been detained, the proper procedure would be to hold their trial in abeyance until they are brought into custody. We believe that testimony secured after torture should not be used in evidence, in order to deter security agents from further torture and to assure that justice is done. As to the death penalty, we note that your government is not obliged to seek the death penalty but instead may ask for a lesser penalty. We urge that prosecutorial discretion be exercised in this case and all others.  We are quite concerned about press reports that, since your government came to power in 1989, some 100 persons have been sentenced to death and executed. Even taking into account the fact that more than one-fourth of this number (twenty-eight army officers) were executed in 1990 as the result of a coup attempt, that number is still much higher than we had been led to believe in interviews with government officials. The most urgent case is now the case of Abd al HalimAbd al Raziq, a member of a religious sect which believes that all others are infidels. He was convicted of murder following his participation in an attack on an Ansar al Sunna mosque in Wad Medani in September 1997 in which two people were killed. Appeals have run out and he faces imminent execution. We ask that he not be executed. With regard to the war, we note that there has been heavy fighting in and around Wau. We are concerned that your government, according to the United Nations, has not permitted free access to civilians displaced by the fighting; they are said to number between 100,000 and 150,000, and are in immediate need of food and other assistance. We urge you to grant immediate access to the United Nations and its partners for humanitarian relief purposes.  Recalling the events of Juba in June and July 1992, we also urge your government to use caution when dealing with those suspected of involvement with rebel forces in and around Wau, and to instruct all military and security forces to refrain from retaliation against suspects. In particular, if arrests are to be made, care should be exercised to assure that all detainees (whether civilian or military) are registered immediately and that their families and their religious, relief and other organizations be given immediate access to them.  Thank you for your attention to these matters. We look forward to your government's response. Sincerely, /s/ Jemera Rone Counsel","Africa, Sudan","Detention without Trial"

On the evening of Thursday, February 12, 1998, some sixty soldiers and policemen stormed the Kinshasa residence of Etienne Tshisekedi, leader of the opposition Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), and arrested him and his guards. Other troops surrounded the UDPS' headquarters and its secretary general's home in the same neighborhood. As the news spread and supporters converged on the area, soldiers dispersed and arrested up to twenty of them. In a blatant effort to cover up this latest instance of assault on internationally recognized democratic freedoms, the DRC's Minister of Agriculture told a hurriedly convened press conference on February 13 that the government has sent Mr. Tshisekedi to his native village in Kasai province to allow him an opportunity to lead local reconstruction and food security efforts there.  This assault occurred hardly two days after the DRC government officially declined to meet with the Reverend Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for democracy in Africa, and blamed him for having met with opposition figures including Tshisekedi and other leaders of the civil society.  Attacks on leaders of the democratic opposition have grown more frequently recently. For example, police arrested ten journalists on November 28, 1997, for having attended a press conference by opposition leader Z'Ahidi Ngoma. The ten were taken to a military compound in Kinshasa where they were undressed and given twenty to forty lashes each. Ngoma himself, founder of the opposition group Forces of the Future, was arrested and in early February, he was transferred to Lubumbashi, the capital of Katanga region. On the same airplane with Ngoma was Joseph Olengankoy, another opposition leader arrested in Kinshasa. The move seemed intended to keep both men away from their support base in the capital. In December 1997, soldiers occupied the Kinshasa daily Elima and pillaged its property; in early January 1998, troops occupied and ransacked the offices of Le Moniteur de L'Economie, a business weekly.  Yesterday, authorities granted a temporary release to Roger Sala Nzo Badila and Nyabirungu Mwene Songa, respectively secretary and chairman of the Kinshasa-based National Center for Human Rights. They had spent nearly three months in pretrial detention, and still face charges of endangering state security for publishing a report criticizing the human rights record of the DRC government.  Finally, as if the threat of prolonged arbitrary detention, beatings and destruction of property was not sufficient to silence dissent, President Kabila and his minister of interior took the added precaution in mid-January of threatening to try whoever challenges the ban on political activities before a military court. On January 23, a military court jailed two opposition politicians, Professor Mathieu Kalele and Jean-Francois Kabanda, who are leading members of the UDPS, for two years on charges of spreading seditious rumors.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that denying political space to the opposition, the press and civil society will only increase tensions within the Congolese society and create a negative environment where uncontrolled violence could explode.  Human Rights Watch calls on the Congolese government to immediately release Etienne Tshisekedi and all other political detainees. We call on the government to guarantee the full respect of human rights and fundamental liberties, taking concrete steps in this regard to establish an independent judiciary; end the trial of civilians bef military courts; institute safeguards against torture and ill-treatment, including by bringing all detainees before a judicial authority without delay; ending routine incommunicado detention; and providing for prompt and regular access to detainees by relatives, doctors and lawyers. We also call on the government to lift the ban on political activities, respect freedom of expression, and uphold the right to peaceful assembly. The government of the DRC should recognize the rights of human rights defenders in the country to monitor, investigate, and speak out on human rights concerns and to associate freely with others nationally and internationally in the promotion and protection of human rights.  Human Rights Watch urges all members of the international community to make bilateral and multilateral assistance to the central government of the Congo contingent upon the government's meeting a series of calibrated benchmarks over time. Minimum conditions for international aid to the government should be: demonstrable and tangible progress in the investigation of reported civilian massacres in the DRC during episodes f its recent history and improved respect for the rule of law, human rights, and democratic principles by the Congolese government.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

The rioting appears to have been largely spontaneous, but Human Rights Watch believes that senior government and military officials have fueled anti-Chinese sentiment through veiled references to """"rats"""" and """"traitors"""" and by their failure to explain that high prices and food shortages are not the fault of individual retailers. Human Rights Watch calls on the government to state explicitly that the ethnic Chinese are a valued and important part of Indonesian society and that violence against them and their property will not be tolerated. Denouncing communal violence in generic terms is not enough. The government should cease immediately the harassment of two prominent members of the ethnic Chinese community, Jusuf and Sofyan Wanandi. Finally, it needs to begin immediately a longer-term effort to end the discrimination against the ethnic Chinese in Indonesia that has existed since the late 1950s. In a commentary in the February 3, 1998 edition of the Asian Wall Street Journal, Indonesia expert Adam Schwarz suggested that President Soeharto take the lead by including an ethnic Chinese in his next cabinet. The government would do well to take that suggestion to heart. Over the last two months, violence against ethnic Chinese has erupted across the country. After a series of outbreaks in Java, the unrest had by mid-February hit the islands of Sumatra, Sulawesi, Lombok, Sumbawa, and Flores as well. In most cases, the protests have been related to sharp increases in the prices of the so-called nine basic commodities (among them rice, wheat flour, cooking oil, sugar, soybeans, and eggs) as a result of the dramatic loss in value of the rupiah, the Indonesian currency. The targets of the violence have been Chinese-owned shops, homes, and businesses. In none of the dozens of outbreaks of violence chronicled in this report has there been evidence of direct government instigation of the rioters, and the government has been quick to send troops to disturbed areas and arrest alleged ringleaders. Nevertheless, some senior officials have appeared to endorse the anti-Chinese sentiment. Not only have they expressed no sympathy for the victims or made any effort to explain to the public the causes and consequences of the economic crisis, but in some cases, they have tried to deflect blame for the economic crisis onto prominent members of the ethnic Chinese community. On January 14, for example, the commander of the armed forces in a press conference called on the owners of thirteen large conglomerates to bring their dollars back from abroad and convert them to rupiah.(1) Nowhere was the word """"Chinese"""" mentioned, but the appeal was an implicit accusation that wealthy Chinese were contributing to the currency crisis by selfishly keeping dollars stashed abroad at a time when the rupiah needed bolstering. In late January, Lt.Gen. Syarwan Hamid was reported to have made pointed references to the ethnic Chinese as """"rats"""" who have no sense of patriotism and who at a time of crisis are salting away """"the fruits of our national development.""""(2) President Soeharto's son-in-law, Maj. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, then head of the army Special Forces (Kopassus) and since promoted to commander of the Strategic Reserve (Kostrad, the army's most elite unit), attended a much-publicized breaking of the Ramadan fast with Muslim leaders on January 23 during which he blamed the crisis on a political conspiracy, and others attending explicitly linked the conspirators to """"the conglomerate group"""" and those with their """"henchmen operating overseas.""""(3) The two phrases were clear references to the ethnic Chinese, and Prabowo, instead of distancing himself from the remarks, tacitly endorsed them, urging a united front between the army and Islam. By warning over and over that the draconian anti-subversion law would be applied to hoarders of basic goods without at the same time explaining the difficulties that many shopkeepers are facing, the army has helped generate suspicions that any shop owner who refuses to sell at pre-crisis prices, or who closes his or her shop for fear of violence, is deliberately making goods scarce to keep prices high. The most obvious example of high-level attempts to focus the spotlight on the ethnic Chinese has been the army's targeting of prominent businessman Sofyan Wanandi, in an incident described more fully below. Veiled and not-so-veiled attacks on the patriotism of the ethnic Chinese have a long history in Indonesia, going back to the Chinese role in the Dutch colonial period and to the 1960s and the army's suspicion that the ethnic Chinese as a group were a fifth column for the Chinese Communist Party. The attacks then were as unfair as they are now, but for reasons that will be explained below, they resonate strongly in Indonesian society, especially, though not exclusively, among more conservative Muslim groups. The Soeharto government has continued a policy of discrimination against the ethnic Chinese, restricting their admission to state universities and the civil service and maintaining a ban on the use of Chinese characters, while at the same time, leaving their dominance of the Indonesian economy intact and enabling a few dozen ethnic Chinese families to amass fabulous wealth. These policies have resulted in a public image of the ethnic Chinese as rich pariahs. The irony is that with the exception of the Wanandi brothers, the main victims of this round of unrest are not members of the estimated forty extremely wealthy families whose heads have earned the appellation cukong, or tycoon, but the shopkeepers who constitute a critical part of Indonesia's middle class.","Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Bahamas, Indonesia, Austria","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Security Council yesterday, Human Rights Watch called for reactivating a commission to investigate arms flows to Rwanda, and extending the commission's mandate to include Burundi. The International Commission of Inquiry into arms trafficking to the former Rwandan government and allied militias, known as UNICOI, was established in September 1995 in the wake of revelations, published by Human Rights Watch, about the role of states and private traffickers in arming the perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide. In its one-year life, the commission prepared three reports, the final one of which was submitted to the U.N. Secretary-General in October 1996 but only released in January 1998, more than a year later. That report showed the extent of international involvement in the proliferation of arms in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, and--by extension--governments' complicity in the serious abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law that have taken place there. An addendum to the report, which was released on January 26, sheds further light on arms deliveries to the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide, naming the government of the Seychelles, a member of the former Rwandan government who is currently awaiting trial before the International Criminal Tribunal in Arusha, a South African arms broker, and the Banque Nationale de Paris as being implicated in one possible violation of the Rwanda arms embargo. In its own research on Burundi, Human Rights Watch has exposed how international actors have continued to provide weapons to both the government and rebel forces, thereby compounding the killings and mass displacement of civilians that have characterized the civil war. We have therefore called repeatedly for an arms embargo on both sides of the war, and for the extension of UNICOI's mandate to include Burundi, in partial response to the tragic humanitarian crisis in the region. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights in Burundi, Paulo Sérgio Pinheiro, has likewise drawn attention to the problem of arms proliferation in the Great Lakes region, calling urgently for an arms embargo on the two sides in Burundi. In December 1997, the European Parliament passed a resolution that also called for an arms embargo on the two sides, and for UNICOI to resume its work in the region and investigate arms flows into Burundi and to Burundian citizens in neighboring states. In light of the highly worrisome situation in the Great Lakes region, including Rwanda, Burundi and eastern Congo, where hundreds of thousands of civilians continue to be at risk of violent attack, Human Rights Watch calls on the Security Council to: -Impose an arms embargo on both sides of the war in Burundi, and devise mechanisms to ensure the embargo's effective implementation and enforcement. -Reactivate the International Commission of Inquiry (UNICOI). -Extend UNICOI's mandate to include both sides in the civil war in Burundi.","Africa, Burundi, Rwanda","Arms, United Nations"

Sincerely, Kenneth Roth Executive Director -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- January 29, 1998 President William J. Clinton The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W. Washington, D.C. 20500 Dear President Clinton: As the international community observes the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and we recall the leading role of the United States in helping to draft this important document, we note that the United States remains disappointingly reluctant to assess its own conduct under international human rights standards. As a coalition of U.S.-based international human rights and domestic civil rights groups, we are writing to request that your administration compile and publish an annual report on the state of human rights in the United States to demonstrate the government's commitment in practice to international human rights norms. Such a report would enable the American public to gauge compliance with international human rights treaties ratified by the United States. To date, no such report exists. As you know, the State Department's Bureau on Democracy, Human Rights and Labor will issue its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices this week. Those reports have improved over the past several years, and their high quality points up the absence of a similar report dedicated to human rights practices in the United States.  In making this request, we do not seek a report that merely cites legal protections in these areas, as was provided in the July 1994 report on compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Instead, like the State Department's country reports on human rights, we seek an honest appraisal of how, in practice, rights are protected. We believe that such a report would assist policymakers in identifying trends in violations, provide the public with information about efforts to hold abusers accountable, and submit our government to the same scrutiny that the U.S. applies to other governments in its annual country reports on human rights. We urge you to instruct the relevant departments to compile and publish this report annually, beginning next year.  We look forward to a chance to discuss this proposal in more detail, at your convenience.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/01/23/european-union-should-endorse-china-resolution","European Union Should Endorse China Resolution","European Union Should Endorse China Resolution","","01/23/1998","Foreign ministers of the European Union (EU) should endorse a resolution on China at the upcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Human Rights Watch said today. The ministers are gathering in Brussels for an EU General Affairs meeting on January 26-27. Both the EU and the U.S. government are engaged in high-level discussions on whether to push a China motion this year. At the Commission's 1997 session, China mounted a successful campaign to block consideration of a resolution, threatening trade retaliation against European and other governments. """"It is the pressure of the annual U.N. debate that has pushed Beijing to take some limited initiatives on human rights thus far,"""" said Lotte Leicht, director of the Human Rights Watch Brussels office. """"But given the scale of abuses, it would be a mistake to remove that pressure before China takes concrete steps to comply with international standards."""" Ms. Leicht welcomed Beijing's invitation to the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, to visit China, but warned that her visit could be used to undermine the credibility of the U.N. system for monitoring human rights. """"It would be dangerous to the integrity of the Commission to give the impression that resolutions on abusive countries can be traded away for cooperation with high level delegations or visits by U.N. officials. Whether or not a China resolution is considered by the Commission should depend solely on Beijing's human rights record, which has not significantly improved."""" The invitation to Mrs. Robinson was announced during talks by British Foreign Minister Robin Cook in Beijing earlier this week, clearly aimed at influencing the EU's decision on whether to sponsor a resolution at the Commission which convenes on March 16. (Great Britain is currently in the EU presidency.) A similar invitation had been extended to her predecessor, Jose Ayala Lasso, in the run up to last year's Commission meeting. China has made other recent moves to try to undercut any support for a debate in Geneva. It agreed to hold the third session in a series of human rights """"dialogues"""" with the EU in Beijing early next month. Chinese President Jiang Zemin has given mixed signals on the government's willingness to sign the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) Last October. China signed another key human rights convention, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights -- a step welcomed by Human Rights Watch -- but no action has yet been taken to ratify it. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention visited China last October for the first time, conducting interviews with some thirty prisoners. Their report has not yet been released. While in Beijing, Mr. Cook called for the release of several political prisoners; France's foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, who left for China on Wednesday (January 21), is also expected to press for prisoner releases and the signing of the ICCPR. France has vigorously opposed any action in Geneva. """"Inviting a working group or conducting a dialogue are useful first steps. But unless China follows through by releasing large numbers of prisoners and adopting the recommendations of the U.N. for specific changes in its laws and human rights practices, these steps will end up being largely public relations exercises,"""" said Ms. Leicht. """"A resolution in Geneva can take positive note of what China has offered or agreed to do, but should go further and urge implementation of reforms in China's state security laws, abolition of arbitrary administrative detention, release of prisoners detained for the nonviolent expression of their beliefs, and steps to protect the freedom of association of workers, as well as unofficial religious groups."""" Human Rights Watch endorsed programs to promote the rule of law in China, such as training for judges and lawyers, which the EU partners and other governments support, but stressed that these are long-term initiatives that are unlikely to have any immediate impact on continuing human rights violations given the lack of a free and independent judiciary in China.  Shortly before the UN Commission votes on resolutions and concludes its meeting on April 24, London will host the second ASEM summit of Asian government leaders on April 3-4. Mr. Cook, on behalf of the EU, has invited China's premier to attend the summit, and European governments appear anxious to drop the annual confrontation with Beijing in Geneva in order to remove a potential obstacle to closer economic and political relations.  Both the EU and the U.S. were on the verge of trading away the enormous pressure of the annual Geneva debate for economic gains, Human Rights Watch observed. """"If China escapes all scrutiny in the highest U.N. body charged with monitoring human rights compliance, while continuing wide scale and systemic human rights violations, it will make a mockery of the U.N. system,"""" Ms. Leicht said.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/01/23/cambodia-no-aid-elections-until-rights-guarantees-place","Cambodia- No Aid For Elections Until Rights Guarantees In Place","Cambodia: No Aid For Elections Until Rights Guarantees In Place","","01/23/1998","Human Rights Watch today called on the international community to withhold financial and technical assistance to the Cambodian electoral process until conditions are in place that will be conducive to the organizing of free and fair national elections. Elections are now scheduled for July 26, 1998. The minimum conditions, according to Human Rights Watch, should include concrete steps toward the prosecution of perpetrators of political violence, including those responsible for the killings of opposition political figures during the July 5-6, 1997 coup; restoration of freedom of the press; full freedom for opposition parties to engage in political activities without fear of intimidation or violence by government agents or individuals acting at the government's behest; and an end to the harassment of human rights workers.  In connection with the call for a ban on electoral assistance, Human Rights Watch criticized the European Commission for authorizing U.S. $11.5 million in election aid to Cambodia on January 15, 1998, before the above conditions were in place. Ongoing Impunity and Repression The main obstacles at the moment to free and fair elections in Cambodia are pervasive impunity and a climate of fear, both of which reached new heights with the July coup. Before the coup, Hun Sen was """"Second Prime Minister"""" and Prince Ranariddh was """"First Prime Minister"""" in a coalition government. This power-sharing arrangement was forced on the royalist party, FUNCINPEC, led by the prince, after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party refused to accept the results of the 1993 elections that FUNCINPEC won. After the July coup, Hun Sen retained the title of Second Prime Minister. In the absence of a significant number of opposition parliamentarians who fled after the coup, the National Assembly confirmed Hun Sen's choice for a new first prime minister, Foreign Minister Ung Huot, a member of FUNCINPEC. For all practical purposes, however, Hun Sen is the top decision-maker in the government. In an effort to get beyond international condemnation for human rights violations committed during and after the coup, Hun Sen initiated reforms and made statements that on the surface looked promising. For example, the government encouraged the return of opposition politicians who fled the country after the coup, authorized an opposition rally in December, and is in the process of organizing a National Human Rights Commission with the input of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to investigate reports of violations and abuses. In the aftermath of the coup, Hun Sen pledged that the media and human rights organizations could continue to operate. In a letter to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on October 22, 1997, Hun Sen made a commitment to ensure the safe return of opposition politicians who fled after the coup and to organizing the elections in the """"most democratic and fairest manner possible, with the participation of as many political parties and international observers as possible."""" Crucially-needed laws regulating political parties and the elections were passed by the National Assembly on October 27 and December 19, 1997 respectively.  Despite these encouraging developments, major deterrents persist to creating a neutral political environment for free, fair, and credible elections. Warfare rages between government and opposition troops in the northwest of the country, human rights workers and journalists continue to live in fear, and press freedoms are once again under attack.  Paramount is the problem of impunity, with perpetrators of human rights abuses and summary executions of opposition members and journalists allowed to go unpunished. No opposition candidate will feel fully free to participate in election-related activities, particularly in the provinces, until a precedent has been set for bringing those who commit political violence to justice. Despite a pledge by Hun Sen in September 1997 to address an in-depth report by the Phnom Penh office of the U.N. Centre for Human Rights documenting more than forty cases of extrajudicial executions of FUNCINPEC supporters that took place during and after the coup, to date neither the government nor the judiciary have launched an independent inquiry nor has anyone been charged for these acts. In addition, despite documentation and requests for action by the U.N. Centre and local human rights organizations since the creation of the coalition government in 1993, there have been no arrests or punishment of perpetrators of the murders of at least seven journalists, the attempted murders of five other journalists, the violent attacks on several opposition newspaper offices, or grenade attacks on opposition political rallies. The most serious of these occurred on a gathering of Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party members in September 1995 and on a Khmer Nation Party (KNP) rally on March 30, 1997; in the latter, sixteen were killed and more than one hundred injured. Human rights workers are currently investigating a number of summary executions that have been reported since the July coup. The problem of impunity is compounded by the lack of judicial independence. The Supreme Council of Magistracy, mandated to oversee the independence of the judiciary, can hardly be called neutral as the majority of its members belong to the Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP). A Constitutional Council, which would ensure that all laws passed by the National Assembly are in accordance with the Constitution and resolve election disputes, has yet to be set up.  Despite official pledges to create a neutral political environment, opposition parties still lack access to the broadcast media, with television and radio dominated by the CPP. Equal access to the media by all political parties is critical to the elections because attendance at most political meetings and rallies will undoubtedly be dangerous, so most forms of debate will have to occur primarily through radio, video, and television. This may also be the only means for smaller splinter parties to advertise their new names and logos. The pervasive climate of fear for media workers creates a huge damper on freedom of expression. Over the last four years at least seven journalists have been killed, with none of the perpetrators brought to justice. In the latest incident of violence against a journalist, Nokor Khmer editor Nou Kim Y, a FUNCINPEC member, was fired upon with a silencer-equipped weapon on January 11, 1998, after being chased through the streets of Phnom Penh for almost an hour.  In a renewed threat to freedom of expression, the Ministry of Information has forwarded to the Council of Ministers a restrictive subdecree, or ministerial directive, limiting the scope of the media. The draft press subdecree--which only requires ministerial and executive, not parliamentary, approval--is more repressive than the 1995 Press Law itself. By imposing restrictions on media that threaten national security, which is very broadly defined in the subdecree, any criticism of the government can be construed as treason or an attempt to destabilize the government.  The 1995 Press Law prohibits journalists from publishing anything that affects """"national security"""" and """"political stability"""" but does not specify what those terms mean. The subdecree clarifies that journalists would be prohibited from publishing or broadcasting confidential information endangering the country's territorial integrity, national military or police secrets which could affect military operations or endanger the army or national police, and false information which could cause turmoil within the security forces, destabilize the government, or lead to its overthrow.Violators will face fines and jail terms. The timing on pushing through the subdecree as the electoral process begins is by no means coincidental; the legislation has lain dormant for more than a year in a more watered down form, awaiting action by the Council of Ministers.  In addition, in the last month the Ministry of Information has attempted to expel a foreign correspondent and suspend six opposition newspapers for allegedly threatening national security and spreading false information, backing down only after intervention from King Sihanouk and Hun Sen. Failure to Effectively Ensure Full Participation of all Parties The political party and electoral laws were passed without the input of a significant number of opposition parliamentarians, and contain articles that potentially could be used to deter electoral participation by smaller opposition parties. For example, the Electoral Law requires political parties running in the elections to deposit ten million riel (about U.S. $3,000), and the Political Party Law requires parties to submit detailed name lists, complete with thumb prints, of at least 4,000 members in order to compete in the elections. The financial requirement will effectively bar many of the smaller parties from participation, as will the name lists. Given the atmosphere of impunity for human rights abusers, citizens may well be afraid to publicly sign on with opposition parties out of fear of exposing themselves to the very real risk of reprisal.  The proposed composition of the National Electoral Commission, which is mandated by the Electoral Law to oversee the polling, has come under criticism, with most seats nominated by the four political parties that currently hold seats in the National Assembly. A seat set aside for a representative of local NGOs took on added importance for this reason because it was seen as one position that could be truly neutral. However, according to the Phnom Penh Post of January 2-15, 1998, the president of the Khmer Youth Development Organization--which is thought to receive funding from the CPP--won votes for the NGO seat on the 11-member body on December 29 after allegedly promising NGO representatives $100 each if they voted for him. Despite Hun Sen's pledges to assure the safety of opposition parliamentarians and the recent return of several advance teams of high-profile opposition politicians to assess the political climate, the security of thousands of rank-and-file opposition party workers in remote districts and provinces during the campaign is far from assured. And even some of the top-level exile delegations have had second thoughts about returning. On January 13, 1998, a group of fifty-eight supporters of the Ranarridh-led faction of FUNCINPEC postponed their repatriation, citing concerns about the detention of a FUNCINPEC official while under the protection of U.N. officials, and the attempted suspension of opposition newspapers. Again, if there is to be any confidence among opposition politicians that taking part in the elections will not be a life-threatening move, and if there is to be voter confidence in the electoral process, the issue of investigating, prosecuting, and punishing human rights violators must be addressed. Moves Toward A National Human Rights Commission Within days of the coup, Hun Sen pledged that human rights organizations could continue to operate. Nevertheless, a week after the August 21, 1997 release by the U.N. Centre of a report documenting summary executions, torture, and missing persons at the time of the coup, Hun Sen called for the replacement of some of the U.N. Centre's staff and announced that he would be setting up a national human rights commission to monitor alleged abuses. The message was clear: we will handle the situation ourselves; there is no need for international monitoring. He had earlier demanded an apology from the Centre and accused it of falsely reporting executions; he also claimed that the Centre had convinced dozens of members of the National Assembly to flee unnecessarily. This followed a pattern before the coup of the government periodically attempting to discredit or close down the Centre or deter its work. Justice Minister Chem Sgnuon has been working with a number of NGOs for several months to draft legislation to set up the National Human Rights Commission. Explaining the justification for setting up such a body, Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng, who is co-Minister of Interior, was quoted in Raesmey Kampuchea newspaper on November 15 as saying, """"There are charges of human rights abuses during and after the 5-6 July event, but the government cannot just accept these accusations without first conducting appropriate investigations. This is the reason why the two co-prime ministers have decided to set up a national human rights commission to look into charges made by human rights organizations against the government."""" In meetings with NGOs Chem Sgnuon was reported to have stated explicitly that once the commission is in place, there will be no further need for the U.N. Centre. Officials are pushing for the legislation establishing the commission to be approved by the Council of Ministers by the end of February and then forwarded to the National Assembly. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Centre's current mandate expires in March. Human Rights Watch believes the human rights situation is dire enough in Cambodia to warrant as much monitoring, domestic and international, as possible. A national commission should not be a substitute for the U.N. Centre's Cambodia field office but should work in tandem with it, as long as the commission is established by law and is genuinely independent of the government. Recommendations Human Rights Watch believes elections should take place only if the government shores up its credibility by ending its persecution of the opposition, prosecuting perpetrators of torture and summary executions, lifting restrictions on the press, ensuring the safety of opposition leaders as well as rank-and-file members, and establishing a truly neutral electoral administration. We thus recommend: To the Royal Cambodian Government: All opposition politicians must be allowed to return safely to Cambodia and participate in the elections. Individuals who committed extrajudicial executions and other abuses against opposition members after the military clash of July 5-6, 1997 should be arrested and brought to justice, as well as perpetrators of violent attacks against journalists, newspaper offices, opposition party congresses, and opposition rallies. All parties running in the election should be assured of equal access to print and broadcast media. A broadcast law should be written and passed by the National Assembly that establishes a fair process for applying for broadcasting licenses, and impartial and non-partisan allocation of television and radio frequencies. The Electoral Law should include provisions that power will, in fact, be transferred to the winners of the elections. The National Electoral Commission should be reformulated as a truly neutral body with genuine independence and integrity, and the actual individuals nominated to serve on the Commission should be competent, independent, and credible. The provision in the Electoral Law that calls for political parties running in the elections to deposit ten million riel is overly restrictive and should be amended, as should the 4,000-signature requirement in the Political Party Law. Any national human rights commission set up should be established by law and with provisions that ensure it is independent of the government. Under no circumstances should it be seen as a replacement for international monitoring or as a pretext for restricting access to international monitors. Harassment and threats against the Phnom Penh office of the U.N. Centre in Cambodia should cease and explicit guarantees should be provided that the office will be able to continue to operate without intimidation. The Media Subdecree, which would potentially enable any criticism of the government to be construed as treason or an attempt to destabilize the government, should be withdrawn. The Constitutional Council should be set up immediately to resolve and interpret constitutional issues, insure that all laws passed by the National Assembly are in accordance with the Constitution, and resolve election disputes. The composition of the Supreme Council of Magistracy should be reformulated as a non-partisan and neutral body. To the International Community: Election aid to Cambodia should be made contingent on the establishment of the benchmarks itemized above. Donor countries should continue to provide humanitarian and development assistance to Cambodia through NGOs but should suspend all bilateral and multilateral aid pending compliance by the Cambodian government with the measures outlined above. Assistance for domestic and international monitoring of human rights in Cambodia should be increased. ASEAN should continue to delay Cambodia's membership until the Cambodian government has complied with the recommendations outlined above. The U.N. Human Rights Commission should extend the mandate of the field office of the U.N. Centre for Human Rights when the Commission convenes in Geneva on March 16.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Among the urgent reforms the Vatican should promote in Cuba, according to Human Rights Watch, are an amnesty for political prisoners, reform of the penal code, an end to harassment of dissidents, the ratification and observation of international human rights conventions, respect for freedom of speech and association, legalization of independent Cuban human rights groups, and access to Cuba for international human rights observers. Vivanco suggested the Pope consider the European Union's December 1996 adoption of human rights conditions on economic cooperation a model for relations with the government of Fidel Castro.  At the same time, Human Rights Watch concurred with Vatican and United Nations criticism of the United States embargo on Cuba, which Vivanco derided as """"singularly ineffective in producing human rights improvements in Cuba."""" Noting that the embargo's sole purpose is the overthrow of the Castro government, rather than concrete reforms, Vivanco said the sanctions had failed over the course of decades to produce any change in repressive mechanisms in Cuba. At the same time, the embargo's travel restrictions violate rights guaranteed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty ratified by Washington.  Cuba's human rights problems include the routine crushing of internal dissent by the imposition of prison sentences for so-called crimes such as """"enemy propaganda,"""" """"contempt for authority,"""" """"illicit association,"""" """"dangerousness,"""" and """"illegal exit.""""

Many of them experience dramatic weight loss due to meager food rations, and sometimes life-threatening health problems due to insufficient medical attention. Punitive measures such as prolonged incommunicado detention and beatings are frequent, in violation of Cuba's obligations under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which it ratified in 1995. Prisoners protesting inhumane treatment face retaliatory measures, including beatings, isolation, and criminal prosecution. Moreover, Cuba stands alone in the Western Hemisphere for barring the International Committee of the Red Cross from carrying out its humanitarian mission inside its prisons. The government also restricts access by other humanitarian groups and human rights monitors. Cuban security forces continue to harass and arbitrarily detain scores of nonviolent activists each year, including academics, human rights activists, labor organizers, religious leaders, youth groups, gays and lesbians, and members of unofficial political parties. Independent organizations face unauthorized searches and seizure of office equipment as well as the denial of legal recognition.  On July 15, 1997, security forces detained four prominent, nonviolent leaders of a group that has publicly encouraged a boycott of elections planned for late in the year, and issued a statement challenging Cuba's exclusive recognition of one political party. Professor Félix Antonio Bonne Carcasses, economists Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello and Vladimiro Roca Antúnez, and attorney René Gómez Manzano, members of the Internal Dissidents' Working Group (Grupo de Trabajo de la Disidencia Interna, GTDI), remain in prison and face possible prosecution for """"enemy propaganda"""" and """"revealing state secrets."""" On January 9, 1997, Cuban authorities arrested Héctor Palacios Ruiz, the president of the Democratic Solidarity Party (Partido Solidaridad Democrática, PSD), charging him with contempt for the authority of President Castro and seizing his copies of the Viña del Mar Declaration, a document endorsing democracy and human rights which Castro signed in 1996 at the Sixth Iberoamerican Summit. Palacios Ruiz, whom the Cuban government sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment on September 4, 1997, had questioned the government's willingness to comply with the declaration in an interview with a German journalist.  In light of these abuses, Vivanco calls on the Pope """"to do all in his power to ensure the swift release of political prisoners and secure the dismantling of Cuba's machinery of repression.""""","Americas, Cuba",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/1998/01/14/us-and-mexican-groups-urge-us-oppose-sex-discrimination-mexico","US and Mexican Groups Urge the US to Oppose Sex Discrimination in Mexico","U.S. and Mexican Groups Urge the U.S. to Oppose Sex Discrimination in Mexico","","01/14/1998","U.S. and Mexican human rights groups today urged the Clinton administration to commit to seeking a remedy for widespread pregnancy-based sex discrimination in Mexico's maquiladora (export-processing) sector. """"We are extremely disappointed that the Mexican government remains unwilling to remedy sex discrimination in the hiring process, on the spurious ground that it is not technically illegal under Mexican labor law. However, we welcome the long overdue recognition that maquiladora operators discriminate against women and that the Mexican government is aware of this problem,"""" commented LaShawn R. Jefferson, women's rights researcher for Human Rights Watch. Jefferson added, """"We urge the U.S. Secretary of Labor to call on U.S. corporations operating in Mexico to cease these discriminatory practices, and we urge the Mexican government to reach an interpretation of the law that is consistent with its international obligations to remedy sex discrimination."""" The complaint, filed on May 16, 1997 and based on a 1996 report by Human Rights Watch, alleged that Mexico is in violation of the nafta labor rights side agreement because, by failing to stop mandatory employment-related pregnancy testing in the maquiladoras, it fails to enforce its anti-discrimination labor law. The petitioners also alleged that Mexico denies victims of pregnancy testing access to impartial tribunals in which the sex discrimination can be resolved. This case was the first ever to come before the u.s. nao in which sex discrimination was alleged and access to appropriate labor tribunals was questioned. In response to the complaint, Mexico argued that pre-employment pregnancy screening does not violate Mexican law and that labor tribunals are barred from hearing complaints by people who are not employed, including women who are seeking jobs but who have not been hired. The U.S. Labor Department report, issued on January 12, 1998, found that Mexico's Constitution and Federal Labor Code prohibit discrimination based on gender, and called for """"ministerial consultations,"""" a process through which U.S. Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman will engage Mexico's Minister of Labor and Social Welfare, Javier Bonilla, to clarify the law and practices in Mexico on pre-employment pregnancy screening and post-hire discrimination on the basis of pregnancy. According to the organizations that filed the complaint, the Labor Department report failed to take positions on the essential question of whether pre-employment pregnancy-screening violated Mexico's Federal Labor Code's prohibitions against sex discrimination. Similarly, they said the report did not address the Mexican government's assertion that job seekers should have no access to labor tribunals. The consultation process has yet to be designed. The petitioners in the case urged that the ministerial consultation process be swift and transparent, and that the U.S. use the consultations to reach concrete results in the form of decisive action by the Mexican government to end hiring-process and on-the-job pregnancy-based sex discrimination. Jefferson urged, """"The U.S. position going into these consultations should be unambiguous: pregnancy exams as a condition for employment are a form of illegal sex discrimination, whenever they occur. Every minute wasted discussing the possible legality of a patently illegal practice is a minute lost for women in Mexico facing sex discrimination."""" Under nafta's labor rights side agreement, the signatories voluntarily agreed to have their own labor rights practices reviewed by the other nafta parties. To this end, the labor rights side agreement required each nafta signatory to create a National Administrative Office (nao) to analyze allegations of labor rights violations in the other parties' countries and to work with those countries to resolve problems identified. Should the consultation process not yield positive results, the U.S. may call for the convening of a meeting of experts.

The group called on Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to underscore U.S. concern with the situation when the State Department releases its annual human rights country reports later this month, and for the U.S. and European governments to co-sponsor a resolution at the upcoming U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting establishing the position of a Special Rapporteur for Algeria. The group welcomed the plans of European foreign ministers to visit Algeria, but cautioned that such a visit could not substitute for an internationally sponsored investigation of the atrocities. """"The foreign ministers need to press the Algerian authorities to stop the atrocities, halt the gross abuses committed by security forces, and allow journalists and human rights workers to investigate,"""" said Roth. """"Most importantly, they need to avoid any appearance of supporting the government's refusal to cooperate with an international inquiry."""" A copy of the Brussels statement is available here.
