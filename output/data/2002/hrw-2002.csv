Israeli officials explicitly stated that the attacks were reprisals against the Lebanese civilian population. Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said that he wanted """"all the inhabitants of Lebanon feel what all of Israel feels."""" Reprisals, when aimed at civilians or civilian objects, violate international humanitarian law. """"The laws of war explicitly forbid targeting civilians,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Both sides need to respect international law."""" Background information Attacks on Civilian Infrastructure in Lebanon According to Maj. Gen. Dan Halutz, chief of IDF operations, the government """"decided to carry out an attack on Lebanese infrastructure and not only on Hizballah objectives."""" An IDF official summary of his press conference today said that the targets included """"power and the electrical transformer stations, bridges,"""" """"main arteries of transportation,"""" as well as ammunition depots. The Jamhour power station, located about ten kilometers southeast of Beirut, was attacked three times by Israeli aircraft on Thursday evening. Six hours later, on Friday, the Bsalim station, five miles northeast of Beirut was hit. The attacks left large parts of Beirut and its suburbs without electricity. Agence France-Presse reported that a high-voltage relay station in Meshref, six miles south of Beirut, was also hit today, cutting off electricity to communities in the Shouf mountains. Power facilities were hit in other parts of Lebanon as well. The English-language Daily Star (Beirut) reported today that the Ras al-Ain plant was destroyed, leaving Baalbek without electricity, and a facility in Khirbet Silm in south Lebanon was attacked, cutting off service for residents of the Bint Jbail area. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose cabinet unanimously approved the attacks, was quoted by Israeli radio as saying: """"If there is no quiet in northern Israel, there will be no quiet in Lebanon."""" Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, a cabinet member in the Netanyahu government, told Israel Radio that he had long advocated the idea of """"switching the lights off in Beirut."""" He made clear that the attacks on the electricity infrastructure were reprisals against the Lebanese civilian population: """"The moment residents of Israel living on the Lebanese border sit in their air raid shelters, it's important that they also feel it in Beirut. I have no doubt they will remember this night in Beirut for many years to come. It marks the transition point of a new method -- Israel no longer strikes at some antenna on a hilltop, but hits the infrastructure, and all the inhabitants of Lebanon feel what all of Israel feels."""" Speaking in an IDF press conference this morning, IDF Major General Dan Halutz said that the infrastructure targets """"had been selected a long time ago"""" and that expanding the target list to include non-Hizballah objectives was intended to send a message to the Lebanese that """"all power brokers in Lebanon who support Hizballah's murderous activity are liable to attack."""" Gen. Halutz also remarked that future attacks on Lebanese infrastructure would target """"all sources of power in Lebanon, not just Hizballah, to convey a message that none are immune to an Israeli retaliation if Hizballah attacks continue."""" Israel=s targeting of Lebanon=s infrastructure constitutes indiscriminate attacks under international humanitarian law (the laws of war). The laws of war prohibit attacks on civilians and civilian objects and limit attacks strictly to military objectives. Military objectives are those which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. Under the laws of war, attacks on objects that do not meet this strict test are prohibited. To the knowledge of Human Rights Watch, Israeli government and military officials have not characterized Lebanon=s infrastructure as a legitimate military objective. No official has made the case that this infrastructure is facilitating in any way Hizballah=s attacks on Israel. Rather, government and military officials have indicated that Israel was carrying out reprisals which, when aimed at civilians or civilian objects, violate international humanitarian law. The laws of war also prohibit attacks that destroy objects that are indispensable to the survival of the civilian population. In a modern society like Lebanon=s, electricity should be considered indispensable to the survival of the civilian population because it is needed to power everything from water purification systems to hospitals. Attacks on Israeli Civilians The Katyusha rockets launched into northern Israel towns and settlements by Hizballah guerrillas also are indiscriminate attacks in violation of international humanitarian law. Katyushas are inaccurate weapons with an indiscriminate effect when fired into areas where civilians are concentrated. In addition, the firing of Katyusha rockets into Israel in reprisal for attacks by Israeli and South Lebanon Army military forces that killed or injured Lebanese civilians also violate international humanitarian law, which prohibits attacks against the civilian population or civilians, either directly or by way of reprisals. The Civilian Toll The two Israeli civilians who were killed in Qiryat Shemona brought to nine the total number of Israeli civilians who have lost their lives since 1985 in the military conflict at the Israel-Lebanon border, according to statistics compiled by the IDF. Between 1985 and the present, Lebanese civilians have suffered casualties in much greater numbers. For example, during two Israeli military operations, Operation Accountability (June 1993) and Operation Grapes of Wrath (April 1996), a total of 274 Lebanese civilians were killed and over 1,000 injured. Before this most recent escalation, the last Lebanese civilian deaths in the border conflict occurred on May 17, 1999. Two young men were killed in the village of Zawtar, the multilateral Israel Lebanon Monitoring Group reported, when """"a guided missile fired by Israel and those cooperating with it impacted in the village."""" Following these deaths, Hizballah guerrillas fired at least 59 Katyushas into northern Israel on May 18, 1999. According to the Monitoring Group, 23 of the rockets landed in Qiryat Shemona, and others in Liman, Shelotni, Gerher Haziv, Goren, Metsuba, Kabri, and Granot Hagalil. Three Israeli civilians were injured, and two houses, a factory, a chicken coop, and a car were damaged.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/12/31/beyond-law","Beyond the Law","Beyond the Law ","Justice and the War Against Terrorism","12/31/2002","Where should we draw the line between war and law enforcement in the fight against terrorism? When is it appropriate to track down and kill terrorist suspects or detain them summarily, and when must they be brought before the criminal justice system? Three American actions over the last year prompt those questions: the killing of an Al Qaeda suspect in Yemen, the detention without charge or trial of an alleged enemy combatant in Chicago, and the flouting of a Judicial order against removing terrorist suspects from Bosnia.  The questions arise because the geographic scope of the campaign against terrorism is potentially so expansive. Traditional armed conflict occurs on a reasonably circumscribed battlefield. But US President George Bush has said that the 'war' against terrorism might extend to some sixty countries. Are terrorist suspects in all of these enemy combatants?  The designation matters because it affects the tools that can be used to counter terrorism. If a person is a criminal suspect, he can be arrested and prosecuted. International human rights law permits the use of lethal force against a criminal suspect only if necessary to stop an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. But if a person is an enemy combatant, the law of war permits him to be killed summarily, so long as he is not in custody, incapacitated, or surrendering. There is no duty to attempt to arrest or subdue him. If an enemy combatant is detained, the law of war permits him to be held until the end of the armed conflict, without the need to charge or try him.  SUMMARY JUSTICE  So how do we decide where war ends and law enforcement begins? The law of aggression permits a government to take up arms in self-defence, as the US did following the attacks of September 11 2001. Few would quarrel with Washington's right to pursue Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and deprive it of that territorial base of operations. But does the right of military response extend beyond that traditional battlefield?  For example, US officials charge that Al Qaeda operatives have used London's Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting ground. Assuming that the British government consented, does that give the US the right to kill suspects operating there, or to detain them without charge or trial? Most people would probably have qualms about such action. But if Al Qaeda operatives anywhere in the world are enemy combatants, America would be within its rights to shoot or detain them summarily.  America might similarly attack suspected Al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, where several of the September 11 hijackers lived, or even in Buffalo, New York where an alleged Al Qaeda cell was recently exposed. Indeed, assuming it secured the consent of local governments, Pentagon forces might circle the globe taking out enemy operatives or detaining them without due process.  Such an expansive understanding of US war powers would threaten to overturn decades of effort to build and extend criminal justice guarantees that protect us all from abusive state power. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial -- let alone the right to avoid the death penalty - would give way to Washington's unilateral decision that a suspect was an enemy combatant who could be summarily killed or detained.  That consequence may be unavoidable on the traditional battlefield. Ugly as it is, war gives combatants the right to kill or detain each other. But is war the right way to conceive of the global fight against Al Qaeda, let alone the war against terrorism? Beyond traditional battlefields such as Afghanistan and perhaps western Pakistan, is the war against terrorism a genuine armed conflict? Or is it a rhetorical war - a useful device to drum up public support for an important law enforcement effort, but not a justification for suspending criminal justice guarantees?  JUSTICE FIRST  In the campaign against terrorism, governments should not use war powers where law enforcement is possible. Military force might be justified to combat a serious threat from a lawless land, or from a country whose government refuses to cooperate in meeting the threat. But war rules should not apply when there is a reasonable option of arresting and prosecuting a suspect. That is the only way to avoid creating a huge loophole in our human rights and due process guarantees.  This principle permits us to examine the propriety of various US actions in fighting terrorism. In November, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency used a missile to kill Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, an alleged senior Al Qaeda official, as he drove in a remote and lawless area of Yemen controlled by tribal chiefs. Washington accused al-Harthi of masterminding the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole which killed seventeen sailors.  Based on the limited information available, Human Rights Watch did not criticise the attack on al-Harthi as an extra-judicial execution because his alleged Al Qaeda role arguably made him an enemy combatant, the government apparently lacked control over the area in question, and there was evidently no reasonable law enforcement alternative. Indeed, eighteen Yemeni soldiers reportedly lost their lives in a previous attempt to arrest him.  So far, the United States is not known to have used lethal force outside Afghanistan, Pakistan and the al-Harthi incident. However, Washington has resisted articulating the limits to its war powers. Insight into how expansively it views these powers can be gained from its actions in summarily detaining other Al Qaeda suspects.  A good illustration is the case of Jose Padilla, a US citizen whom the Bush administration claimed had flown from Pakistan to Chicago's O'Hare airport in May to investigate creating a radiological bomb. Instead of charging him with this serious criminal offence and bringing him to trial, he was seized at the airport and then unilaterally declared an enemy combatant. That designation, it was claimed, permitted him to be held without access to counsel and without charge or trial until the end of the war against terrorism, which may never come.  Should Padilla have been classified an enemy combatant? If he was merely a criminal suspect, and since all agree he posed no imminent threat, at most he could have been arrested, charged and tried. But if he came to wage war as an enemy combatant, as the administration claims, he could have been shot in cold blood in the airport terminal rather than detained.  Most people would probably feel uncomfortable were Padilla to have been summarily shot - because most people believe governments should not rely on military force when a criminal justice system is available. But if we are reluctant to start summarily shooting terrorist suspects when they can easily be arrested, we should also be reluctant to designate them as enemy combatants to deny them their right to be charged and tried in a court of law.  SEIZING SUSPECTS  In October 2001, Washington sought the surrender of six Algerians suspected of planning attacks on Americans in Bosnia. After a three-month investigation, Bosnia's Supreme Court ordered the men to be released from custody because of a lack of evidence. When rumours spread of US efforts to seize the suspects anyway, Bosnia's Human Rights Chamber issued an injunction against their removal. Yet in January last year, under pressure from Washington, the Bosnian government ignored this legal ruling and delivered the men to American forces. They were then whisked out of the country, reportedly to the detention centre in Guantanamo Bay.  There was no allegation that law enforcement options were unavailable in Bosnia. Indeed, the Human Rights Chamber was established under the US-sponsored Dayton peace accord and includes six local and eight international members. Nor did anyone allege that the Bosnian judicial system was acting politically or inappropriately. Rather, Washington simply didn't like the results of an apparently fair assessment of the evidence it had proffered to justify arrest. The case highlights the danger to criminal justice rights if the United States can unilaterally invoke war powers far from any recognisable battlefield.  Despite its importance for our due process rights, governments have avoided drawing the line between war and law enforcement. As the leader of the campaign against terrorism, Washington has no incentive to articulate the legal limits to its actions. Indeed, it has often been contemptuous of international law on the matter. But allowing the superpower to operate outside the law degrades the international standards on which all of our rights depend. It is only too easy to imagine governments worldwide identifying their own enemy combatants when the rules of criminal justice prove inconvenient. It is time to reaffirm that even war powers must be exercised under law - before we find that some of our most fundamental rights have been compromised.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

President-elect da Silva takes office on January 1, 2003. """"President-elect Lula da Silva has long been an outspoken advocate for the welfare of marginalized populations,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “We hope that this commitment will now translate into an aggressive program to address the chronic human rights problems that affect the lives of many Brazilians.” The letter offered specific recommendations on how Lula da Silva could make significant progress in improving human rights conditions. These include: Forced labor: The use of forced labor in Brazil’s ranching and timber industries is an extremely disturbing problem that demands an aggressive response from the Brazilian government. The new administration should promote legislation currently before Congress that would establish more severe punishments for those involved in forced labor practices.  Prison conditions: Brazil’s prisons, jails, and police lockups subject prisoners to truly abysmal conditions. Human Rights Watch documented the chronic mistreatment of adult prisoners in its 1998 report, “Behind Bars in Brazil,” as well as the mistreatment of juvenile detainees in a report that will be published in early 2003. The new administration should take steps to reduce overcrowding in detention facilities, curb police and guard brutality, ameliorate harsh physical conditions, and correct the severe deficiencies in the provision of medical care.  Accountability: Many human rights crimes are prosecuted and tried by state-level authorities who are often susceptible to undue influence by local political and economic elites. The result is that serious violations go unpunished. The new administration should promote a constitutional amendment pending before Congress that would address the problem by giving the federal government jurisdiction over grave human rights violations.  HIV/AIDS: Brazil has reduced AIDS-related mortality by more than 50 percent since 1996, largely through the production of generic equivalents of brand name drugs, which has driven down treatment costs. Unfortunately, other countries in the region wishing to emulate Brazil’s success face an international patent system that restricts the production of generic equivalents of patented drugs. The incoming administration should expand access to generic drugs to those marginalized populations within Brazil that have not yet benefited from the country’s AIDS program. It should also take an active role in promoting the right of other countries to import these generics when they are incapable of producing them independently. Brazil’s outgoing president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, took important steps to identify and acknowledge the country’s human rights problems. His administration also made progress toward articulating policies that might address these problems. Unfortunately, however, insufficient progress was made toward implementing these recommendations—in large part because of President Cardoso’s lack of success in pushing needed legislation through Brazil’s congress.  “The challenge your government will now face is to work with the legislature to move Brazil’s human rights policy from diagnosis to action,” the letter stated.","Americas, Brazil",""

In a letter to President George W. Bush, Human Rights Watch said it was “deeply concerned” by allegations made in the Washington Post that detainees had been subjected to torture or other forms of mistreatment while in U.S. custody in Afghanistan or while held by U.S. allies. “Torture is always prohibited under any circumstances,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “U.S. officials who take part in torture, authorize it, or even close their eyes to it, can be prosecuted by courts anywhere in the world.” The Post article, “U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations,” describes how persons held in the CIA interrogation center at Bagram air base in Afghanistan are being subject to “stress and duress” techniques, including “standing or kneeling for hours” and being “held in awkward, painful positions.” Such acts, if true, violate international legal prohibitions against torture and other ill-treatment under treaties that the United States has ratified. These prohibitions apply in times of war as well as peace and protect all captured combatants, whether privileged or not, as well as civilians, whether criminal suspects or not. The Post article states that thousands of persons have been arrested and detained with U.S. assistance in countries known for the brutal treatment of prisoners. The Convention against Torture, which the United States has ratified, specifically prohibits torture and mistreatment, as well as sending detainees to countries where such practices are likely to occur. That would include, according to the U.S. State Department's own annual human rights report, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Jordan and Morocco, where detainees have reportedly been sent. Direct involvement or complicity in torture, as well as the failure to prevent torture by subordinates, may subject U.S. officials to prosecution under international law. Such acts are “grave breaches,” or war crimes, under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In addition, the Convention against Torture obligates all countries to prosecute persons within their jurisdiction who are implicated or complicit in acts of torture. Any competent court anywhere in the world is required to prosecute violations of the prohibition against torture. Moreover, should senior U.S. officials become aware of acts of torture by their subordinates and fail to take immediate and effective steps to end such practices, they would be criminally liable under international law for “command responsibility.” “The allegations made by the Washington Post put the United States on notice that acts of torture may be taking place with U.S. participation or complicity,” said Roth. “That places a heightened duty on senior Bush administration officials to take preventive steps immediately.” Human Rights Watch urged President Bust to issue a presidential statement that it is contrary to U.S. policy to use or facilitate torture in any circumstances. It also urged the president to promptly launch an investigation into the Post's allegations and to make the findings public. Should there be evidence of U.S. civilian or military officials' involvement or complicity in torture, or in the rendition of persons to places where they are likely to be tortured, the administration should take immediate steps to stop these actions and to prosecute those who have ordered, organized, condoned, or carried them out. The United States has a duty not to send persons to countries with a history of torture without explicit, verifiable guarantees that they will not be tortured or otherwise mistreated. Please see below to read the Human Rights Watch letter to President Bush: December 26, 2002 President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Bush: Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned by allegations of torture and other mistreatment of suspected al-Qaeda detainees described in the Washington Post (“U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations”) on December 26. The allegations, if true, would place the United States in violation of some of the most fundamental prohibitions of international human rights law. Any U.S. government official who is directly involved or complicit in the torture or mistreatment of detainees, including any official who knowingly acquiesces in the commission of such acts, would be subject to prosecution worldwide. Human Rights Watch urges you to take immediate steps to clarify that the use of torture is not U.S policy, investigate the Washington Post's allegations, adopt all necessary measures to end any ongoing violations of international law, stop the rendition of detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured, and prosecute those implicated in such abuse. I. Prohibitions Against Torture The Washington Post reports that persons held in the CIA interrogation centers at Bagram air base in Afghanistan are subject to “stress and duress” techniques, including “standing or kneeling for hours” and being “held in awkward, painful positions.” The Post notes that the detention facilities at Bagram and elsewhere, such as at Diego Garcia, are not monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has monitored the U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The absolute prohibition against torture is a fundamental and well-established precept of customary and conventional international law. Torture is never permissible against anyone, whether in times of peace or of war. The prohibition against torture is firmly established under international human rights law. It is prohibited by various treaties to which the United States is a party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States ratified in 1992, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the United States ratified in 1994. Article 7 of the ICCPR states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The right to be protected from torture is non-derogable, meaning that it applies at all times, including during public emergencies or wartime. International humanitarian law (the laws of war), which applies during armed conflict, prohibits the torture or other mistreatment of captured combatants and others in captivity, regardless of their legal status. Regarding prisoners-of-war, article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 states: “No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.” Detained civilians are similarly protected by article 32 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The United States has been a party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions since 1955. The United States does not recognize captured al-Qaeda members as being protected by the 1949 Geneva Conventions, although Bush administration officials have insisted that detainees will be treated humanely and in a manner consistent with Geneva principles. However, at minimum, all detainees in wartime, regardless of their legal status, are protected by customary international humanitarian law. Article 75 (“Fundamental Guarantees”) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which is recognized as restating customary international law, provides that “torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental” against “persons who are in the power of a Party to the conflict and who do not benefit from more favorable treatment under the [Geneva] Conventions,” shall “remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or military agents.” “[C]ruel treatment and torture” of detainees is also prohibited under common article 3 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which is considered indicative of customary international law. II. Possible U.S. Complicity in Torture It is a violation of international law not only to use torture directly, but also to be complicit in torture committed by other governments. The Post reports being told by U.S. officials that “[t]housands have been arrested and held with U.S. assistance in countries known for brutal treatment of prisoners.” The Convention against Torture provides in article 4 that all acts of torture, including “an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture,” is an offense “punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.” The Post article describes the rendition of captured al-Qaeda suspects from U.S. custody to other countries where they are tortured or otherwise mistreated. This might also be a violation of the Convention against Torture, which in article 3 states: “No State Party shall expel, return (‘refouler') or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture…. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.” The U.S. Department of State annual report on human rights practices has frequently criticized torture in countries where detainees may have been sent. These include Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. The United States thus could not plausibly claim that it was unaware of the problem of torture in these countries. III. International Prosecutions for Torture and Command Responsibility Direct involvement or complicity in torture, as well as the failure to prevent torture, may subject U.S. officials to prosecution under international law. The willful torture or inhuman treatment of prisoners-of-war or other detainees, including “willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health,” are “grave breaches” of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, commonly known as war crimes. Grave breaches are subject to universal jurisdiction, meaning that they can be prosecuted in any national criminal court and as well as any international tribunal with appropriate jurisdiction. The Convention against Torture obligates States Parties to prosecute persons within their jurisdiction who are implicated or complicit in acts of torture. This obligation includes the prosecution of persons within their territory who committed acts of torture elsewhere and have not be extradited under procedures provided in the convention. Should senior U.S. officials become aware of acts of torture by their subordinates and fail to take immediate and effective steps to end such practices, they too could be found criminally liable under international law. The responsibility of superior officers for atrocities by their subordinates is commonly known as command responsibility. Although the concept originated in military law, it now is increasingly accepted to include the responsibility of civil authorities for abuses committed by persons under their direct authority. The doctrine of command responsibility has been upheld in recent decisions by the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. There are two forms of command responsibility: direct responsibility for orders that are unlawful and imputed responsibility, when a superior knows or should have known of crimes committed by a subordinate acting on his own initiative and fails to prevent or punish them. All states are obliged to bring such people to justice. *** The allegations made by the Washington Post are extraordinarily serious. They have put the United States on notice that acts of torture may be taking place with U.S. participation or complicity. That creates a heightened duty to respond preventively. As an immediate step, we urge that you issue a presidential statement clarifying that it is contrary to U.S. policy to use or facilitate torture. The Post's allegations should be investigated and the findings made public. Should there be evidence of U.S. civilian or military officials being directly involved or complicit in torture, or in the rendition of persons to places where they are likely to be tortured, you should take immediate steps to prevent the commission of such acts and to prosecute the individuals who have ordered, organized, condoned, or carried them out. The United States also has a duty to refrain from sending persons to other countries with a history of torture without explicit and verifiable guarantees that no torture or mistreatment will occur.

This month Nuon Chea, """"Brother No. 2"""" and deputy to the Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot, finally stepped into a courtroom. Among other crimes, researchers have linked him to the Tuol Sleng torture center where more than 16,000 men, women and children went in and only seven came out alive. Two million Cambodians died from execution, starvation and disease during the rule of Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and others from 1975 to 1979.     But Nuon Chea was not on trial this month for his role in Khmer Rouge crimes. He made a brief appearance to testify in defense of another senior Khmer Rouge figure, on trial for the 1994 deaths of three foreign backpackers. He then left, a free man with a police escort, and returned home.     Cambodians have grown used to the political nature of justice in their country, where government officials do not hesitate to tell judges how to decide cases and prosecutors follow orders instead of evidence.     Last week the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution requesting Secretary-General Kofi Annan to """"resume negotiations"""" with the Cambodian government on the formation of a """"mixed tribunal"""" to try senior leaders of the Khmer Rouge. But 30 members abstained, including Canada and most members of the European Union. They were concerned about Cambodia's apparent lack of commitment.     The United Nations withdrew from negotiations in February after concluding that the government was not serious about meeting minimum international standards. It correctly took the position that a tribunal law signed in August 2001 was structurally unsound and fell short of UN criteria.     The law would create a court with a majority of Cambodian judges and a minority of international judges. The law fails to allow for an independent prosecutor and omits provisions for adequate protection of witnesses. After passage of the law, the United Nations asked for """"concrete signs that our minimum requirements for a fair and credible trial will be met."""" These were not forthcoming.     But instead of supporting the United Nations in sticking to its principles the same principles that the international community demanded when creating the ad hoc tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda supporters of last week's resolution, including Japan, France, the United States and Australia, have pressured the UN to accept an agreement without adequate safeguards.     Cambodian human rights advocates have repeatedly expressed concern that an agreement for its own sake will fail to bring Khmer Rouge leaders to justice or help Cambodians learn the truth about why Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and others led their country into a dark period of tyranny.     There is now a risk that the United Nations will be dragged into a process that will create a sham tribunal. A tribunal that doesn't meet international standards would be an enormous setback for the Cambodian people.     It would also damage the credibility of the United Nations and lower international standards for international justice. In the future, why would countries accept the rigorous models used for the crimes in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda when they could demand the soft """"Cambodian model?""""     Kofi Annan has invited a Cambodian delegation to New York on Jan. 6 to prepare for negotiations. But the UN must not compromise on basic principles. Member states should refrain from exerting any further political pressure on UN officials and should instead send clear signals to the Cambodian government that it must meet the UN's terms.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/12/26/united-states-reports-torture-al-qaeda-suspects","United States- Reports of Torture of Al-Qaeda Suspects","United States: Reports of Torture of Al-Qaeda Suspects","","12/26/2002","The Bush administration must promptly investigate and address allegations of torture of suspected al-Qaeda detainees or risk criminal prosecution. “Torture is always prohibited under any circumstances,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “U.S. officials who take part in torture, authorize it, or even close their eyes to it, can be prosecuted by courts anywhere in the world.” The Post article, “U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations,”  describes how persons held in the CIA interrogation center at Bagram air base in Afghanistan are being subject to “stress and duress” techniques, including “standing or kneeling for hours” and being “held in awkward, painful positions.” Such acts, if true, violate international legal prohibitions against torture and other ill-treatment under treaties that the United States has ratified. These prohibitions apply in times of war as well as peace and protect all captured combatants, whether privileged or not, as well as civilians, whether criminal suspects or not. The Post article states that thousands of persons have been arrested and detained with U.S. assistance in countries known for the brutal treatment of prisoners. The Convention against Torture, which the United States has ratified, specifically prohibits torture and mistreatment, as well as sending detainees to countries where such practices are likely to occur. That would include, according to the U.S. State Department's own annual human rights report, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Jordan and Morocco, where detainees have reportedly been sent. Direct involvement or complicity in torture, as well as the failure to prevent torture by subordinates, may subject U.S. officials to prosecution under international law. Such acts are “grave breaches,” or war crimes, under the 1949 Geneva Conventions. In addition, the Convention against Torture obligates all countries to prosecute persons within their jurisdiction who are implicated or complicit in acts of torture. Any competent court anywhere in the world is required to prosecute violations of the prohibition against torture. Moreover, should senior U.S. officials become aware of acts of torture by their subordinates and fail to take immediate and effective steps to end such practices, they would be criminally liable under international law for “command responsibility.” “The allegations made by the Washington Post put the United States on notice that acts of torture may be taking place with U.S. participation or complicity,” said Roth. “That places a heightened duty on senior Bush administration officials to take preventive steps immediately.” Human Rights Watch urged President Bust to issue a presidential statement that it is contrary to U.S. policy to use or facilitate torture in any circumstances. It also urged the president to promptly launch an investigation into the Post's allegations and to make the findings public. Should there be evidence of U.S. civilian or military officials' involvement or complicity in torture, or in the rendition of persons to places where they are likely to be tortured, the administration should take immediate steps to stop these actions and to prosecute those who have ordered, organized, condoned, or carried them out. The United States has a duty not to send persons to countries with a history of torture without explicit, verifiable guarantees that they will not be tortured or otherwise mistreated. Following is the letter from Human Rights Watch to President Bush.  December 26, 2002 President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500 Dear President Bush: Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned by allegations of torture and other mistreatment of suspected al-Qaeda detainees described in the Washington Post (“U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations”) on December 26. The allegations, if true, would place the United States in violation of some of the most fundamental prohibitions of international human rights law. Any U.S. government official who is directly involved or complicit in the torture or mistreatment of detainees, including any official who knowingly acquiesces in the commission of such acts, would be subject to prosecution worldwide. Human Rights Watch urges you to take immediate steps to clarify that the use of torture is not U.S policy, investigate the Washington Post's allegations, adopt all necessary measures to end any ongoing violations of international law, stop the rendition of detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured, and prosecute those implicated in such abuse. I. Prohibitions Against Torture The Washington Post reports that persons held in the CIA interrogation centers at Bagram air base in Afghanistan are subject to “stress and duress” techniques, including “standing or kneeling for hours” and being “held in awkward, painful positions.” The Post notes that the detention facilities at Bagram and elsewhere, such as at Diego Garcia, are not monitored by the International Committee of the Red Cross, which has monitored the U.S. treatment of detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. The absolute prohibition against torture is a fundamental and well-established precept of customary and conventional international law. Torture is never permissible against anyone, whether in times of peace or of war. The prohibition against torture is firmly established under international human rights law. It is prohibited by various treaties to which the United States is a party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the United States ratified in 1992, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which the United States ratified in 1994. Article 7 of the ICCPR states that “No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” The right to be protected from torture is non-derogable, meaning that it applies at all times, including during public emergencies or wartime. International humanitarian law (the laws of war), which applies during armed conflict, prohibits the torture or other mistreatment of captured combatants and others in captivity, regardless of their legal status. Regarding prisoners-of-war, article 17 of the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 states: “No physical or mental torture, nor any other form of coercion, may be inflicted on prisoners of war to secure from them information of any kind whatever. Prisoners of war who refuse to answer may not be threatened, insulted, or exposed to any unpleasant or disadvantageous treatment of any kind.” Detained civilians are similarly protected by article 32 of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The United States has been a party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions since 1955. The United States does not recognize captured al-Qaeda members as being protected by the 1949 Geneva Conventions, although Bush administration officials have insisted that detainees will be treated humanely and in a manner consistent with Geneva principles. However, at minimum, all detainees in wartime, regardless of their legal status, are protected by customary international humanitarian law. Article 75 (“Fundamental Guarantees”) of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions, which is recognized as restating customary international law, provides that “torture of all kinds, whether physical or mental” against “persons who are in the power of a Party to the conflict and who do not benefit from more favorable treatment under the [Geneva] Conventions,” shall “remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever, whether committed by civilian or military agents.” “[C]ruel treatment and torture” of detainees is also prohibited under common article 3 to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which is considered indicative of customary international law. II. Possible U.S. Complicity in Torture It is a violation of international law not only to use torture directly, but also to be complicit in torture committed by other governments. The Post reports being told by U.S. officials that “[t]housands have been arrested and held with U.S. assistance in countries known for brutal treatment of prisoners.” The Convention against Torture provides in article 4 that all acts of torture, including “an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture,” is an offense “punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.” The Post article describes the rendition of captured al-Qaeda suspects from U.S. custody to other countries where they are tortured or otherwise mistreated. This might also be a violation of the Convention against Torture, which in article 3 states: “No State Party shall expel, return (‘refouler') or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture…. For the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights.” The U.S. Department of State annual report on human rights practices has frequently criticized torture in countries where detainees may have been sent. These include Uzbekistan, Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan and Morocco. The United States thus could not plausibly claim that it was unaware of the problem of torture in these countries. III. International Prosecutions for Torture and Command Responsibility Direct involvement or complicity in torture, as well as the failure to prevent torture, may subject U.S. officials to prosecution under international law. The willful torture or inhuman treatment of prisoners-of-war or other detainees, including “willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health,” are “grave breaches” of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, commonly known as war crimes. Grave breaches are subject to universal jurisdiction, meaning that they can be prosecuted in any national criminal court and as well as any international tribunal with appropriate jurisdiction. The Convention against Torture obligates States Parties to prosecute persons within their jurisdiction who are implicated or complicit in acts of torture. This obligation includes the prosecution of persons within their territory who committed acts of torture elsewhere and have not be extradited under procedures provided in the convention. Should senior U.S. officials become aware of acts of torture by their subordinates and fail to take immediate and effective steps to end such practices, they too could be found criminally liable under international law. The responsibility of superior officers for atrocities by their subordinates is commonly known as command responsibility. Although the concept originated in military law, it now is increasingly accepted to include the responsibility of civil authorities for abuses committed by persons under their direct authority. The doctrine of command responsibility has been upheld in recent decisions by the international criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda. There are two forms of command responsibility: direct responsibility for orders that are unlawful and imputed responsibility, when a superior knows or should have known of crimes committed by a subordinate acting on his own initiative and fails to prevent or punish them. All states are obliged to bring such people to justice. *** The allegations made by the Washington Post are extraordinarily serious. They have put the United States on notice that acts of torture may be taking place with U.S. participation or complicity. That creates a heightened duty to respond preventively. As an immediate step, we urge that you issue a presidential statement clarifying that it is contrary to U.S. policy to use or facilitate torture.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/12/23/open-letter-hong-kong-chief-executive-ch-tung","Open Letter to Hong Kong Chief Executive CH Tung","Open Letter to Hong Kong Chief Executive C.H. Tung","Re: Proposals to Implement Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law","12/23/2002","Dear Chief Executive Tung: We write to express Human Rights Watch's profound concern that proposals by your government to implement Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law will seriously undermine civil liberties and civil society in Hong Kong. The three-month consultation period your administration set aside expires on December 24. Given the enormous public interest from the legal, media, political, religious, and business sectors, we urge your government to continue to seek the widest possible public consultation on a specific text before introducing it to the Legislative Council. Because of the far-reaching consequences and sweeping nature of national security laws, it is impossible to have genuine and meaningful consultation without being able to analyze the specific text of such laws. It is thus vital that experts, interested parties, and Hong Kong people have the opportunity to comment not only on the generalities of the proposed new laws, but the specifics. In particular, where entirely new categories of offenses alien to the common law are being created, such as subversion, it will be essential to thoroughly review and assess the impact of the new laws on society. Both legal and business groups have urged the publication of a White Paper that would contain the exact language proposed in the new law. We encourage you to support this call, particularly as a more methodical approach to consultation may increase public support for any legislation that ultimately emerges. Preserving Fundamental Freedoms The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration guarantees explicitly that all of Hong Kong's freedoms--including press freedom, religious freedom, and freedom of association and assembly-- will continue. They are guaranteed by Hong Kong's strong tradition of adherence to the rule of law and its international commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. These obligations require full compliance. However, aspects of the proposed laws raise serious questions about the HKSAR's commitment to both the International Covenant and the rule of law. Article 23 states that: """"The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any act of treason, secession, sedition, subversion against the Central People's Government, or theft of state secrets, to prohibit foreign political organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies."""" However, as the Hong Kong Bar Association and numerous legal authorities have stated, in most areas the existing laws of the HKSAR are sufficient to prohibit the acts and activities listed in Article 23. Indeed, Hong Kong people have consistently and peacefully exercised their human rights within the rule of law. In the five years since the territory's transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to the People's Republic of China, there have been no significant political upheavals. Any consultation process must first consider whether new legislation of the scope proposed by your government is at all necessary. Most legal commentators who have reviewed the consultation document have concluded that it is not. Perhaps most important, concepts such as treason, secession, sedition, subversion, and state secrets are traditionally vague and open for selective abuse. They, therefore, must be drawn as narrowly as possible. Although the consultation document states the goal of using only precise terms, many of the terms actually proposed are far from precise. Broad New Offenses Will Erode Human Rights Human Rights Watch is especially concerned about new offenses under Article 23 that relate directly to freedom of expression, including sedition, the """"theft of state secrets,"""" and treason (""""instigating a foreigner to invade the PRC""""). A free and unfettered media and a free flow of information have been and will continue to be essential to Hong Kong's long-term success. If businesses want to work in an atmosphere of censorship, self-censorship, and limits on information, then Hong Kong will lose its competitive advantage; enterprises and corporations will simply move to the mainland. The proposed law's definition of """"seditious publications,"""" under which those who publish information inciting others to """"commit treason, secession or subversion"""" or """"endangering the stability of China and Hong Kong"""" can be jailed for seven years, is certain to have a chilling effect on the free flow of information. Much political commentary could be construed by some as inciting others to """"commit treason, secession or subversion."""" If an individual wishes to express such sentiments it is his or her right. Acts, not words, should be punishable in a modern, rights-respecting society. Use of the term """"stability"""" also raises serious concerns. Mainland China and Hong Kong are stable political entities. It is unthinkable that a publication could threaten the stability of either. This inherently imprecise term is often used to arbitrarily punish or censor publications in countries around the world. It is a term that should not be introduced into Hong Kong law, as no editor or journalist will know when they have crossed the line from legal into illegal speech, and no government can adequately assure publications that a future government will not misuse such a provision. The proposal dealing with the subject of """"theft of state secrets"""" or publishing of """"unauthorized"""" news could affect both Hong Kong and overseas reporters. Human Rights Watch believes it must be up to journalists to report any news in the public interest, and that this is a fundamental freedom essential to protecting all other rights. Under this provision information about relations between the mainland government and the HKSAR would be defined as a """"state secret."""" Again, these terms are overbroad and would put at risk any journalist who published even a routine story about China-Hong Kong relations. Editors and journalists remain concerned and confused about the case of Xi Yang, who in 1994 published what appeared to be a routine story about economics but later was imprisoned in China for publishing an article based on information not officially released about government financial policies. Academics, financial researchers, and NGOs could be threatened as well. Interference in Hong Kong Law by China Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned that the proposed new laws under Article 23 give the Secretary for Security wide authority to ban local and foreign political organizations. According to the proposals, a declaration by the Chinese government that an organization endangers China's national security could be sufficient grounds for triggering investigations (or harassment) and possibly for a subsequent ban of a Hong Kong organization. This greatly increases the possibility of Chinese government intervention in Hong Kong. This provision introduces Chinese law and Chinese political control into Hong Kong through the back door, and is a clear violation of both the letter and spirit of the Basic Law. This is particularly worrying since the statements of senior Chinese government officials make it appear that the impetus for the changes to Hong Kong's legal system has come not from the people of Hong Kong, but rather from Beijing. In February Li Peng urged the adoption of a new law, while in late June, when Hong Kong marked five years of return to Chinese sovereignty, Qian Qichen, China's deputy prime minister responsible for Hong Kong affairs, and other senior Chinese government officials told the Hong Kong government to enact a subversion law as soon as possible. Mr. Qian also warned that the group Falun Gong should be banned as an """"evil cult."""" Confidence in the independence of Hong Kong's legal system was further undermined by comments from senior officials, including the Secretary for Security, that the views of Beijing will be given weight when deciding whether to prosecute the Hong Kong media under Article 23 of the Basic Law. In this context, of particular concern to Human Rights Watch is that the proposals for the implementation of Article 23 are similar to national security laws on the Mainland. As Human Rights Watch has documented over the past decade, in China similar subversion laws are regularly used to convict and imprison journalists, labor activists, Internet entrepreneurs, and academics. The Chinese government has tried and sentenced many activists who used the Internet to promote causes ranging from political change to worker rights. All were charged with subversion. Now that Hong Kong is part of China, these examples, taken together with the proposed language of the new subversion laws, give reason for concern that human rights in Hong Kong may be under threat. The consultation documents state that the Hong Kong courts will act as the ultimate safeguard against arbitrary application of any new laws, such as which organizations could be banned. But the decision by Chinese Communist Party's Standing Committee to overrule a decision of the Hong Kong courts in 1999 undermined the previously high confidence in the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary. Can the HKSAR guarantee that a similar intervention could not happen if Beijing was not satisfied with the decision of the Hong Kong courts in implementing these new laws? Popular Concern Concerns about Article 23 are not part of an abstract discussion. Many groups and individuals have written to your government to express their dismay at the planned changes to Hong Kong laws. Last week, there was a large public demonstration with tens of thousands of participants--many more than even the organizers hoped would attend. We strongly urge your administration to listen to these voices of civil society and to Hong Kong's friends in the international community before moving forward to implement any new laws on subversion. We also wish to add that the preservation of Hong Kong's rule of law, along with basic rights and freedoms in Hong Kong, provides an important example for China's own reforms and progress in these areas. We thus hope your government will not end its public consultation on Article 23 on December 24, but will present the draft legislation first to the public for comment and initiate an even wider discussion about the impact such laws will have on Hong Kong's vibrant free press and free society. We urge your government to amend the draft to address adequately all these concerns before the draft is introduced to the Legislative Council for the legislative process. Finally, senior officials in your government regularly argue that Article 23 of the Basic Law requires them to legislate to prohibit subversion and other offenses. Yet the Basic Law also mandates a move toward democratic election of the legislature and chief executive with the ultimate goal of """"universal suffrage,"""" a process that has not begun. We urge you to explain to the people of Hong Kong why the provisions of Article 23, which could have a serious impact on fundamental human rights, must be implemented so urgently while one of the core principles of the Basic Law--the right of people to choose their own leaders--is being ignored. On June 25, 2002, Deputy Prime Minister Qian Qichen, asserted that the current system, in which only half the Legislative Council may be directly elected, should be """"kept intact."""" But the best long-term guarantor of civil liberties is a government accountable to and responsive to its people, together with an independent judiciary. We urge your government to initiate the process of instituting a fully democratic system as soon as possible. This is a more urgent priority than implementing the provisions of Article 23.

To date, only 12 people have been tried before the Ad Hoc Human Rights Court for East Timor in Jakarta, and 10 have been acquitted. Of the 10, nine were Indonesian military and police personnel. The court has convicted only two people; both are East Timorese.  """"The trials in Jakarta have been a whitewash,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Indonesia has failed in its promise to hold the military accountable for the atrocities in East Timor."""" The United Nations secretary-general should commission an experts' report examining the failure of the ad hoc court, Human Rights Watch said. In the 13-page briefing paper, Human Rights Watch stressed the obligation of the United Nations and its member states to ensure accountability for the 1999 violence, which occurred after the people of East Timor voted for independence in a U.N.-administered referendum. In 2000, the secretary-general pledged to """"closely monitor"""" Indonesia's trials to ensure that they were a """"credible response in accordance with international human rights principles.""""  The briefing paper describes the refusal of prosecutors to indict senior leaders such as then-chief of staff General Wiranto, named by the Indonesian Human Rights Commission as responsible for the 1999 violence. President Megawati Sukarnoputri later described many of the military leaders involved in the violence in East Timor as """"national heroes"""" for their role in fighting for their country and publicly urged the military to """"carry out your duties and responsibilities in the best possible manner without having to worry about human rights abuses."""" """"Indonesia's political leaders have created an atmosphere of impunity for these trials,"""" said Adams. """"It is clear that the most senior members of the Indonesian military responsible for the violence will receive only perfunctory trials. Some Indonesian military officers implicated in atrocities have actually been promoted.""""  While all of the accused have been charged with crimes against humanity, the indictments only allege that they failed to control their subordinates, not that they actually planned and ordered the attacks themselves. Verdicts in remaining cases are expected in the next few weeks. The tribunal's mandate is due to expire on January 3, 2003. Among the cases still to be decided are Major General Adam Damiri, former chief of the Udayana Regional Military Command, who has been indicted on two counts of crimes against humanity.  """"We do not recommend an extension of the mandate, since this process has proven to be fatally flawed,"""" said Adams. """"We urge the United Nations and donors to think of a different means of achieving justice based on international standards."""" Human Rights Watch commended the efforts of a parallel process in East Timor, while noting serious technical weaknesses. The United Nations has created a special investigation unit and a special court in East Timor to hold perpetrators there accountable. Human Rights Watch urged donors to provide more training and resources to judges, prosecutors and investigators and called for an extension of the mandate of the special court and investigators in Dili. In September 1999, the Indonesian National Army and Timorese militias carried out a campaign of murder, arson and forced expulsion after the people of East Timor voted for independence in a United Nations-administered referendum. After almost 25 years of brutal occupation, an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 East Timorese civilians lost their lives in the months before and days immediately after the voting. Approximately 500,000 people were forced from their homes or fled to seek refuge.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice"

The law establishes a special """"mixed tribunal"""" presided over by a majority of Cambodian judges and co-prosecutors, along with judges and prosecutors from other countries. But the tribunal will not come into being without the agreement of the United Nations.  Thus far, the United Nations has taken a principled stand, insisting that the law and any agreement between Cambodia and the United Nations contain provisions that guarantee minimum international standards of justice, including independent judges and prosecutors, access to appropriate defense counsel, and provisions for witness protection. But countries such as France and Japan, which co-sponsored the U.N. resolution, together with the United States and Australia, have put strong pressure on the United Nations to compromise international standards to reach an agreement with Cambodia.  """"The United Nations must not be forced into a bad agreement that only creates the appearance of justice,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Cambodians have waited too long to watch a sham.""""  The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975-79. During its reign, approximately two million Cambodians died from executions, diseases and starvation.  """"Many consider this period to be the darkest in human history, yet no Khmer Rouge leader has ever stood trial,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.  Cambodian human rights groups and the Cambodian Bar Association have consistently called for trials that meet international standards. On December 9, the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee called on the Cambodian government to """"fulfill its obligations to find justice for the dead by accepting international standards of justice.""""  While Cambodians have made clear their desire for justice, many former Khmer Rouge leaders live freely among their victims, and even travel abroad. Only two are in custody. Pol Pot's former deputy, Nuon Chea, lives in Pailin, along the Thai border, and recently traveled to Thailand. The former President of the Khmer Rouge, Khieu Samphan, has also """"retired"""" in Pailin. Both left the Khmer Rouge in late 1998 as the movement was collapsing and were treated as returning heroes by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who announced that it was time to """"bury the past."""" Former Khmer Rouge Foreign Minister Ieng Sary lives in a villa in Phnom Penh. Hun Sen has publicly stated that Ieng Sary will never be put on trial.  The United Nations and Cambodian government have been involved in negotiations over the creation of a tribunal for the Khmer Rouge since 1997, when the Cambodian government asked the United Nations to help establish a tribunal like those in the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. In 1999, a U.N. group of experts wrote a detailed and widely praised report calling for an international tribunal, citing the lack of independence and public confidence in the Cambodian judiciary. This was rejected by Prime Minister Hun Sen. Under pressure from the United States, France and others, the United Nations agreed in 2000 to participate in the first """"mixed tribunal,"""" in which there would be a majority of Cambodian judges and co-prosecutors.

The 52-page report, """"We Want to Live As Humans"""": Repression of Women and Girls in Western Afghanistan, focuses on the increasingly harsh restrictions on women and girls imposed by Ismail Khan, a local governor in the west of Afghanistan who has received military and financial assistance from the United States. Human Rights Watch said that the situation in Herat was symptomatic of developments across the country, and that women and girls were facing new restrictions in several other regions as well. """"Many people outside the country believe that Afghan women and girls have had their rights restored. It's just not true,"""" said Zama Coursen-Neff, the co-author of the report and counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Women and girls are still being abused, harassed, and threatened all over Afghanistan, often by government troops and officials."""" Human Rights Watch found that women's and girls' rights in Herat had improved since the fall of the Taliban, noting that many women and girls have been allowed to return to school and university, and to some jobs. But the report found that these advances were tempered by growing government repression of social and political life. Ismail Khan has censored women's groups, intimidated outspoken women leaders, and sidelined women from his administration in Herat. Restrictions on the right to work mean that many women will never be able to use their education. The Human Rights Watch report said that the Herat government has even recruited schoolboys to spy on girls and women and report on so-called un-Islamic behavior. In some instances, police under Ismail Khan's command have questioned women and girls seen alone with men, even taxi drivers, and arrested those who are not related. Human Rights Watch said that men caught in such circumstances are usually taken to jail; women are brought to a hospital, where police force doctors to conduct medical exams on the women to determine whether they have had recent sexual intercourse, or if unmarried, whether they are virgins. """"Ismail Khan has created an atmosphere in which government officials and private individuals believe they have the right to police every aspect of women's and girls' lives: how they dress, how they get around town, what they say,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"Women and girls in Herat expected and deserved more when the Taliban were overthrown."""" Human Rights Watch said that problems for women and girls were growing worse in many parts of the country outside of the capital, Kabul. Throughout 2002, girls' schools in at least five different provinces have been set on fire or destroyed by rocket attacks. Human Rights Watch said that reports from around the country indicate that government troops and officials regularly target women and girls for abuse, often invoking vague edicts on dress and social behavior. In many areas, local police and troops are enforcing Taliban-era restrictions, including banning music and forcing women and adolescent girls to continue wearing burqas. Human Rights Watch said that many of these local forces have received weapons and assistance from the United States and other countries during 2002. Human Rights Watch called on all countries involved in Afghanistan to cease military assistance to local commanders and to coordinate all future aid through Kabul's central government. Human Rights Watch urged the Afghan Transitional Administration in Kabul to prohibit harassment and abuse targeted at women, and to appoint new civilian governors in provinces in which serious abuses against women and girls are occurring. Human Rights Watch also called on the international community to support the Afghan government in these efforts. It urged international donors to support the work of Afghan women, inside and outside of the government, for example, by supporting women's groups throughout the country. Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to expand human rights monitoring efforts and to continue efforts to strengthen the Afghan Human Rights Commission, in order to help protect all Afghans seeking to speak openly and challenge abusers.  Noting that efforts to improve security and human rights protection would require an increased presence of international peacekeepers, Human Rights Watch urged the United States, Germany, and the Netherlands to lead efforts to expand international peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan, which are currently stationed only in the Kabul area. Germany and the Netherlands will take joint command of the peacekeeping forces in early 2003. Human Rights Watch urged the United States, European Union nations, and NATO, as well as Pakistan, Iran, and other countries bordering Afghanistan to contribute logistical and intelligence support necessary for international peacekeeping to expand. """"The U.S.-led coalition justified the war against the Taliban in part by promising that it would liberate Afghanistan's women and girls,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"In fact, by supporting repressive warlords, the international community has broken that promise and forsaken women's rights."""" The Human Rights Watch report is the second of two reports on Herat.

Adil Jassim Flaifil, a former colonel in the State Security and Intelligence Service, is reportedly under investigation on fraud and embezzlement charges, but a government prosecutor said last week that a February 2001 amnesty decree also covers security officials accused of human rights violations committed before that date. On December 11, lawyers for eight Bahrainis attempted to file a formal complaint with the general prosecutor’s office naming Col. Flaifil as one of the persons responsible for acts of torture committed against them during periods of arbitrary detention in the 1994-1997 period. The general prosecutor reportedly told them they were wasting their time and refused to accept the complaint.  In a letter sent today, Human Rights Watch called on Bahrain’s king, Shaikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, to clarify that Decree 56 of October 23, 2002, which extends the February 2001 amnesty to cover acts of government officials, will not apply to allegations of serious crimes such as torture.  “The government of Bahrain has long been aware of serious allegations against Colonel Flaifil,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “We have seen the complaint that the lawyers tried to file last week, and the details are consistent with our investigation of the 1996-97 period.”  Stork noted that such use of an amnesty is inconsistent with Bahrain’s constitution and penal code, and with the country’s obligations as a State Party to the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

Box 555 Rifa’a Palace Kingdom of Bahrain  Your Majesty, We are writing you to with regard to the urgent matter of Adil Jassim Flaifil, formerly a colonel in the Security and Intelligence Service of Bahrain. We urge your government to undertake to conduct a full and impartial investigation into allegations that Col. Flaifil engaged routinely in the torture and ill-treatment of persons taken into custody by the security services over a period of many years. These allegations concern crimes of utmost gravity, and on the basis of research that we conducted we believe the allegations are sufficiently credible as to require such a step. Human Rights Watch has publicly welcomed many of the reforms that Your Majesty has decreed over the past several years, in particular the abolition of the State Security Law of 1976 and the State Security Courts, the release of prisoners convicted under that law and by that court following trials that failed to meet international fair trial standards, and the return of Bahraini citizens who had been forcibly exiled. However, we are concerned that your government has failed to act consistent with its obligation, under Bahrain’s constitution and as a state party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, to investigate, and if appropriate prosecute and punish, officials against whom there are credible allegations of torture. Col. Flaifil apparently fled Bahrain in early May 2002, shortly before he was to testify before a panel investigating charges of fraud and embezzlement that had been made against him. He returned to Bahrain on or about November 23, from Australia. According to news reports, his passport has been confiscated so as to prevent him from traveling abroad while the investigation on fraud charges proceeds. Human Rights Watch takes no position on the fraud and embezzlement charges lodged against Col. Flaifil. We are disturbed, however, that the government has so far failed to take steps to investigate the serious and credible allegations of Bahraini citizens naming Col. Flaifil as the person responsible for authorizing and carrying out acts of torture against them personally. The government has long been aware of these allegations. Human Rights Watch conducted an investigation during 1996 and 1997 into allegations of torture in Bahrain in the course of preparing a comprehensive report on Bahraini human rights practices. This report, Routine Abuse, Routine Denial: Civil Rights and the Political Crisis in Bahrain, published in June 1997, was made available to numerous officials of the government at the time. Many former prisoners whom we interviewed for this report alleged that they had been tortured while in the custody of the SIS, and several cited Col. Flaifil by name as one of the perpetrators. Since Col. Flaifil returned to Bahrain several weeks ago, there have been numerous peaceful demonstrations calling on the government to conduct a criminal investigation into these allegations. Twelve members of Bahrain’s newly-elected National Assembly, including members considered to be supporters of the government, are reportedly among the many Bahrainis who have called publicly for his prosecution on torture charges. On December 11, lawyers for eight Bahrainis—Fakhri Abdallah Rashid Khalil, Mirza Ibrahim al-Qatari, Ali Salman Isa Ahmad, Sami Abdallah Hassan Abu Hamad, Ahmad Mahdi Salman Daoud, Majeed Milad Ahmad al-Jazeeri, Hussain Ali Muhsin al-Tittan, and Ra’id Salman Abdallah al-Khawaja—attempted to file a complaint with the office of the general prosecutor in the Ministry of Interior. These complaints, copies of which have been provided to Human Rights Watch, set out the circumstances of their incarceration. For example, Mirza Ibrahim al-Qatari, a fruit merchant, was detained on April 24, 1996 for alleged possession of illegal printed materials and a possible weapons violation. He was held without trial for more than a year before being convicted on June 14, 1997 by a State Security Court and released two weeks later. Majeed Milad Ahmad al-Jazeeri, arrested on December 18, 1994, spent three and a half years in detention, most of that time without trial, on charges that he was a member of an unlicensed organization and incited demonstrations calling for the reinstatement of Bahrain’s parliament. Both reported that they were, among other things, suspended for extended periods and beaten on the soles of their feet, subjected to objects inserted into the anus, not permitted for long periods to sleep, and threatened with rape of themselves or of their wives or family members. Others asserted that they had been kicked in the genitals and not permitted to urinate or defecate. All eight named Col. Flaifil as one of the persons responsible for authorizing, supervising and perpetrating these and other acts of torture and ill-treatment. According to a report in the independent Bahraini daily Al-Wasat on December 13, 2002, the lawyers who attempted to present the complaints to the general prosecutor’s office were told by the head of the legal affairs bureau, Ali Fadl al-Bua’nain that “it is not an investigatory arm” and that individual complaints should be directed to the criminal investigations department. After leaving the general prosecutor’s office, the head of legal affairs phoned to invite the lawyers to return to meet with his superior, Col. Muhammad Rashid Abu Hamud, the general prosecutor. According to information Human Rights Watch has received, Col. Abu Hamud told the lawyers that they would be wasting their time to attempt to file such a complaint with the investigations directorate, and refused to provide a signed acknowledgement of receipt of the complaint. The general prosecutor reportedly claimed that he was not obliged by law to do so and that Decree 56/2002, which Your Majesty issued on October 23, 2002, in effect extended Decree 10/2001, the general amnesty of February 2001, to cover human rights violations committed by government and security officials as well as offences by political opponents of the government. We strongly urge your government to clarify that it does not intend to use Decree 56/2002 for the purpose of immunizing against prosecution persons alleged to have committed serious crimes such as torture. Such use of your amnesty powers would be highly inconsistent with reforms you have proclaimed, such as abolition of the State Security Court, as well as with Article 3/19 of Bahrain’s constitution, which states that “no individual should be subject to physical or psychological torture, or assault, or degrading treatment, and the law is to punish those who perpetrate it.” Article 208 of Bahrain’s Penal Code states that “employees of the state are to be punished if they employ torture, violence, force or the threat thereof, directly or indirectly with any accused, witness or expert to coerce them into admission of a crime or relinquishing information about a crime.” Such use of Decree 56/2002, furthermore, is inconsistent with Bahrain’s obligation as a State Party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Among the requirements of the convention are that each State Party ensure that: · “all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law” and that such offences are “punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature” (Article 4); · “its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction” (Article 12); and · “any individual who alleges that he has been subjected to torture…has the right to complain to, and to have his case promptly and impartially examined by, its competent authorities” (Article 13). Human Rights Watch believes that the consistency and seriousness of these allegations warrants urgent attention by the authorities. We therefore urge you to clarify publicly that Decree 56/2002 and the general amnesty of February 2001 do not apply to grave crimes such as torture. We further urge the government to respond positively to requests by many Bahrainis to conduct a full and impartial investigation into the charges against Col. Flaifil and the fifteen other officials named in the complaint of December 11, and that this investigation includes the testimonies of Bahrainis who allege that they were victims of torture committed by and under the authority of Col. Flaifil. The results of the investigation should be made public. If warranted by the findings, the government should prosecute Col. Flaifil and other officials as appropriate on charges of torture and ill-treatment, in trials that meet international due process standards. If Col. Flaifil and/or other officials are found guilty of these charges, the government should provide a punishment commensurate with the seriousness of the crimes committed.

Human Rights Watch takes no position on the use of force to remove Saddam Hussein from power. However, as the possibility for armed conflict and a transition in Iraq increase, the international community and the future leadership of Iraq must address the question of how serious crimes such as genocide should be prosecuted. Human Rights Watch welcomed several of the recommendations in the declarations issued by the Iraqi opposition conference, including the intention of working towards the referral of the perpetrators of the crime of genocide and the gassings at Halabja to an international tribunal. However, the conference did not address the question of accountability for other equally serious crimes, including crimes against humanity, although these were condemned.  Human Rights Watch also said it was concerned at the inclusion in the 65-member Coordination and Follow-Up Committee appointed by the conference of some former members of Iraq's repressive apparatus who have been involved in serious human rights violations. Among them is Wafiq al-Samarra'i, former head of Iraq's notorious Military Intelligence, believed to be implicated in crimes at a time when gross and systematic human rights abuses were perpetrated as part of Iraqi government policy. Having held such a position of high responsibility, al-Samarri'i warrants an in-depth investigation to determine the degree of his involvement in these crimes.  """"Justice for past crimes is going to be an enormous issue if Saddam Hussein falls,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Perpetrators of gross human rights abuse should obviously not be a part of any new government.""""  No amnesties should be granted for incidences of genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes, and an international tribunal should investigate and try both senior and middle-level officials accused of those crimes, said Human Rights Watch.  Some Iraqi opposition figures as well as U.S. administration officials have suggested that they support the prosecution of relatively few elite commanders in Iraq in order to encourage defections of top Iraqi military and civilian officials.  """"There is an unwarranted fear that insisting on justice will jeopardize any government transition in Iraq,"""" said Megally. """"The record from Africa, Latin America and Europe is clear: only a transition that builds in a process of accountability for grave human rights violations will lead to a just and reconciled society.""""  Crimes committed under Saddam Hussein's government include, but are not limited to: the gassing of up to 5,000 Kurdish villagers in one chemical weapons attack in Halabja killings and disappearances of Shi`a and other segments of the populations - with victims believed to range between 250,000 and 290,000 over the past two decades, among them at least 100,000 people who are believed to have perished in the Anfal campaign against the Kurds; the use of chemical weapons in the Iran-Iraq War; and crimes incident to the occupation of Kuwait.  In its backgrounder, Human Rights Watch argued that these crimes constitute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. An international tribunal is needed, Human Rights Watch said, because the Iraqi justice system is too compromised to render verdicts impartially, fairly and independently, while military tribunals will smack of """"victors' justice.""""  The Human Rights Watch backgrounder states that other international mechanisms, such as the International Criminal Court or third-country prosecutions, could complement but cannot replace an international tribunal. Mechanisms such as a truth commission established by a transition Iraqi government could also play a vital reconciliation function in conjunction with the tribunal.  """"In periods of transition, truth and justice are mutually reinforcing."""" said Megally """" Both are needed as part of a genuine accountability effort. But establishing a truth commission would not absolve a new Iraqi authority from its duty under international law to prosecute the most heinous crimes."""" Human Rights Watch also warned that amnesties for such crimes would contravene international law and fail to provide a sound foundation for re-establishing civil society and the rule of law in Iraq.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/12/16/ask-saudi-officials-some-tough-questions","Ask Saudi Officials Some Tough Questions","Ask Saudi Officials Some Tough Questions","Mysterious Bombings","12/16/2002","CAIRO— Saudi Arabia's wink-and-nod approach to terrorism has rightly raised a critical storm in the United States. But the winking and nodding began almost a year before the terrorist attacks in September 2001, in the Saudi government's response to a series of mysterious bombings on its own soil. The targets were Westerners who lived in the kingdom. Until now, no one has claimed responsibility for any of the incidents. It is likely that the real perpetrators have not been identified. It is clear that Saudi officials are loath even to consider that the attacks might be the work of home-grown terrorists. The first of the attacks occurred in Riyadh on Nov. 17, 2000, killing the British citizen Christopher Rodway when a bomb exploded under his vehicle. David Brown, a Scot, lost his eyesight and right hand when he removed a bomb from his car on Dec. 15, 2000, in Khobar. Gary Hatch, an American, lost one eye and his left arm when he opened a letter bomb delivered to his office in Khobar on May 2, 2001. Simon Veness, a Briton, was killed in Riyadh last June 20 when a bomb exploded inside his vehicle. The last attack took place on Sept. 29, also in Riyadh, when the car of W. Maximilian Graf, a German, exploded, killing him. Saudi Arabia's powerful and unaccountable Interior Ministry pointed the finger at seven Westerners, who were charged and sentenced in connection with the earliest attacks, although no evidence was ever presented against them. Some of the kingdom's trademark tools - among them torture, coerced confessions and secret trials - were used to implicate these men, while Saudi officials insisted that their own citizens were not responsible. The Saudis said the violence was the result of a turf war among Western expatriates involved in the illegal but lucrative alcohol trade, and rounded up some suspects. The first group - a Canadian, William Sampson, a Briton, Alexander Mitchell, and a Belgian, Raf Schyvens - was shown on Saudi television on Feb. 4, 2001, confessing to two bombings in Riyadh in November 2000. Their videotaped statements were made after they had been held incommunicado for more than a month without their respective consulates being informed. A second group - James Cottle, James Lee and Les Walker, all British - appeared on Saudi television on Aug. 13, 2001. They confessed that they had received orders to carry out attacks in Riyadh on Jan. 10 and March 15, 2001, and in Khobar on Dec. 15, 2000. They, too, had been held in solitary confinement. The families of the Westerners were shocked at the accusations, saying they were unbelievable. The confessions provided no information about the motives for the random violence and no disclosure of who had allegedly ordered the attacks. On Feb. 8, 2001, in London, The Times cited an unnamed U.S. security source who revealed that British and American investigators had found plastic explosive C4 in the bombs. """"It does not appear to be the work of men arguing over drinking clubs,"""" the source told The Times. Moreover, the violence continued even after the Western suspects were in custody. The six who confessed on television - and Peter Brandon, a Briton - were tried in secret without their Saudi lawyers present. Sampson and Mitchell were sentenced to death. Brandon, Cottle, Lee and Walker received 18-year prison terms, and Schyvens a sentence of eight years. In an appeal to the Supreme Judicial Council, the Saudi defense lawyers for six of the defendants itemized the failures of the justice system in the case. They said that not a single piece of evidence was ever presented to implicate their clients other than confessions extracted under torture. According to the lawyers, the men were suspended upside down with their hands and feet bound, forced to stand with their hands shackled to the top of a door, slapped and punched, and subjected to continuous sleep deprivation for up to 10 days. The lawyers criticized the judges who confirmed the confessions and ignored the claims of torture, which are clear violations of Saudi law. The connection between human rights abuses and terrorism in Saudi Arabia merits serious scrutiny. The Bush administration and congressional critics should ask Crown Prince Abdullah and other senior Saudi officials tough questions about how justice is administered in the kingdom, starting first with the official investigations and legal proceedings surrounding the anti-Western bombings. Some outspoken relatives of the imprisoned men argue that the miscarriage of justice in this case has enabled homegrown Saudi terrorists to operate with impunity in the kingdom. If that is true, it means that human rights victims are wrongly imprisoned and foreigners remain at risk in Saudi Arabia because the real bombers are free.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Saudi Arabia","Torture"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/12/16/condemning-crackdown-western-china","Condemning the Crackdown in Western China","Condemning the Crackdown in Western China","","12/16/2002","Beijing's domestic war against terrorism has gone global. In September, the U.S. joined China in asking the United Nations Security Council to add to the U.N.'s terrorist list an obscure Uighur group, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement, a target of Beijing's war against """"ethnic splittists, religious extremists and violent terrorists."""" And Chinese President Jiang Zemin's recent summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin was capped by pledges of mutual support to crush Muslim separatists in Xinjiang and Chechnya. Since the Sept. 11 attacks, China has tried to use the terrorism issue to bolster its domestic political agenda. Its greatest accomplishment was moving the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush from a position of unqualified criticism of China's crackdown on ethnic minorities to taking actions that indirectly lend legitimacy to Beijing's policies. But the Bush administration is now increasingly concerned about China's diplomatic offensive, as Beijing uses the U.S. decision on ETIM to justify a broad crackdown on peaceful Uighur dissent and Muslim religious activities -- a crackdown that long predates Sept. 11. In August, the U.S. put ETIM on its own terrorist list, ordering the freezing of its assets. Most significantly, Washington gave credence to China's claims that organizations such as ETIM have links with al Qaeda. A U.S. State Department counterterrorism official said that ETIM has """"more recently become al Qaeda-linked and now operates outside of China."""" Washington also claimed it had intelligence data indicating the group was planning attacks on American interests in Central Asia. This week's extraordinary visit to Xinjiang by the top U.S. human-rights official from Washington is clearly an effort at damage control. Lorne Craner, the assistant secretary of state for democracy and human rights, is due to travel to Xinjiang on Wednesday to give a speech at a university in Urumqi, the region's capital, and to meet with local Chinese officials. But sending an American diplomat to Xinjiang to give a speech is not enough. The U.S. must do much more to maintain any credibility in its China policy. Mr. Craner is in Beijing today and tomorrow for the latest round in the U.S.-China bilateral human-rights dialogue, a largely pro-forma exercise underway for more than a decade. The U.S. dialogue -- and similar human-rights talks with the European Union, Japan, Canada, Australia and other governments -- has produced some information on political prisoners and a few prisoner releases, but no major changes in Chinese government policy. Both sides can claim progress is being made, and China prefers to discuss human rights behind closed doors. But the severe human-rights conditions in Xinjiang require a tougher approach. The far northwestern province has a population of 18 million and numerous Turkic-speaking Muslim ethnic groups; the Uighurs, numbering eight million, are the largest. Much like Tibetans, they've struggled to maintain their cultural and ethnic identity as Xinjiang has undergone a transformation with the influx of ethnic Han Chinese; the Han population is now about 7.5 million. There has long been a strong movement, with roots inside Xinjiang and among exiled Uighurs, opposing Chinese rule. Most groups support using peaceful means to achieve """"real autonomy"""" or independence. There have been some violent incidents. The most dramatic took place in February 1997, when large-scale riots broke out in the town of Yining when Chinese security forces brutally suppressed a peaceful protest. Following the riots, authorities closed mosques and religious schools, rounded up suspected activists and staged sentencing rallies across the region. A month later, two bombs exploded on public buses in Urumqi, killing civilians. Since then, there have been scattered attacks on Chinese troops, security officials, political leaders and police. Although some individual Uighurs went to Afghanistan to fightwith the Taliban, there is no clear evidence that key Uighur separatist groups receive support from external Islamic networks. Human Rights Watch has no independent information on ETIM and its alleged links to al Qaeda. Those who commit violence should be prosecuted under appropriate laws, with full due process and legal safeguards. But in Xinjiang Chinese authorities are ruthless in suppressing virtually all forms of dissent, not distinguishing between peaceful and violent activities. President Jiang Zemin visited Xinjiang in August 1998 and called for a """"people's war"""" against separatists. The nationwide """"Strike Hard"""" anticrime campaign, launched in April 2001, has been waged in Xinjiang with a vengeance. Officials have carried out widespread arbitrary arrests, shut down places of worship, restricted traditional religious activities and sentenced thousands of people to harsh prison terms or death after unfair and often summary trials. Muslim religious activities are controlled. Students at state schools and universities are not allowed to pray, fast during Ramadan or carry out other open religious activity. Earlier this year, officials ordered increased surveillance of Muslim weddings, funerals and circumcisions. Some have been arrested for translating the Koran into local languages. These actions are clearly counterproductive, increasing resentment of Chinese control. President Bush spoke out against China's crackdown on minorities when he met with President Jiang in Crawford, Texas, in October. Mr. Bush publicly warned that """"no nation's efforts to counter terrorism should be used to justify suppressing minorities or silencing peaceful dissent."""" But now the administration must back up those words with action. Mr. Craner should tell China that the U.S. will work with other governments at the highest levels to push a resolution on China's dismal human-rights record at next year's annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. He should call on China to open up Xinjiang to international trial observers and to allow unrestricted access to U.N. and private human-rights experts.

She was charged with the """"crime"""" of """"running away with a boy,"""" a common allegation levied against girls and women in Afghanistan's prisons. After being married at age 15 to a man who beat her, Rana fled to another man's home, lived with him and bore a child. She later contacted her family, but her uncle decided to kill her for her infidelity. To protect her, Rana's mother turned her in to the police. Holding her 18-month-old baby, Rana told me she is afraid her family will kill her if she is released. In prison, she said, """"I am safe."""" No, this is not a story of women living under the Taliban, the most misogynistic regime the modern world has known. This is the reality that women and girls face today in post-Taliban Afghanistan. The common perception outside Afghanistan is that when the U.S.-led forces overthrew the Taliban, women and girls were liberated. The truth is somewhat different. Despite improvements in access to education and an end to the Taliban's ban on working outside the home, an array of Taliban-era restrictions on women remains in place. One of the worst places is the western province of Herat, ruled by local warlord Ismail Khan. For Herati women and girls, every decision, every day presents dangers or challenges from the government: where they can go, how they can get there, whom they can go with and how they can dress. Herat police now arrest women and girls found alone with men to whom they are not related -- even when walking in the street or riding alone with a taxi driver. The police then take them to the hospital for forced medical examinations to determine whether they have recently had sexual intercourse. Women in Herat still wear the all-enveloping burqa or chador. Government officials enforce this dress code by harassing women and girls on the street, at school and university, and at work. Freedom to work also is threatened. Ismail Khan has publicly chastised women for working for international organizations and imposed burdensome conditions on them. Officials of the United Nations and other international organizations say this makes it more difficult to administer aid programs to women. Many girls are back in school but must study separately from boys, even at Herat University. The few women studying law, journalism and engineering despair of being allowed to practice these professions. """"Only the doors to the schools are open. Everything else is restricted,"""" a 21-year-old Herati woman told me. Things are getting worse, not better. The few women and girls who have dared to challenge Khan's policies have been harshly intimidated. At a public meeting in Herat, one woman tried to read an article she had written stating that women have the same human rights as men, but government officials castigated her. She was badly shaken by the experience. Still in the ninth grade, trying to make up for time lost under the Taliban, she has all but lost hope: """"I think it is too late for me. The government will change but not in time for me."""" Conditions in the capital of Kabul are better, but resurgent Taliban-era restrictions are starting to sprout up even there. Government employees of a renamed """"Vice and Virtue"""" office have patrolled Kabul's streets in recent months to harass women wearing makeup and """"calling attention to themselves."""" Elsewhere, a girls' school in Sar-e Pol was recently burned down by a group formerly allied with the Taliban that now holds power in several districts. In Zabul province, troops have threatened men who allow their wives to teach or their daughters to attend school. Aid officials understand the problems, but not enough is being done to address them. Many U.N. and development agencies too readily accept culturally relative arguments about women and girls, somehow giving higher priority to tradition than rights. Some suggest that pushing too aggressively on women's rights in Afghanistan would be destabilizing and would cause a backlash. But no one is suggesting forcing women and girls to adopt norms they don't want. What is necessary is to allow women and girls in Afghanistan to make choices for themselves. More than a year after the Taliban's fall, it is time for the United States, United Nations and others to follow through on their rhetoric of change and freedom. More aid and technical assistance must be provided to Afghan women and girls who are working to articulate, demand and obtain their basic human rights, not just in Kabul but in the provinces as well. A first step is to make the protection of human rights a larger part of the U.N. mandate in Afghanistan. In addition, the Afghan government must protect those rights by changing the law: On the same day the government released 20 women in Kabul jailed for """"moral crimes,"""" Kabul's police chief vowed to keep arresting them. The outside world must lend material and moral support to Afghanistan's women so they can stand up to the male-dominated warlord culture all around them. So long as women continue to see prison as a better alternative to their lives in Afghanistan, the rest of the world should know it has failed.

Human Rights Watch said the long running Aceh conflict has been marked by serious human rights abuses on both sides. More than 10,000 people have been killed, including more than 1,300 in the past year alone. The agreement calls for a cessation of hostilities and mandates an immediate end to all acts of violence and unlawful arrests. """"This peace deal is welcome, but we are concerned by the absence of human rights provisions or even of the term 'human rights,' in the agreement,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The agreement won't stick without will on both sides to protect human rights and civilian lives.""""  Human Rights Watch said that the continuation of violence up to the signing of the agreement casts doubt on the will of the parties to make the agreement a success. Before the start of the annual Ramadan period in early November, GAM announced a unilateral cease-fire in anticipation of the signing of yesterday's agreement. However, the Indonesian military launched an offensive the next day, during which it laid siege to a major GAM base in Cot Trieng. GAM responded by violating its own cease-fire. Both sides sustained numerous casualties during this period.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern that the agreement includes no mechanism to ensure protection for human rights workers investigating abuses.  """"We are pleased that both parties have accepted the presence of monitors to report on the security situation, but there should also be an agreement on the role of both international and local human rights monitors, too,"""" said Adams. """"The ability of human rights workers to monitor the situation in Aceh after the signing of the peace agreement will be critical to making the agreement a success.""""  Recent weeks have seen the increased targeting of local human rights workers in Aceh. For example, Musliadi, a coordinator of the Coalition for West Aceh Students' Movement (KAGEMPAR) and a member of the Aceh Referendum Information Center, was abducted from the KAGEMPAR office in Banda Aceh on November 30 by six armed, plain-clothed men. His body was found four days later in Sibreh village, Aceh Besar District, floating in the river. His corpse had signs that he had been tortured. Several human rights groups, including the Aceh Legal Aid Office, have also reported an increase in intimidation against their staff.  Human Rights Watch said outside support and pressure will be critical for the peace agreement to succeed over the long term.  """"The international community must insist to both sides that they abide by the letter and spirit of the agreement, commit to a lasting cease-fire, and ensure the protection of basic human rights,"""" said Adams. """"Only with these protections will the provincial elections called for in 2004 be a success.""""  Human Rights Watch also called on donors such as Japan, who are pledging assistance for reconstruction in Aceh, to use their influence with the Indonesian government and GAM to insist on independent human rights monitoring and respect for the rule of law as conditions for development aid. Human Rights Watch also suggested that embassies in Jakarta, particularly those of ASEAN countries, regularly send their representatives to Aceh to monitor the situation and make clear their support for human rights workers.  Human Rights Watch commended the announcement today in Aceh by a spokesman for the Indonesian army that government troops would cease all military operations in the province and return to barracks. Any lasting peace agreement will require the armed forces of both sides to withdraw and end attacks on soldiers and civilians alike.

The 94-page report, """"By Invitation Only: Australian Asylum Policy,"""" is based on eight months of investigation and challenges the Australian government's policy on asylum seekers as a breach of the country's international obligations to protect refugees. """"These people are not 'queue jumpers' -many are refugees in need of protection who have been failed by the system at every stage,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"They should not be treated differently from the refugees Australia invites to resettle from refugee camps overseas."""" Human Rights Watch found that many asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran were still at risk in the countries through which they passed - such as Jordan or Indonesia - and were unable to access the offices of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees or foreign embassies to apply for resettlement. Human Rights Watch's evidence shows that the Australian Defence Forces violated the rights of asylum seekers on board boats intercepted in October 2001. They detained the single men under inhumane conditions, beat several of them with batons and used other unnecessary force against vulnerable refugee families. These findings contradict the report of the Australian Senate Select Committee on a Certain Maritime Incident [issued on October 23, 2002] that praised the humanitarian conduct of the naval operations. Unlike the Senate Committee, which could not collect refugee testimony, Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of refugees present during the naval operations. After being refused entry to Australia, the intercepted asylum seekers were sent to the Pacific states of Nauru and Papua New Guinea, where they have been arbitrarily detained and have had no access to legal assistance or an independent appeal body to re-examine their claims. Other asylum seekers have been warehoused in camps in Indonesia. The Human Rights Watch report criticizes Australia's so-called """"Pacific Solution"""" by highlighting serious failings in the protection available to refugees and asylum seekers in these three countries. Human Rights Watch urged the Australian government to resettle those who remain in the Pacific detention centers and to refrain from forcing rejected asylum seekers back to countries where conditions do not allow for return in safety and dignity. Human Rights Watch warned that asylum seekers detained in the newly built facility on Christmas Island are likely to face the same abuses - arbitrary detention, lack of due process in asylum procedures and denial of family reunification. Christmas Island, an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean, was """"excised"""" by the government last year, meaning that the right to apply for protection in Australia has been removed from any asylum seeker who arrives there. Human Rights Watch also appealed to the Australian government not to force refugees it had already accepted to re-apply for asylum when their current visas (called """"Temporary Protection Visas"""") expire. Such a policy is contrary to all accepted state practice and to UN guidance on reserving Temporary Protection for use in mass influx situations. If the Australian Department of Immigration insists on reassessing their status, Human Rights Watch believes that individual refugees should at least be given a fair chance to explain why they were not safe in a country nearer to home or en route to Australia. Under Australian law, the mere fact that they spent more than seven days in a country deemed to be safe before arriving in Australia, or that there were offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in a country through which they passed, may be used as grounds for denying them important human rights. Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR to tell the Australian government and people in plain terms that its presence in transit countries such as Jordan or Indonesia is no substitute for the protection that should be offered by states. """"Australia's handling of these refugees is even more shameful when you learn the dangers they faced on the way here,"""" said Mungoven. """"You can't say one group of refugees is more deserving than another, just because of how they arrived. That's the Australian government's game, but it's not international law."""" This is the first full report ever issued on Australia by Human Rights Watch, an international monitoring group based in New York. Human Rights Watch has issued some 1,100 reports since 1978 on systematic human rights violations in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Americas. Many of these reports have documented violations of the rights of refugees and internally displaced persons around the world.","Asia, Australia",""

Human Rights Watch asked that both death sentences be commuted to life in prison.""""The execution of these two men on a day that is set aside to celebrate human rights shows how out of step the United States is with the rest of the world on the death penalty,"""" said Wendy Patten, U.S. advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. The two men scheduled to be executed on December 10 are Desmond Carter and Jerry McCracken, both age 35. Carter was convicted for the murder of an elderly neighbor and is set to die by lethal injection in North Carolina. McCracken, who was convicted of four murders, is scheduled to be put to death in Oklahoma. Serious questions persist regarding the fairness of the death penalty systems in North Carolina and Oklahoma. A study by the North Carolina Council of Churches concluded that racial factors played a large role in determining who received death sentences, finding that defendants who murdered white victims were 3.5 times more likely to be sentenced to death than those who killed black victims. Defendants in North Carolina also confront a lack of qualified court-appointed counsel to handle their cases. According to a recent study by the Common Sense Foundation, a North Carolina policy group, one out of every six death row inmates was represented at trial by lawyers who were, at some time, disciplined by the North Carolina State Bar. After a lengthy hearing on December 4, a state court judge stayed Carter's execution and ordered a hearing to consider claims of racial bias and inadequate representation, but the state Supreme Court overturned the judge's ruling and lifted the stay in a cursory opinion issued on December 6. Inadequate legal representation has also plagued Oklahoma's death penalty system. Oklahoma has one of the highest execution rates in the country, with 0.145 executed per 10,000 people. In 2001, Oklahoma executed more prisoners than any other state. Numerous capital defendants in Oklahoma have been represented by court-appointed lawyers who failed to present witnesses and mitigation evidence and, in some instances, failed to make opening statements. """"These cases highlight problems endemic to the death penalty, including racial bias and lack of adequate representation,"""" said Ms. Patten. """"Many U.S. states continue to carry out death sentences despite serious concerns about fairness."""" Human Rights Watch continues to urge the abolition of the death penalty in the 38 U.S. states that retain it. Human Rights Watch is especially concerned about the execution of juvenile offenders. The United States continues to apply the death penalty to children in clear violation of international law. In the past three years, only the United States, Congo and Iran have executed juvenile offenders - children under 18 at the time they committed the crime - and the latter two countries have since explicitly repudiated the practice. In 2002, only the United States is known to have put child offenders to death, with three such executions in Texas this year. Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances. The death penalty is a form of punishment unique in its cruelty and finality. The intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons may be executed.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

Since November 29, the police have conducted three large raids and dozens of arbitrary arrests against refugees from Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo in several neighborhoods of Nairobi. In the largest group arrest on November 29 at approximately 8:00 pm, 20 Kenyan police officers began house-to-house arrests in Kawangware, a so-called slum neighborhood to the southwest of Nairobi. More than 50 refugees were arrested, and some described being beaten during the arrests. All were pushed into two waiting trucks, among them Sudanese and Congolese refugees, including children. Several other refugees avoided arrest by paying bribes to the police. Among those arrested were two Congolese refugee women with UNHCR-issued documents granting them permission to remain in Nairobi for security reasons. They were waiting for resettlement to a third country, which was necessary because they were judged to be in danger in Kenya.  """"Refugees in Kenya are often at risk because of potential violence from criminal elements. It turns out they are also under threat from the Kenyan police who should be protecting refugees, not abusing them,"""" said Alison Parker, a refugee expert and author of Human Rights Watch's recent report on abuses against refugees living in Nairobi and Kampala.  """"Refugees are also vulnerable to violence at the hands of 'security' agents from their home countries,"""" Parker said.  All 54 Sudanese and Congolese refugees spent the night in a 40-by-30 meter cell at the Muthangari station in Nairobi. Conditions were deplorable, according to a UNHCR official who visited the station. One Congolese refugee woman was arrested along with her child, and she counted some eight other children who were detained along with their mothers. Refugee women were also forced to clean the jail during their time in detention. UNHCR was not allowed access to the refugees until midday on November 30, when the documented refugees were released. Some of the Sudanese refugees remain in detention.  The recent round of arrests is just the latest example where the Kenyan police have committed rights violations against refugees. Police at the Muthangari station told UNHCR officials that the Mombassa crimes were the rationale for the crackdown, but the authorities have made no official link between the Mombassa attacks and this group of detained refugees in Nairobi. To our knowledge, no refugee was charged with criminal acts or terrorist-related activities.  """"Acts of violence, however terrible, never justify a government roundup of refugees. Kenya will not help improve its international image by scapegoating marginal groups such as refugees,"""" Parker said.  Similar crackdowns against refugees occurred in September 1998, in October 2001, twice in February 2001, and in May 2002. In the aftermath of the Mombassa attacks and in the lead-up to Kenya's elections later this month, Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan police to stop arbitrarily arresting and detaining refugees and otherwise violating their human rights.","Africa, Kenya","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

A 12-page briefing paper, """"Afghanistan's Bonn Agreement: A Catalog of Missed Opportunities,"""" released today by Human Rights Watch, analyzes conditions in the country one year after the agreement that formalized the end of the Taliban's rule. The briefing paper outlines a number of areas in which the Afghan government and international actors have missed opportunities to improve security and protect human rights. Human Rights Watch makes several recommendations to international and Afghan actors to help realize key provisions in the agreement. The Bonn Agreement was signed on December 5, 2001 by representatives of several different anti-Taliban factions and political groups. It established a roadmap and timetable for establishing peace and security, reconstructing the country, reestablishing some key institutions, and protecting human rights. The agreement contains provisions addressing military demobilization and integration, international peacekeeping, and human rights monitoring. """"One year later, the Bonn Agreement still embodies Afghanistan's best chance for putting an end to chronic instability, violence and a history of massive human rights abuses,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Yet many of the agreement's promises have not been fulfilled in the last year. The international community has missed several good opportunities to sideline local military rulers and to better promote security and the protection of human rights."""" Human Rights Watch noted that little progress has been made in establishing better security and protection of human rights outside the capital, Kabul. Currently, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the international peacekeeping force for Afghanistan, is only stationed in and around Kabul. The United States and United Kingdom promised recently to deploy small numbers of troops in enclaves in other parts of the nation. Human Rights Watch said that a greater international military presence is needed to establish security throughout the country to protect ordinary Afghans.  Human Rights Watch also noted that no serious efforts have been made to demobilize and integrate Afghanistan's military in the last year. Human Rights Watch called on nations involved in security issues in Afghanistan, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and the Netherlands, to place more emphasis on disarmament and demobilization efforts, and to devote more forces and monitors to the task. Human Rights Watch welcomed President Hamid Karzai's announcement of new plans for demobilization and establishment of a national army and the news that the government of Japan plans to assist in monitoring future disarmament efforts.  Human Rights Watch also urged the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to increase human rights monitors in Afghanistan and publish more reports about human rights conditions within the country. """"Many of the difficulties in the last year in implementing the Bonn Agreement are the result of the disastrous state of Afghanistan's civil and governmental institutions after two decades of war,"""" said Adams. """"But Afghanistan's warlords are primarily to blame for sabotaging the agreement. The international community is also at fault for not providing the necessary assistance to those Afghans who are trying to make the agreement a success."""" Human Rights Watch said that much had been accomplished in the last year in reestablishing institutions and general reconstruction in Afghanistan, but noted that many Afghans are disillusioned with the lack of political progress. The June loya jirga (grand council), which reappointed President Hamid Karzai as president of Afghanistan, was marked by threats and abuses by military commanders and warlords.  """"Afghanistan is a long way away from meeting conditions for free and fair elections, called for in 2004 by the Bonn Agreement,"""" Adams said. """"But there is still time for the Afghan government, with greater help from the international community, to get things on track."""" Human Rights Watch made a number of recommendations in the briefing paper, including: ISAF should be expanded as soon as possible. The United States, EU nations, Iran, Pakistan, Central Asian states, and other nations involved in Afghanistan should assist in all efforts to expand ISAF. The United States and its coalition partners should offer necessary assistance to enable future ISAF expansion, including supplying necessary intelligence, logistical support, and assistance in emergency evacuations. Germany and the Netherlands should take the lead in lobbying other nations to contribute troops to an expanded ISAF when they take command of ISAF in early 2003. Donors and nations involved in security issues should fully support President Karzai's plans for military demobilization and integration and creation of an Afghan national army. The United States and other nations with a military presence in Afghanistan should stop arming regional and local military commanders or allow such forces to seize discovered arms caches. All outside states should cease the provision of arms, ammunition, equipment, funds and other material support to regional and local military commanders. All military assistance should go through the Ministry of Defense in Kabul in a coordinated manner. UNAMA should substantially increase its human rights monitoring presence around the country to act as both a deterrent and to help break Afghanistan's cycle of impunity. UNAMA should create a trust fund for human rights to finance this initiative. Donors should offer appropriate training, seconding of staff, all necessary financial support, and strong political support to the National Human Rights Commission. The National Human Rights Commission should expand monitoring efforts and issue reports and findings in areas in which it can safely operate.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The waiver opens the way for the indictment of the former dictator and his extradition from Senegal, where he lives in exile, if Belgian politicians vote to retain that country's long-arm anti-atrocity statute. Habré, labeled an """"African Pinochet,"""" was indicted in Senegal two years ago on charges of torture and crimes against humanity before the Senegalese courts ruled that he could not be tried there. Chadian victims then filed charges against him in Belgium. The president of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, has said that he would extradite Habré to Belgium if a request were made. Human rights groups applauded the Chadian move, saying that it was the first time that a country had waived the immunity of a former president to permit criminal human rights charges in another country. """"This waiver is a clear green light for Habre's prosecution,"""" said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch, which helped the victims file the case. """"We are one step closer to the day when Habré will have to answer in a court of law for his terrible crimes."""" In a letter to the Belgian judge investigating the charges against Habré, Chad's justice minister Djimnain Koudj-Gaou wrote, """"Mr. Hissène Habré can not claim to enjoy any form of immunity from the Chadian authorities"""" The document, dated October 7, 2002, was given today to Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH), which immediately made it public. In February and March, the Belgian judge, Daniel Fransen, visited Chad with a police team to investigate the charges against Habré. The judge visited Habré-era prisons and mass grave sites and interviewed victims as well as many of Habré's collaborators. The investigation has since been put on hold, however, as Belgian courts, in cases involving Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Ivoirian President Laurent Gbagbo, restricted the scope of the anti-atrocity to cases in which the accused is already in Belgium. The Belgian parliament is now considering two laws to overturn those decisions and restore the law's longer reach. The Chadian government letter resolves the legal question of state immunity. In a decision this February on a Belgian arrest warrant for the then-foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) said that certain high-ranking officials enjoyed """"immunity of jurisdiction"""" from prosecution before the courts of another state. The ICJ left open the question of immunity for former office-holders. The Chadian waiver makes that point moot, however, since under international law the immunity belongs to the state and not to the official. Chadian activists also hailed the waiver. """"For the first time, the Chadian government has committed itself to bring about justice and fighting impunity,"""" said Dobian Assingar, president of the Chadian League for Human Rights and vice-president of the FIDH, stated. """"We welcome this stand, but we will remain vigilant to see how this plays out."""" Twice before, governments have waived the immunity of former presidents to face human rights charges abroad, but these were for civil suits in United States. One was the case of Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, the other Prosper Avril of Haiti Hissène Habré ruled the former French colony of Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by current President Idriss Déby and fled to Senegal. His one-party regime, marked by widespread atrocities, was backed by the United States and France as a bulwark against Moemmar Khadaffi of Libya. Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States gave covert CIA paramilitary support to help Habré take power and later provided Habré with massive military aid and gave training and support to the his security forces. Habré launched several campaigns against ethnic groups such as the Sara (1984), the Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989), killing and arresting leaders and extended families and even destroying whole communities when he perceived that the groups were hostile to his regime.

An estimated 1,000 people have died and more than 100,000 have been displaced since violence between Christians and Muslims broke out in the Poso region of Central Sulawesi in December 1998.  The 48-page report, Breakdown: Four Years of Communal Violence in Central Sulawesi, says security forces have turned a blind eye to violence committed by both sides, including attacks by the Laskar Jihad militia. Human Rights Watch warned that shootings, bombings and attacks continue with impunity, putting at risk a peace declaration signed a year ago.  """"Some western governments want to strengthen ties with the Indonesian military in the fight against terrorism, but the army cannot even control conflict in many parts of the country,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia division at Human Rights Watch. """"This problem cannot be fixed by more weapons and training. The focus should be on reform.""""  Following a fight between youths four years ago, Muslim and Christian groups mounted attacks on each other's neighborhoods and villages in repeated cycles of violence. Security forces failed to stop the attacks, and when they did act, they sometimes worsened conditions by firing into crowds and committing human rights violations. Many of the worst crimes went unpunished, and several subsequent outbreaks were tied to the lack of arrests for prior violence. The few trials that did take place produced inconsistent sentences and took place in a circus-like atmosphere that inflamed tensions further, Human Rights Watch said. An effective and unbiased deployment of police or military, with a justice system that could hold perpetrators accountable, could have ended the problem when it began in 1998, Human Rights Watch said. International attention has focused on Indonesia's cooperation in the fight against terrorism, particularly since the bombing in Bali on October 12 of this year. """"Terrorist networks in Indonesia indeed require urgent attention by authorities,"""" said Adams. """"But Indonesia's regional conflicts pose a more direct threat to democratization and peace. And local conflicts create the chaos and radicalization that terrorist networks seek out."""" An al-Qaeda training camp was allegedly set up in the Poso area. The Human Rights Watch report describes how the radical Muslim organization Laskar Jihad, which had formed to join a similar conflict in Maluku to the east, arrived in Poso in July 2001. They met with local officials and were welcomed by Muslims who felt police and army units had failed to protect them. The arrival of a well-armed, experienced fighting force was followed by the destruction of Christian villages in late 2001. Although the scale of violence fell after the signing of the Malino Declaration in December 2001, the militia's decision to remain in Poso became a sticking point in the peace process. As pressure on Muslim radicals grew in the days following the explosion on Bali, Laskar Jihad announced that it was disbanding. They asserted the decision had been made for internal reasons days before the attack, which has not been linked to the group. Soon after, another group called the Islam Defenders Front (Front Pembela Islam, FPI) made a similar announcement in Jakarta. Leaders of both groups had already been charged with crimes, and observers said widely-alleged support from elements in the army was fading. """"The announcement by the radical Muslim militia Laskar Jihad that it is disbanding makes this a critical time for peace in Poso and throughout Indonesia,"""" said Adams. """"The government must demonstrate through credible investigations and prosecutions that violence by militias or their former members is unacceptable."""" Observers worry that former militia members will not simply return to their home villages. Many have been become radicalized, experienced fighters during years of conflict. There are also other militias throughout the country that have not disbanded, some of them tied to political parties. If the government acts now to hold perpetrators of organized violence accountable, while clarifying the legal basis for banning paramilitary groups, widespread violence may be reduced during the next election cycle in 2004. Human Rights Watch called for an investigation by Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission into the failure to contain the violence in Poso, and urged that internationally-supported training programs build the capacity of police in the province, including measures to increase accountability for human rights violations.","Asia, Indonesia",""

On November 28, Judge Nizamiddin Rustamov sentenced Iskandar Khudoiberganov to death, ignoring the testimony by Khudoiberganov and two witnesses that their confessions and incriminating statements were coerced under torture. Judge Rustamov stated in court that his verdict would rely exclusively on these confessions and statements. “The death penalty in all cases is wrong, and it is all the more horrifying to see a man condemned to death on the basis of words beaten out of him,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “Torture allegations are all too common in Uzbekistan, and the authorities simply don’t investigate them.”  The verdict came at a time of increased international focus on Uzbekistan, including by the United Nations, whose Special Rapporteur on Torture was conducting a fact-finding mission to the country.  Khudoiberganov, 28, was arrested in 2001 in Tajikistan and extradited to Uzbekistan on February 5, 2002. He was tried together with five other defendants at the Tashkent Municipal Court. The defendants were accused of organizing a criminal group to propagate religious “extremism.” Khudoiberganov was also charged with terrorism and murder and was accused of having been trained in military camps in Chechnya and Tajikistan. The evidence in the trial, however, relied pivotally on written testimonies by defendants and witnesses who later retracted them in court.  Human Rights Watch attended Khudoiberganov’s trial, and heard him testify in court that he was beaten in the basement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs building. Individuals close to the case told Human Rights Watch that in February the police also administered electric shocks to Khudoiberganov and that since February 12 he was held at the National Security Service, where officers beat him, deprived him of sleep, and drugged him with injections, including during the trial. Other defendants testified in court that police had beaten them with batons and suffocated them with plastic bags and gas masks in order to coerce confessions.  Some of the torture claims were supported in court by Khudoiberganov’s wife, sister and father, who witnessed the torture at the Tashkent Municipal Police Department. His father, Erkin Khodoiberganov, said that in 1999 he had been detained, together with another son, Sanjar, in order to compel Iskandar Khudoiberganov’s appearance for questioning. Erkin Khudoiberganov testified in court that police tortured Bekzod Kasimbekov, a co-defendant: “A policeman brought me to Bekzod. They put a gas mask on him and started torturing him. He was shouting, crying. I have never heard such a sound coming from a human being.” Khudoberganov further testified that the police threatened “to do the same thing to me and my son” should he fail to turn in Iskandar.  Two other witnesses who had provided police with incriminating statements retracted them in court, claiming they had been coerced under torture. They are currently serving prison terms.  Throughout the trial, Judge Rustamov dismissed all allegations of torture in the case. In response to the testimony of another defendant, Nosir Khokimov, who described police torture that he witnessed, Judge Rustamov complained, “You are just telling us about torture, and not about your crimes.” In another exchange, when Khudoiberganov was describing torture marks that he saw on one of his co-defendants, the judge said that the Ministry of Internal Affairs, where the torture allegedly occurred, “is not a holiday resort.”  The codefendants were sentenced to between six and 16 years in prison.  Torture in custody is widespread in Uzbekistan. In the past two years, Human Rights Watch has documented 12 deaths arising from suspicious circumstances in custody, and has received numerous credible reports about other torture incidents.  The verdict came at a time when the international community has been seeking to justify its increased engagement with Uzbekistan in the global campaign against terrorism, despite the country’s poor human rights record. The Bush administration has credited Uzbekistan with making progress in accountability for torture, but today’s verdict undermined that claim, Human Rights Watch said.  In August, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell reported to the U.S. Congress that Uzbekistan was making “substantial and continuing progress” in the field of human rights and democracy, allowing the release of additional monetary assistance to the Uzbek government. The report cited convictions of seven officers in two torture-related deaths, but made no mention of the many other deaths and countless cases of torture that remain without remedy. The U.S. State Department also hailed the visit of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture to Uzbekistan as a success of U.S. engagement in Uzbekistan, without waiting to evaluate the level of cooperation on the part of the Uzbek authorities during the visit. The Special Rapporteur began a two-week mission to investigate torture in the country on November 24.  “While the United States is claiming Uzbekistan’s human rights record is improving, the Uzbeks are condemning a man to death on the basis of confessions extracted under torture,” said Andersen. “Convicting a handful of officers isn’t enough to show sustained progress. The failure to investigate these torture claims, even while the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture is in the country, shows that the authorities remain indifferent.”  In what appeared to be an attempt to appease the United States in this case, the verdict, which the judge read in court, makes repeated reference to Osama Bin Laden, claiming that Khudoiberganov met with Bin Laden in Afghanistan and that they discussed the situation in Uzbekistan. No witnesses presented evidence about such a meeting during the trial, nor was Khudoiberganov questioned at trial about such a meeting.  The day before the verdict, Jean Lemierre, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development was in Uzbekistan to discuss the bank’s forthcoming annual meeting, which is to take place in Tashkent in May 2003. This year, 55 nongovernmental organizations challenged the bank to press the Uzbek government for specific human rights improvements as a condition for the 2003 meeting, arguing that failure to do so would grant the Uzbek government undeserved political prestige and financial benefit.  Also this week, the European Union is scheduled to discuss Uzbekistan within the framework of its Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with the country, which makes respect for human rights a condition for engagement. Human Rights Watch called on the international community to condemn the conduct of the trial, and to ask the Uzbek authorities to thoroughly investigate the torture allegations and to void the judgment on account of evidence coerced under torture.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

While everyone is aware of that, it is nevertheless good to re-iterate it often, and to integrate it into your thinking and into whatever language is adopted on the issues before you. Above all, the Convention is aimed at minimizing harm to civilians from warfare and weaponry. This is both a noble ideal and a legal obligation. It is regrettable that the CCW is best known for what many States in this room called the outright failure of the negotiations on antipersonnel mines in 1995 and 1996. The CCW is in fact an important international instrument dealing with dum-dum bullets, incendiary weapons, antivehicle mines and blinding lasers. But States Parties have before them now a grand opportunity -- an opportunity to show that the CCW is a live and growing convention that is responsive to global humanitarian needs. An effective new protocol dealing with all aspects of explosive remnants of war could be the greatest CCW achievement, one that might make the most significant difference in protecting civilians and saving lives. We implore governments to seize this moment in time and make the most of it. Do not repeat the mistakes of 1995 and 1996 and make the least of it. In saying that, we don't mean that negotiations have to be aimed at banning any new class or classes of weapons, but they must be aimed at new rules, regulations and restrictions that will have a truly meaningful impact on the ground, that will make a real difference to war-affected communities. It is our hope that you will walk away from the next two weeks with a clear mandate to begin immediate negotiations on a new legally binding instrument that addresses all aspects of explosive remnants of war. We might as well start calling it Protocol 5. You should challenge yourselves to complete negotiations in one year's time, as would be appropriate to the humanitarian imperative. There is the added advantage that with respect to ERW, military interests and humanitarian needs largely coincide and are reinforcing. Human Rights Watch believes that the negotiations should address both preventive and remedial measures, and should address both generic and weapons-specific issues. We would much prefer that a dual track approach would mean fast-track negotiations on the remedial and generic measures, and perhaps necessarily slower track negotiations for the more complicated weapons-specific issues - but negotiate rather than merely discuss these more difficult matters, as is currently envisioned. The ERW mandate would be strengthened by delineating the types of remedial measures that are to be the subject of negotiations. It is important that these include not just clearance, but also advance warnings to civilian populations, and the rapid provision of relevant information to clearance and risk assessment professionals. They should also include victim assistance. These remedial measures are essential, and will be easier to agree on, but preventive measures must not be ignored. Ultimately, preventive measures are likely to offer greater protection to civilian populations, saving the most lives and limbs, while also being the most cost-effective when one factors in not just the cost of clean-up, but the human toll and the socio-economic costs of ERW. Preventive measures should include technical approaches, mainly aimed at reducing the failure rate of munitions, as well as targeting issues. Assessments of recent conflicts have shown that new targeting restrictions are needed to better protect civilians, particularly with regard to use in or near populated areas. It is important that special attention be paid to explosive submunitions, or cluster bombs as they are commonly known. We have ample evidence from numerous conflicts, most recently Afghanistan, that cluster bombs pose grave dangers to civilian populations both during strikes - due to the wide footprint and lack of accuracy - and after the attack due to the large number of explosive duds inevitably left behind. Human Rights Watch has a new report on cluster bomb use in Afghanistan to share with delegates. If States Parties choose not to address cluster bombs in a meaningful fashion, then their efforts of the past year and the coming year are likely to be viewed by the general public as a humanitarian cop-out, with governments doing the easy, but avoiding the hard. This may or may not prove to be an accurate assessment, but it is likely to be the public relations reality. For its part, Human Rights Watch hopes to be able to engage constructively with States Parties in the coming weeks and years to bring about the most effective humanitarian law possible. In closing, I would like to note that today is the fifth anniversary of the opening for signature of the Mine Ban Treaty in Ottawa, Canada. Nearly every government in this room is a State Party to that treaty, which provides the only viable framework for eradicating antipersonnel mines. We wish you all a happy anniversary. Thank you.","Global","Arms, Cluster Munitions, Landmines"

In recent weeks, the United States has taken a number of steps towards that end. The U.S. has indicted top leaders of Colombia's paramilitary and guerrilla organizations implicated in grave human rights abuses as well as drug trafficking. It has suspended the U.S. visa of Colombian Admiral Rodrigo Quiñones, who has been repeatedly linked to serious abuses, leading to Quiñones' resignation as Colombia's military attache to Israel. And it has suspended assistance to a Colombian air force unit implicated in a serious violation of the laws of war that was never properly investigated. These actions have sent a welcome message that Colombia must fully and finally break remaining ties between its armed forces and paramilitary groups, and that its armed forces and law enforcement institutions must pursue and prosecute paramilitaries and guerrillas with equal vigor. Secretary of State Powell should reinforce that message to President Álvaro Uribe and to the Colombian armed forces by stressing that U.S. military assistance to Colombia can only be maintained if Colombia wages its struggle against armed groups within the rule of law. In particular, Secretary Powell should express concern about the record of Colombian Attorney General Luis Camilio Osorio, who has sought to undermine investigations by Colombian prosecutors of ties between senior military officers and paramilitaries. In the sixteen months since Osorio took office, at least twenty-six prosecutors and investigators working on such sensitive cases have been fired or forced to resign; many had received training from the United States. Finally, Secretary Powell should also stress that if the Colombian government engages in peace negotiations with the paramilitaries or the guerrillas, it should not offer amnesties to combatants who have committed atrocities against Colombian civilians.","Americas, Colombia","International Justice"

The Ukrainian parliament is scheduled to hold hearings on Wednesday, December 4 on political censorship, in response to growing outrage among journalists and media monitoring groups over violations of freedom of expression. In the letter to the parliament, Human Rights Watch summarized its research on secret memoranda, known as temniki (from the Russian phrase temi nedeli, [themes of the week]), that the presidential administration distributes to editors of the country’s main television stations. These weekly memoranda provide clear instructions about which topics should be covered and how they should be presented in news broadcasts. Human Rights Watch found that the directives eliminate balanced reporting and manipulate the news, allowing for only one, pro-presidential perspective to dominate television broadcasting, the most widely used news medium in Ukraine.  “The secret memoranda make for subtle but very effective censorship,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “They are a clear violation of freedom of expression and are antithetical to the rule of law.”  Television stations that fail to comply with the presidential administration’s directives may face court challenges, arbitrary tax inspections, and license withdrawals. Journalists face harassment, salary cuts, demotions and dismissal.  In this intimidating atmosphere, the presidential administration’s memoranda prevent television editors from making and implementing a balanced editorial policy, and journalists regularly practice self-censorship and present objective news only at great risk. As a result, Ukrainian news reporting is bland, biased in favor of the president, and uniform across television stations.  “Freedom of information is essential to the functioning of a democracy,” said Andersen. “At present, millions of viewers in Ukraine are denied access to information about important political, social and economic developments.” “A certain degree of pluralism has emerged in Ukraine’s media since the Soviet era, particularly in print and Internet resources,” Andersen said. “But with only a few exceptions, truly independent media do not exist.” In recent years, major industrial interests formed political parties and purchased media outlets. These patrons use their media holdings as a mouthpiece for personal or group interests and opinions, making objective reporting in any one source rare. Economic instability has forced the majority of media outlets to accept sponsorship from these groups in exchange for protection and financial security. Financial-political groups close to President Kuchma now dominate the six national television stations, and this, combined with the appearance of the temniki, has further eroded editorial and journalistic pluralism.  Informal censorship is the latest in a long series of threats to media freedom in Ukraine in recent years, which received broad domestic and international attention after the “disappearance” and murder of opposition journalist Georgy Gongadze in September 2000. The Gongadze case and similar cases involving the murder of journalists continue to remain unsolved. In October of this year, the Kyiv Court of Appeals brought criminal charges against Kuchma in connection with the Gongadze murder, based on tape recordings of a meeting at which the president allegedly asked security officials to “take care” of the journalist.

""""The outcome of the appeal confirms that the trial was unfair and the verdict unsound,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"These trials were politically motivated from the outset and riddled with procedural irregularities. They should never have taken place."""" Human Rights Watch called on the Egyptian government to permit Ibrahim to travel abroad for medical treatment and to rescind the closure orders that have shut down the Ibn Khaldun Center and the Hoda Association since June 2000.  Tuesday's decision marked the second time in less than a year that the Court of Cassation threw out a Supreme State Security Court conviction of Ibrahim and his co-defendants on charges of accepting foreign funds without authorization, disseminating false information about Egypt, and fraud. Egyptian law requires that a third trial on the same charges must now be heard by the Court of Cassation itself. Ibrahim has been released and the three other defendants who were serving prison sentences are expected to be released shortly.  In both trials, the defendants had no right of appeal against the substance of the charges leveled against them, and could only appeal on points of law or procedure. A third trial, in which the Court of Cassation will for the first time consider the merits of the state's charges against Ibrahim and the others, is scheduled to open on January 7, 2003.  Following the second conviction, handed down on July 29, 2002, Ibrahim received a seven-year prison term. Nadia 'Abd al-Nour, chief accountant at the Ibn Khaldun Center, received a two-year prison term on the fraud charge. Two others convicted on separate forgery and bribery charges, had their original five-year prison terms reduced to three years. The remaining 24 defendants all received suspended sentences and were released. Human Rights Watch called on Egyptian authorities to return Ibrahim's passport to him and allow him to seek treatment abroad.

But the Gates Foundation's generous support may be undone by factors that neither the government of India nor its donors are addressing: the voicelessness of women and increasing violence against those most affected by the epidemic.   The Indian government clings to the idea that the epidemic is limited to such """"high-risk groups"""" as sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men and that targeting these groups with information about condoms and how AIDS is transmitted is the best strategy to contain the epidemic.     Yet this no longer reflects the reality of AIDS, at least for the Indian states where it is in the general population. In these states, women who have sex only with their husbands may be the group at highest risk of HIV transmission.     The long-standing subordination of women and girls in Indian society takes on lethal dimensions with the rapid spread of HIV. Though men can experiment with sex outside of marriage without any social stigma, women do not even have the status to demand that husbands who may bring sexually transmitted diseases home use condoms.     Many Indian women are experiencing what their African sisters have known for years: that being left a widow by a man who dies from AIDS is a ticket to abandonment by his family and dire poverty and discrimination. And although they are a high-risk group for HIV transmission and the worst consequences of AIDS, most government programs ignore married women.     Even in those Indian states where the epidemic may still be contained among traditionally vulnerable groups, violence undermines HIV and AIDS programs. Prostitutes are continually subjected to violence by police officers, who take their cue from society's condemnation of these women. All of this stands to get worse as religious fundamentalism and the moral judgments that go with it increasingly become defining features of political power in India.     The violence of AIDS-related stigma also confronts AIDS educators, homosexual men and other marginalized people.     The most effective education on HIV transmission is done by those trusted by the community at risk. This means that sex workers have the best chance of helping other sex workers protect themselves from HIV. But peer education is not getting a fair chance in India. The police apparently do not recognize the lifesaving work done by AIDS educators, and these people face consistent abuse.     Finally, the Indian government and its well-meaning donors seem to think that HIV prevention alone can succeed, ignoring the needs of millions already living with HIV and AIDS. These people continue to face abuse and discrimination in the health-care system, and unless they are rich they can hardly hope for the basics of treatment of even secondary infections, let alone medicines for HIV itself.     India is one of the biggest producers of the drugs that have transformed the lives of people with AIDS in wealthy countries, yet millions of Indians cannot get these medicines.     The Gates Foundation can do India and its own investment a favor by insisting that the money be used to help the voiceless women with HIV and AIDS.    Meena Seshu, founder and general secretary of the organization Sangram, which works with sex workers and rural women in Sangli, India, was named a Human Rights Defender by Human Rights Watch.     Joanne Csete is director of the HIV/AIDS and human rights program at Human Rights Watch.","Asia, India","Health, Women's Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, Domestic Workers"

Their father is now living in Sydney. He fled from political persecution in Iraq in September 1999, first to Syria and then on to Australia. His wife did not hear from him for a full year during his journey to safety. Meanwhile, in his absence, the Iraqi authorities harassed Fatima as to his whereabouts. Her children were thrown out of school in Iraq. At this point she decided to flee with them to Jordan - the only land route out of Iraq not requiring a visa in advance. """"I was wealthy in my country, so why would I have left it only to find a job or a better life? I left because of the persecution,"""" she said.   Fatima stayed in Amman for only two weeks, during which period she received word that her husband had reached Australia. She called him and said she wanted to join him there. He told her not to attempt to come because the hazards of the sea voyages from Malaysia to the northern Australian islands were too great. Despite being a fully recognized refugee, he had been granted only a """"Temporary Protection Visa"""" which, in Australia, does not include the right to family reunion and so he had no way to bring his family to join him legally.   Fatima had a six-month visa in Jordan but saw no likelihood of the situation in Iraq changing within that time, so she thought, """"why should I waste my time waiting for my visa to expire in a country where I knew I wouldn't be allowed to stay for longer."""" She therefore arranged with a smuggler in Amman to go to Australia via Malaysia and Indonesia. It cost US$4000 in total for her and the four children.   They flew into Kuala Lumpur and stayed locked in a hotel room for ten days. She herself never left the room, the smuggler frightening her with the risk of arrest for being an illegal alien, but sometimes she sent her son out on quick errands.   Before leaving Malaysia, Fatima asked the smuggler many questions about the trip ahead. He told her not to be so anxious, that the trip would be easy, with medical staff on board the boats, for example. """"He told me women even have their babies on these boats."""" One evening (on or around June 15, 2001) he took them on buses to meet a third smuggler and the boats at the shore. When she saw the two tiny, rickety boats, she refused to board, but then was persuaded that they were just to shuttle them to a much larger boat, waiting out of sight. One smuggler finally threatened her children with a knife to make the family get on board.   After two hours at sea, with water lapping over the edges of the dingy that was overloaded with eleven people, the boat was intercepted by some Indonesian """"police or pirates, who threatened us with swords."""" Fatima was by this time so desperate to get herself and her children off the boat that she begged to be arrested, but the interceptors refused and demanded dollars. It took a six-hour negotiation and a collection from the pockets of all the refugee passengers to satisfy them and send them away.   Because the boat was skimming the shore to avoid detection, the passengers were being badly bitten by mosquitoes - their faces and arms swelling. Finally, in the pitch dark of 3 a.m., the smuggler dumped them all on a narrow channel, telling them that a bigger boat would collect them. He disappeared into the jungle. Stranded on the shore, Fatima """"tried to persuade the children to be brave but in fact I was thinking that nothing would now save us but God."""" The eleven refugees spent the night in the jungle, trying to hail other boats with fires, but whenever a fisherman came close and saw that they were Arabs, he would go away again. One fisherman agreed to take one of them back to the Malaysian mainland to find their """"head smuggler"""" or to get other help. They never saw this envoy again.   Waving dollars at the fishermen, they were finally rescued by another one. However, he said he would only take them three by three. Fatima went to find their bag for a moment, and when she came back she saw that her middle daughter was on the boat, along with two other refugees, and that the boat was sailing off into the distance. At this she was hysterical, not knowing where the fisherman was taking her child and whether he would ever return with her. After half an hour he came back with an empty boat and picked up Fatima and her two other daughters. The other refugees forced her to leave her son behind with them, so that the fisherman would feel compelled to come back another time.   Fatima did not know where they were going with this fisherman; she did not even know whether they were in Malaysia or Indonesia. After a while another boat started following them which the fisherman appeared to think was the police, so he quickly pulled over at another small island and forced them to disembark. So now Fatima and two of her daughters were stranded on this island, while one other daughter had been taken to an unknown destination and her son was still back on the island where they had spent the night. The fisherman signaled for Fatima and her daughters to head into the undergrowth and hide, and he himself followed them. The jungle was dense and Fatima led the way by hacking at vines with a shoe. They went deeper and deeper into the jungle and were soon lost. She was afraid of the fisherman somewhere behind them, believing he was going to rape her. They wandered in the jungle for hours, stumbling and cutting their hands, crying and screaming, with her trying to carry each child alternately. The fisherman, apparently still afraid that the police were following them, threatened them with a knife to be quiet. He held one daughter tight with the knife against her neck. Later he disappeared on his own into the jungle.   When Fatima found the shore again, she saw the fisherman's boat and he was nowhere to be seen. She tried to make it start by herself, to escape from the island, but they only got a few feet before the engine failed, so they all had to jump overboard and wade back to shore. Then the boat that had been following them came alongside the shore. It was not the Indonesian police, in fact, but another fisherman who tried to calm them. At this point Fatima collapsed and this new stranger carried her, along with the two girls, into his boat. When she awoke, she had no idea where they were going, but she saw that this man was """"merciful,"""" giving them fresh water and food.   Having left behind the only person who knew where her missing daughter had been taken, Fatima became distraught trying to explain the situation with hand gestures. She was able to make the man understand about her son and they returned to rescue him and the rest of the original refugee group. The fisherman then took them all home to his own house, but Fatima refused to get off the boat because she wanted to go back out and search for her middle daughter. Eventually the man and her son did go back out and, after an hour, returned with the missing girl. The whole family collapsed with relief as soon as they were reunited.   The family recuperated for three days at the house of this fisherman until a wealthier Malay man came to pick them up in his car and took them to his home. When he asked who they were, most of the refugees told the Malay man that they were Saudi tourists, but Fatima thought that was impossible to believe, with their torn clothes and faces swollen from stings and bites. She confessed the obvious: that she was a refugee. At this the gentleman offered to help take them back to Kuala Lumpur and Fatima telephoned the original smuggler, telling him everything that had happened and threatening to call the police if he did not help them now. Therefore, after two days at the Malay man's house, Fatima's family returned to the hotel in Kuala Lumpur, back where they had started.   Fatima realized that there was no way for them to go except forward, to Australia, but she begged the smuggler for a safer way to Indonesia. So this time a bigger ship was arranged, not overloaded - only twenty other asylum seekers were on board. After twelve hours they entered Indonesian waters, and the """"respectful"""" captain told them he would take them to Jakarta by land. They hid in the captain's home; police came to search the house but did not find them. They each paid US$250 to catch buses to Jakarta. She remembers that they still looked so sick and bedraggled that the officers at the bus station asked questions. She sensed that they were going to call the police and she warned the single men in her group of this. These men ran away before the police arrived and arrested the three remaining families with children, including Fatima's. She understood that they were going to be imprisoned but she was too tired to lie and explained that they were refugees trying to get to Australia.   The police left them in a small cell for one day before escorting them onto a ferry to Batam (a five hour trip). In Batam they were put into a detention center, locked behind iron bars, where they stayed for five months. There were about seventy people there, mostly Afghans and Iraqis. Her family was put with three others into one room, but the men were separated to another building - including her seventeen-year-old son. The men were always kept locked indoors and though she could see her son through the bars, she could not go to him, even when he fell sick. He has a rheumatic heart disease. """"We suffered there very much. The guards would put our children against the wall and throw knives around them for a game. The food was disgusting - just rice and a small piece of chicken every day. My weight fell from 96 to 81 kilos. We were not even given a fire to make tea. We slept on the ground."""" Only one member of the family was allowed to leave the center at a time, while the others were """"held hostage"""" until their return. There was no special treatment for children in the center. """"The children blamed me,"""" said Fatima, """"My youngest daughter asked me: 'What have I got from all this? I still have no school and I have not seen my father. I have been half a year in prison for wanting to find a school and my father.'""""   The family bribed the guards to make phone calls. By this means, Fatima was able to speak with her husband in Australia. He then tried to call the offices of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Jakarta on their behalf, calling several times a day. He told his wife that IOM knew they were there and, after one month, two representatives of IOM came to visit the detention center. [Fatima refused to answer questions about what these representatives told her, or to express an opinion about the services of IOM, because she feared it would hurt her chances of resettlement as a refugee.] IOM thereafter visited the center once a month, and representatives of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) visited them shortly after the first IOM visit. UNHCR, however, seems to have come to the detention center only to conduct interviews with Afghans on a certain list. Fatima cried and begged """"to get on their list"""" but they said """"they had no information about my family,"""" even though she is certain that she had told IOM she was seeking asylum. """"UNHCR said they could not help [with release] until you are recognized as refugees. UNHCR was surprised at the conditions, I think, but said IOM was responsible."""" UNHCR did, however, interview Fatima subsequently and her family was recognized as entitled to refugee status under the 1951 Refugee Convention.   After she was recognized as a refugee she knew that she had the right """"to be released from this nightmare"""" of the detention center, but she had to wait there for a further eleven days until IOM came to take her to Jakarta. IOM put the family in a hotel for five days and then told her that it would be up to her to find her own place, using the allowance paid to her by UNHCR. But the hotel was """"unsuitable for a single Muslim woman"""" because it was full of prostitutes and drug-dealing so that she left even earlier. An Indonesian organization contracted by UNHCR contacted an Iraqi refugee spokesman in Jakarta who managed to get Fatima an apartment in Cisawa - a town about an hour and a half from Jakarta. She and her children had lived there for five months as of May 2002.   The children had had no school for three years and getting them into a new school system was Fatima's priority. Australia, to which her case has been referred for resettlement by UNHCR, was dragging its heels, she believed. The last she heard was that Australia would send another selection mission to Indonesia in January 2002 (she has already been interviewed by Australian representatives once, in December 2001) but in May 2002 she was still waiting.   A few weeks before being interviewed by Human Rights Watch, Fatima was hit by a motorcycle but, because she had no-one to look after her children, she had to come straight home instead of staying in the hospital. She had eczema all over her body from nervous tension and had been misdiagnosed by an Indonesian doctor as having breast cancer. She joked that she would like to be sick if that would help her get resettled more quickly - not understanding that it might well have the opposite effect on her chances. Her thinking is that the survivors of the ship that sunk (""""SIEV X"""") were resettled quickly, proving that you have to """"almost die to get resettled.""""   Her happiness when first recognized as a refugee has soured with so much waiting in Indonesia, without school for her children. She has been consistently unable to get attention from UNHCR, she complained. When a Saudi tourist was stabbed by local Indonesians in the courtyard of their building, which made her worry that there would be other attacks on Arabs, UNHCR did not reply to her telephone calls and did nothing to re-house her someplace safer. """"I thought that the UN was a humanitarian organization. I still have not found the humanity. Why are the children guilty that they should be punished with this life?""""   Postscript: Shortly after Fatima met with Human Rights Watch, an Indonesian mob attacked 146 Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers and refugees living in Cisawa on April 20-21, 2002. Fatima was among a number of families with young children who fled from this violence into the fields and jungle, where they hid overnight. Fatima and her children were able to safely return to Cisawa the following day, when order was restored to the town. As of April 30, they remained there, waiting for resettlement.","Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Indonesia, Iraq",""

The daughter was raped three times. Later, the soldiers raped her mother five times. This incident, while it didn't happen in Iraq, should worry the United States if it decides to go to war there. This incident, while it didn't happen in Iraq, should worry the United States if it decides to go to war there. The attack happened last December near Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan. It was one of hundreds of killings, rapes, beatings and lootings that Human Rights Watch colleagues and I documented. What is particularly horrifying is that all of these crimes were committed not by the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but by local allies of the United States: troops of the Northern Alliance. War crimes committed by allies and foes during U.S. military interventions are an almost regular occurrence, as they are in most wars around the world. Former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic embarked on a massive killing spree against Kosovar Albanians when NATO began bombing. Afterward, Albanian militants began killing Serbian and Roma civilians suspected of collaborating with Milosevic, even while NATO was embracing these same militants as its partners in the new Kosovo. The potential conflict in Iraq again raises the danger that war crimes will be committed on a massive scale by both sides as they have been in the past — by Saddam Hussein and by the opposition Shiites and Kurds. That's why we are right to ask at this moment: Can the United States do more to stop its foes and its allies from committing war crimes? Absolutely. The United States must make it clear that friend or foe who commits serious abuses during a war in Iraq will be brought to justice. And then it must carry through on that threat. Afghanistan example In Afghanistan, for example, strong messages from the U.S. military to the Northern Alliance that serious abuses would not be tolerated had an impact. Territory changed hands without the massive massacres of civilians that had occurred twice in the 1990s. But after the fighting subsided, the Northern Alliance gambled that the United States and United Nations would not follow up their threats with actual justice, and they were right. Not a single Northern Alliance soldier has been prosecuted despite the many serious abuses we documented. The United States' failure to carry through on accountability in Afghanistan sends a dangerous message to the belligerents in Iraq. While the U.S. government's commitment to building a case against Saddam and members of his inner circle is an important step, to deter further atrocities, it must also pro mise to prosecute any war crimes committed by the opposition. Best approach Justice can be pursued in several ways, but it must respect the rights of the defendant and operate transparently so that the victims can witness justice being done. The military tribunals established by President Bush do not meet these basic principles. As in the Balkans, some form of ad-hoc international tribunal to try war criminals would have greater credibility and could work within an established framework of international criminal law. The ad-hoc Yugoslav tribunal, for example, has proved its impartiality by investigating and prosecuting abuses committed by all sides, exactly what may be needed in Iraq. In the long run, the United States should stop its self-absorbed opposition and support the International Criminal Court, which will come into being next spring and has the support of nearly 140 nations worldwide, including most of America's closest allies. That court is the most appropriate vehicle for ending impunity for war crimes. Even potential war criminals are calculating individuals. Knowing that they can get away with war crimes significantly affects their decisions. The rapists and murderers of the next conflict we face may very well reconsider their actions if prosecution is a realistic possibility down the line, rather than a comfortable retirement in the south of France. Unfortunately, U.S. actions to date have done little to give warlords around the world sleepless nights. ____**) Peter Bouckaert recently returned from an investigation in northern Iraq and has covered wars in Kosovo, Chechnya and Afghanistan, among others.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

International donors meeting in Geneva and regional leaders meeting in Dar es Salaam this week must apply maximum pressure to get the Burundian government and rebel forces to protect civilians and to agree to a ceasefire in the nine-year war, Human Rights Watch said. The recent movement of thousands of well-armed FDD combatants into northwestern Burundi have heightened fears of an all-out rebel attack on the capital, Bujumbura. A second and smaller rebel group, the National Liberation Forces, also occupies the hills around Bujumbura. The rebel forces are largely Hutu while a large number of Bujumbura residents are Tutsi.  The briefing paper also documents a series of army massacres of civilians since July, the worst of which killed at least 174 persons. Scores more were killed in five other military attacks. Most highly placed army officers are Tutsi; most of the victims in the killings are Hutu.  On November 22 and 23, the FDD bombarded heavily populated civilian neighborhoods of the capital, killing five persons and wounding others. Earlier in the month, they shelled the provincial capital of Gitega.  Army and civilian officials have said civilians will be treated as rebels if they do not flee rebel forces, while a rebel spokesman has warned civilians to clear out of the capital.  “Attacks against civilians are on the rise in Burundi, and that’s a very dangerous sign,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Both government army officers and rebel commanders must hold their troops accountable for these deliberate attacks on ordinary people who have no place to run.”  The briefing also documents cases of children abducted to serve in rebel forces.","Africa, Burundi",""

Russian authorities have announced that the Aki-Yurt tent camp in northern Ingushetia will be closed by December 1, 2002, and are now hastening the return of its 1,700 inhabitants. """"Closing tent camps and pressuring people to go back to Chechnya without offering any reasonable alternative amounts to forcible return,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “This is a clear violation of Russia’s obligations under international law.” Earlier this fall the Federal Migration Service along with local migration authorities started pressuring internally displaced persons living in the Aki-Yurt camp to leave, threatening them with imminent deadlines for the camp’s closure and making promises of alternative shelter. But the proposed shelters—including an abandoned bottling factory and a dairy farm in disuse—were uninhabitable. Since September, about nineteen families left the camp either for Chechnya or for the alternative shelters. Most inhabitants, however, refused to leave.  Now migration service officials have announced that by December 1, they would cut off gas, electricity, and water supplies in the camp and remove all tents. A Federal Migration Service representative in Moscow told Human Rights Watch that the decision to close the camp was based on warnings published by the Ingush fire department and sanitary inspection.  Residents of Aki-Yurt are now being offered no specific alternative accommodation in Ingushetia. The Federal Migration Service claims that no forced return is under way and that people simply do not want to remain in the camp. Reportedly, at least thirty families have left the camp for Chechnya over the past three days. It is unclear where residents will live once migration officials close the camp on Sunday. Since the temporary accommodation centers in Chechnya are already overcrowded, migration authorities expect the returnees to rent private space in Chechnya and promised to pay every returnee about 20 rubles (less than U.S. $1.00 ) per day to cover rent, food, and all other costs of living.  About 25,000 displaced persons from Chechnya remain in tent camps in Ingushetia. Human Rights Watch research in Ingushetia this summer indicated that most prefer to tolerate the deprivations of tent camps rather than return to Chechnya, where the armed conflict and human rights violations continue, particularly arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances, torture, and extrajuducial executions.  In May 2002, federal authorities published a plan to close all tent camps in Ingushetia and to return the displaced persons living in them to Chechnya; now migration authorities announced a plan to close all camps by December 31. While officially stating that returns would take place on a strictly voluntarily basis, throughout the summer and early fall migration authorities actively used a combination of threats and incentives to pressure displaced persons to return to Chechnya. In order to hasten returns, migration officials have consistently dismissed the real threats of human rights abuses that persist in Chechnya.  “Russian authorities are trying to get rid of the tent camps at any cost, since they are the most visible indication that the situation in Chechnya is far from normal,” said Andersen. “They make it hard indeed to convince Russians and the international community that the conflict is winding down. But the conflict is dragging on and serious human rights violations continue there unabated. Forcing people to return to them is unconscionable.”  Human Rights Watch calls on the Russian government to stop coercing internally displaced persons into returning to Chechnya and to ensure that they continue to enjoy protection and humanitarian assistance in accordance with international law. It also urges the relevant international agencies involved in the region to protest any measures that may endanger the lives and well-being of thousands of internally displaced people residing in Ingushetia.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Refugees and Migrants, Internally Displaced People"

Government forces have killed and arrested individuals on the basis solely of their ethnicity, religion or support for the opposition party. The 16-page report, “Côte d’Ivoire: Government Abuses in Response to Army Revolt,” documents security force raids after the attempted coup which began on September 19, 2002. The raids targeted entire neighborhoods in which northerners or non-Ivorians were arbitrarily arrested and their houses razed. Others were similarly targeted for their political affiliation or presumed status as an “assailant,” a word used by the government to describe anyone it views as supporting the army mutiny. The term “terrorist” was also widely used. Local human rights defenders are also living in fear, and many have gone into hiding. “Legitimate security measures are one thing, but targeting individuals just on the basis of their ethnic group or religion is completely unacceptable,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Even in a time of emergency, basic human rights must be respected.”  Human Rights Watch researchers visited Côte d’Ivoire in late October, following the attacks launched by dissident soldiers on September 19.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern at reported abuses by the dissident soldiers — calling themselves the Patriotic Movement of Côte d’Ivoire (Mouvement Patriotique de Côte d’Ivoire, MPCI) — who launched the attacks and remain in control of several towns. Although researchers could not visit rebel-held areas, due to security concerns, there are credible reports in those areas of unlawful killings and detentions.  Government policy has deliberately exacerbated tensions among Ivorians of different ethnic and religious backgrounds over the last few years, and also failed to address the violence and intimidation that marred presidential and parliamentary elections of late 2000.  “This downward spiral in respect for human rights is not inevitable,” said Takirambudde. “The way to stop that spiral is to bring to justice the people who are responsible for abuses. Without such action, Côte d’Ivoire could plunge into the sort of brutal war well known to neighboring Liberia and Sierra Leone.”  In mid-October, people dressed in military uniform killed several dozen civilians—Ivorian Muslims, Malians and Burkinabés—in Daloa, soon after the government gained control of the town. In the face of international criticism, the government has ordered an inquiry into this mass killing.  Human Rights Watch called on the government of Côte d’Ivoire to take steps immediately to halt abuses. In particular, the Ivorian government should:  Publicly acknowledge and condemn the unlawful killings of alleged ”assailants” and opposition sympathisers, provide comprehensive public information on their killings and compensation to the families, and facilitate access for the families to the criminal justice system; make public statements that no person should be arrested or attacked on the basis of ethnic, religious or national identity. Suspend from active duty, investigate, and prosecute where appropriate all members of the security forces accused of unlawful killings, arrests or extortion. Ensure that the criminal justice system effectively responds to allegations that human rights abuses have been committed, paying particular attention to bringing to justice those responsible for assaults motivated by suspicion of foreigners, Muslims, or northerners. Human Rights Watch also called on the rebel forces to ensure that all its combatants are instructed to respect the human rights of all civilians and to treat all captives in accordance with international humanitarian law.  A ceasefire officially came into force on October 18, 2002 and appears to be holding — though both sides have been strengthening their military positions. There are hopes that peace talks mediated by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) may lead to an end to hostilities and a resolution of the main issues underlying the crisis. Human Rights Watch urged ECOWAS to ensure that an end to impunity for human rights abuses be a key part of any peace agreement.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire","Religious Freedom"

Local corruption and the complicity of international officials in Bosnia have allowed a trafficking network to flourish, in which women are tricked, threatened, physically assaulted and sold as chattel, the report said. The 75-page report, “Hopes Betrayed: Trafficking of Women and Girls to Post-Conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina for Forced Prostitution,” documents how local Bosnian police officers facilitate the trafficking by creating false documents; visiting brothels to partake of free sexual services; and sometimes engaging in trafficking directly.  Human Rights Watch also obtained documents from the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (UNMIBH) that revealed cases of International Police Task Force (IPTF) officers visiting nightclubs as clients of trafficked women and girls, arranging to have trafficked women delivered to their residences, and in one case, tampering with witnesses to conceal an IPTF officer's complicity.  “Local and international police should be protecting these women, not participating in the abuses against them,” said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. “Trafficked women and girls face betrayal on all sides: by the agents who recruit them; by police duty-bound to protect them; and by individuals in the international community sworn to uphold the rule of law.”  Promised lucrative jobs in Western Europe, women and girls—mostly from Moldova, Romania and Ukraine—instead find themselves trapped in debt bondage and forced prostitution. Human Rights Watch's three-year investigation found extensive trafficking into the country, with estimates hovering at 2,000 victims. Many women and girls are sold for prices ranging from U.S.$694 to U.S.$2,315 (€769 to €2,564).  Local officials often fail to investigate and arrest traffickers, while blaming the victims for their reluctance to testify. Meanwhile, international police officers patronize the clubs where trafficked women perform, sending a strong message to trafficking victims that they cannot trust the authorities to help them escape their “owners.”  Human Rights Watch also found evidence that at least three IPTF monitors purchased women and their passports from traffickers and nightclub owners. These monitors did not face criminal investigation or prosecution in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but were merely repatriated. UNMIBH admitted in April 2002 that 18 IPTF officers have been repatriated for “sexual misconduct” over the life of the mission.  “Individual international police officers have purchased human beings and received slaps on the wrist,” said Jefferson. “Repatriation is not an adequate consequence for these acts.”  Human Rights Watch urged the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina to provide witness protection and services to trafficking victims, to arrest and prosecute traffickers, and to crack down on corruption.  Human Rights Watch also pressed the European Union to make anti-trafficking a priority when it takes over the policing mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina in January 2003.  Excerpts from testimonies:  Human Rights Watch investigators interviewed women during a brothel raid in March 1999. One woman in her mid-twenties, A.A., from Ukraine, told Human Rights Watch:  When I came to work here, they tricked me on the way. They told us that we would dance.

He said that we had to work off three more months even after we worked off our debt. He said that he would sell us to another man. He said that we had to work until the 8th of March. After that we still had to work….[The owner] from the first place sold us for 1,500 Deutschmarks [€769/U.S.$694].

[The traffickers] brought me to a bar and told me that I had to work as a prostitute. I worked for two months in Republika Srpska, near Doboj…. I refused to work and they beat me…. I worked and they never paid me. Every time I refused to work, they beat me. Then [the owner] sold us to [someone else] and brought us here.

On Thursday, November 21, Interior Minister Koba Narchemashvili demanded regressive new amendments to Georgia’s already seriously flawed criminal procedure code, and parliament indicated it would pass whatever he proposed.  The interior minister was summoned before parliament to account for rising crime after last Wednesday’s murder in central Tbilisi of Kakhi Asatiani—a businessman and former soccer star. In parliament, Narchemashvili first blamed legislators for having adopted a criminal procedure code that he said ties his ministry’s hands. He then demanded extension of the 12 hours the code currently allows the police to detain suspects incommunicado, and suggested that his ministry should take back some operational control of pre-trial detention facilities from the Ministry of Justice. In a television program that night, Narchemashvili proposed that witnesses be stripped of the right to legal representation. “What the interior minister is pushing for is a torturers’ charter,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Both the Council of Europe and the U.N. have demanded more safeguards for detainees in Georgia, but now the Interior Ministry proposes the exact opposite.” Georgian law enforcement officials commonly torture detainees and breach provisions of the criminal procedure code guaranteeing due process. In April, the U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concern about “widespread and continuing subjection of prisoners to torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment by law enforcement officials and prison officers” in Georgia. The Ministry of Justice forensic bureau confirmed to Human Rights Watch yesterday at least four cases of police use of electric shock torture this year, and instances of forged signatures on detainees’ statements to police. Regular screening of detainees transferred from police stations to Ministry of Justice-controlled pre-trial detention facilities has revealed dozens of beating victims and breaches of the 72-hour maximum set by law for police detention.  In 1998, under Council of Europe guidance, Georgia adopted a new criminal procedure code that strengthened due process protections for detainees. But in May and July 1999—just weeks after Georgia’s accession to the Council of Europe—the Georgian parliament adopted dozens of regressive amendments to the code, stripping away these protections, including the right to file a complaint with a court about abuse or torture during pre-trial detention. Human Rights Watch’s concern over these amendments prompted the publication in October 2000 of its report, Backtracking on Reform: Amendments Undermine Access to Justice.  “The 1999 amendments were a huge step backwards. The harmful effect they had on detainees’ rights needs to be reversed—not exacerbated,” said Andersen.  One present criminal procedure code provision hands the police 12 hours effectively to do whatever they wish with detainees, before giving them access to a lawyer or doctor. The 12-hour rule is at variance with Georgia’s constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights, to which Georgia is a party. Georgia’s Ombudswoman Nana Devdariani and two nongovernmental organizations have filed a challenge to its validity with the Constitutional Court. Nevertheless, the interior minister has now complained that 12 hours of incommunicado detention is an insufficient amount of time for police officers.  The 1999 amendments also stripped witnesses of the right to legal representation, but a June 2001 amendment restored this right. On Thursday, Narchemashvili argued that it was a superfluous right, and should be removed from the code. However, in the “Backtracking on Reform” report, Human Rights Watch documented the common police tactic of purposefully classifying detained suspects as witnesses in order to deprive them of access to counsel and other rights.  In his appearance before parliament, Narchemashvili argued that criminal investigations suffered because police were no longer able to conduct “operative measures” in pre-trial detention facilities. In early 2000, the Georgian government transferred control over these facilities from the Interior Ministry to the Ministry of Justice, in compliance with its Council of Europe obligations. Since then, the facilities have become more transparent to scrutiny.  “The police regularly abuse the powers they have now,” said Andersen. “Giving them even more won’t solve the crime problem. That can only happen if the police earn the public’s trust.” But even the Georgian government acknowledges a vast deficit in public trust of police. In 2001, the government established a commission to devise a new criminal procedure code and a plan to reform Georgia’s security and law enforcement agencies. In September 2002, the commission issued a report acknowledging that: “The scale of corruption within the law enforcement system seriously hinders the process of establishing a law-based country, and reduces confidence in justice and the rule of law.” The report also underlined the need for the government to demonstrate political will if reforms are to succeed.  Several cases documented this year have highlighted police corruption. In June, 60 Minutes, a television investigative program, exposed the head of the Interior Ministry’s anti-narcotics department instructing an informant to plant drugs on someone the department could then extort money from to drop charges. On September 27, more than 20 police officers raided a local television station in Zugdidi, beating staff and smashing equipment. The station had cooperated with 60 Minutes on a report about police involvement in gasoline smuggling from Abkhazia. On the same day, police allegedly mistreated the mother and 10-year-old son of the program’s Zugdidi correspondent.  “The Georgian government should be pressing forward with criminal justice reform,” said Andersen. Human Rights Watch urged the Georgian government to immediately introduce amendments to rectify the worst faults of the present criminal procedure code, including to abolish the 12-hour rule, and to restore to detainees the right to petition a court at any time with complaints of abuses committed against them during the pre-trial investigation. Human Rights Watch also recommended the introduction of mechanisms to ensure swift investigations and remedies on behalf of prisoners found at initial screenings to have been subjected to injuries or violations of the 72-hour detention deadline at police stations.","Europe/Central Asia, Georgia",""

In a new report, “Liberian Refugees in Guinea: Refoulement, Militarization of Camps, and Other Protection Concerns”, Human Rights Watch said the Guinean government’s close relationship with Liberian rebel groups is posing a serious threat to refugees’ security and protection in Guinea. Hundreds of Liberians seeking asylum in Guinea are being forced back to Liberia to join the ranks of the rebel group Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), either as fighters or to work for them as porters. LURD soldiers have prevented others from even reaching the border.  International human rights law prohibits the return, or refoulement, of people to situations where their life or freedom would be threatened.  “The Guinean government is clearly violating international human rights law in its treatment of these refugees,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “On top of that, Guinean authorities are facilitating human rights abuses by the Liberian rebels.”  Many refugees told Human Rights Watch how LURD members operate freely and openly within Guinea. They described how the Guinean military near the border stop refugees, select some for return, and order them back to Liberia. Often, the Guinean soldiers physically handed refugees over to LURD commanders.  Human Rights Watch’s report was released to coincide with a U.N. Security Council discussion on Monday, November 25 of sanctions imposed on the Liberian government because of its support for rebels in Sierra Leone.  Human Rights Watch researchers were particularly alarmed by the situation in Kouankan, the largest refugee camp in Guinea: LURD combatants, often uniformed and sometimes armed, were able to move freely in and out of the camp, and in some cases were reported to be residing there. Guinean military officials who controlled the only entry point to the camp were clearly aware of the movements of LURD members, but were doing nothing to prevent them.  “Refugees have been threatened and intimidated,” said Takirambudde. “The LURD have engaged in forced military recruitment of men and young boys among the refugees, and have abducted adolescent girls for sex, then returned them to the camp. This is not acceptable: the civilian nature of all refugee camps must be preserved, and camp residents must be safe.”  Within the last two weeks, Human Rights Watch has received credible reports of some Liberian refugees leaving Kouankan camp and seeking safety in refugee camps in Sierra Leone.  In the areas of Koyama and Fassankoni, refugees were not being forced back to Liberia, but were facing a range of other abuses, including arbitrary arrest and detention in military or police custody, on unsubstantiated charges of fighting for the Liberian government. Several male refugees who were detained were ill-treated by the Guinean military or police. They were not seriously questioned about any criminal offense and in most cases, were able to secure their release after bribing Guinean officials.  Human Rights Watch also called on the Guinean government to allow unrestricted access to the border areas to staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and humanitarian agencies. Government authorities have often blocked access on the grounds that the areas are too dangerous.  Human Rights Watch also urged UNHCR to take a more active and public role in calling on the Guinean government to ensure refugee protection and security, and to immediately report to the authorities any instance of abuse.","Africa, Guinea, Liberia","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations"

An investigation by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) revealed 18 cases of sexual abuse and exploitation in Bhutanese refugee camps in Nepal. Victims included a 7-year old girl and a person with disabilities.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch welcomed the decision by UNHCR to finally take action to address the situation in Nepal, including the dispatch of a special team to investigate the situation. Both organizations urge that thorough and effective action is taken in response to this appalling situation, including bringing the perpetrators to justice, organizing prompt psycho-social rehabilitation and redress for the victims, and implementing codes of conduct in the camp in order to prevent the reoccurrence of such abuse.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch stressed that these cases of abuse underscored the plight of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal, many of whom have by now spent ten years in enforced exile while negotiations between the governments of Nepal and Bhutan on their possible return have stalled. Many of the refugees were children at the time they left Bhutan and now face becoming stateless.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch appealed to UNHCR and key donor governments to both countries - including Denmark, the current President of the European Union - to intensify their efforts to encourage the Bhutan and Nepal governments to find an early and constructive solution to the plight of the refugees.  """"These people have been kept in limbo for ten years. This is already too long,"""" Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said.  Background  Despite 11 rounds of bilateral talks between the governments of Nepal and Bhutan, a solution to the plight of these people seems a long way off. Major obstacles remain to be solved before those who have the right to return to Bhutan under international law can do so. Among the main obstacles are four categories in which both governments in 1993 agreed to classify the people in the refugee camps as the basis for determining who can return to Bhutan.  Since 1993, both governments have disputed the interpretation of these categories, the process by which the people in the refugee camps would be put into these categories and what would happen to them once they are categorized. There has also been no agreement on the practicalities of repatriation, and the Bhutan government appears to have so far given little attention to the need to ensure the sustainability of the return of the refugees.  Information of the abuses of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal follows of allegations earlier this year of widespread gender based violence and abuse by humanitarian workers and peacekeepers in refugee camps in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea. The West Africa cases were brought to light by a UNHCR/Save the Children UK study. Subsequent investigations by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services failed to substantiate some of the allegations, but nevertheless revealed a worrying picture where vulnerable refugees, especially women and girls, are preyed upon by persons in positions of power. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch warned that the Nepal situation further highlighted the dangers of sexual abuse and exploitation in refugee camp communities and the need to avoid complacency on this issue.","Asia, Bhutan, Nepal","Women's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Speaking at Friday Prayers in Tehran this morning, the leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran ordered the students to """"return to their homes"""" or """"the people will intervene"""" against them.  Human Rights Watch said the leader's statements were a thinly veiled threat to unleash the same paramilitary forces that the authorities used in July 1999 to crush student protests. Despite worldwide condemnation of those events, they have never been properly investigated and those responsible have never been brought to justice. Several hundred students were injured in July 1999 when irregular, unidentified forces stormed student dormitories and assaulted students in the streets in Tehran and other cities.

Danish police have charged Nizar al-Khazraji, former chief of staff of Iraq's armed forces, for his suspected involvement in war crimes perpetrated in Iraq against Kurdish civilians during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Al-Khazraji appeared in court in the town of Soroe on November 19, and was charged with violating articles 146 and 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilians in Time of War. """"Joining the Iraqi opposition cannot be a 'get out of jail free card' for mass murder,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. """"These charges send the signal that there is no impunity for former Iraqi officials who may be responsible for horrific crimes. To its credit, Denmark has used its criminal law to prosecute al-Khazraji in a way that furthers justice internationally.""""  Megally said he expected the al-Khazraji case would be the first of many such cases.  The charges relate to crimes perpetrated in 1984-1988, when, for a time, al-Khazraji held the post of head of the Iraqi army's First Corps. During the court hearing Tuesday, he was accused of responsibility for crimes perpetrated against the Kurdish population through measures not justifiable by military necessity in the context of the Iran-Iraq war. These crimes included the execution of wounded civilians, summary execution of civilians found in areas declared as """"prohibited for reasons of security"""" by the Iraqi authorities, the mass forcible relocation of civilians from their homes, and pillage. Al-Khazraji denied the charges and lodged an immediate appeal against the court's decision.  His appeal is due to be heard before a superior court within the next few days. He was not taken into custody, but, for the present, is unable to leave the country.  Denmark is applying universal jurisdiction, which allows national courts to investigate and prosecute the most egregious crimes under international law, regardless of where the crimes occurred.  In addition to documenting other crimes committed by the Iraqi authorities, Human Rights Watch has extensively documented the attempted genocide of Iraqi Kurds. In its publication Iraq's Crime of Genocide: The Anfal Campaign against the Kurds, Human Rights Watch detailed how, from February to September 1988, Iraqi troops swept through the highlands of Iraqi Kurdistan rounding up everyone who remained in government-declared """"prohibited zones."""" More than 100,000 Kurds, mostly men and boys, were trucked to remote sites and executed.  The assault on the Kurds was also marked by the use of chemical weapons, which reached its peak in March 1988, where in the town of Halabja alone, some 5,000 persons died from chemical gas attacks.  At the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Nizar al-Khazraji was appointed chief of staff of Iraq's armed forces, a post he held until shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. He fled Iraq in 1996 and, following periods of residence in Jordan and Spain, sought political asylum in Denmark in 1998, which was denied.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Denmark, Iraq","International Justice"

The bill also fails to provide adequate protection for unaccompanied immigrant children. """"In trying to protect America, Congress gave short shrift to protecting civil rights,"""" said Wendy Patten, U.S. advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"Much better safeguards are needed to ensure that this new and very powerful agency respects rights while carrying out its mission."""" The legislation does not contain effective internal oversight and accountability mechanisms for abuses by officers of the new agency. Although the bill establishes an officer for civil rights and civil liberties in the new department, the officer is not empowered to conduct investigations of rights violations by agency officials, who will include staff from a variety of previously separate agencies, such as the Border Patrol, Coast Guard, Customs Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The new department will include virtually all of the functions of these agencies, not just their components that focus on fighting terrorism. Human Rights Watch has investigated abuses by INS personnel and found that these abuses persist because agents are not held accountable for violations of law and policy and because of structural flaws in the investigative and disciplinary process. Based on those findings, Human Rights Watch had urged lawmakers to ensure the homeland security bill would include strong mechanisms to prevent, investigate and punish such abuses. In particular, Human Rights Watch called for a designated official in the Inspector General's Office with sufficient expertise and stature to carry out investigations of civil rights complaints and ensure effective civil rights enforcement. """"The new Department urgently needs a Deputy Inspector General for Civil Rights,"""" said Patten. """"Without this position, there's no guarantee that civil rights complaints will be handled effectively."""" The bill also fails to include basic protections for unaccompanied immigrant children, such as access to counsel and a legal guardian for every child in immigration custody. By moving the care and placement of unaccompanied minors from the INS to the Department of Health and Human Services, the bill does accomplish an important step in protecting immigrant children. But by failing to include provisions mandating access to counsel and standards of detention in children's cases, the legislation ignores the special needs of unaccompanied minors - needs reflected in the version of the bill previously passed by a Senate committee. Without these provisions, the legislation does not adequately protect the rights of unaccompanied children who arrive on U.S. shores. In September, Human Rights Watch sent letters to each of the 100 U.S. senators, urging them to remedy the bill's failings by insisting that these protections be part of any legislation creating a new homeland security department. Human Rights Watch has worked closely with an informal coalition of U.S. civil rights and immigrants rights groups to urge the Congress to provide for vigorous enforcement of rights protections as it moved to create a homeland security agency. The new Department of Homeland Security will include roughly 170,000 employees from 22 federal agencies, including 74,300 armed federal agents. The legislation represents the most significant reorganization of the U.S. government in over 50 years.","United States, Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy, Racial Justice","Children's Rights"

The decision marks the first time in Colombia that the United States has suspended assistance on human rights grounds. “By suspending funding, the United States can be certain of getting the military’s attention,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “When there is impunity in Colombia, as in the Santo Domingo case, it is imperative that the Department of State follow its legal obligation to send precisely this kind of clear message. This decision strengthens the credibility of the policy and the rule of law.” On December 13, 1998, a Colombian Air Force helicopter launched rockets during a prolonged clash with units of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) near the village of Santo Domingo, Arauca. According to residents, several rockets hit civilian homes. Eighteen civilians died, among them seven children.  Instead of carrying out an impartial investigation, the military engaged in a cover up, blaming the incident on a FARC-EP car bomb. However, government investigators later determined that the shrapnel responsible for the civilian deaths came from a U.S.-made rocket launched from a helicopter assigned to the First Air Combat Command, based at Palanquero. The helicopter pilots told investigators that they received targeting coordinates from AirScan, a U.S. contractor working for the air force.  “It is particularly important for the United States to demand credible investigations when its weaponry and U.S. citizens are implicated in abuses,” Vivanco said.  Currently, U.S. authorities say they will continue to cooperate with the Colombian investigation. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard has reportedly opened an investigation of one American allegedly involved, who may have been a Coast Guard employee at the time of the Santo Domingo incident.  The decision is based on U.S. legislation that requires the Secretary of State to suspend military aid to foreign security force units credibly alleged to be involved in human rights violations when there are no effective measures taken to investigate and punish those responsible.  In 2002, the U.S. government provided Colombia with $415 million in military aid and, in a new development, lifted restrictions preventing the Colombian security forces from using the funding to combat illegal armed groups. As of September 13, 2002, there were 138 temporary and permanent U.S. military personnel and 250 U.S. civilians retained as individual contractors in Colombia, according to U.S. government reports.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

The twenty-page report, entitled """"Conscription through Detention in the Russian Armed Forces,"""" examines the discriminatory treatment of young men who have not been successfully served with draft summonses and are forcibly brought to recruitment offices by police officials. They are given no effective opportunity to challenge their conscription, although Russian law gives draftees that right. """"Draft boards view these men as though they had been convicted of draft evasion, but in fact they're not charged with any crime,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Russian government has a right to enforce the legal obligation for young men to perform military service, but should still uphold the principle of non-discrimination and due process standards.""""  Military officials send these conscripts to their assigned military units the very day they are detained, preventing contact with their families or advocacy groups who would help them appeal a conscription order. The report found that this practice effectively denies young men the right, under Russian law, to appeal their conscription.  Using accelerated conscription procedures, draft boards deny those detained for conscription a thorough medical examination and the benefit of medical or other exemptions and deferrals that are clearly provided for in Russian law.  In several of the cases researched by Human Rights Watch, the arbitrary proceedings resulted in young men with valid deferral or exemption grounds being drafted into the armed forces. For example, in May 2002 police detained """"Stepan O."""" (a pseudonym) and brought him to the local recruitment office. There, the draft board quickly issued a conscription order, despite the fact that Stepan O. told them he was studying at a Moscow university. He was sent to a military base that same evening. After intervention by the Union of Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia, the Moscow city procuracy recognized Stepan O. had been unlawfully drafted and he was finally released from service.  The Russian armed forces' reputation for serious human rights abuses motivates many young men to try actively to avoid the draft. Often, they do so by avoiding being served draft summonses, which under law must be physically handed to them for signature. As a result, each year military authorities in Moscow and St. Petersburg have difficulties meeting their draft quotas.  Human Rights Watch called on the Russian authorities to adopt legislation to ensure every potential conscript has the opportunity to appeal the conscription order in court. It recommended that such legislation introduce a minimum time period between receiving a conscription order and the day of departure to a military base. Human Rights Watch also urged the Russian government to address the widespread abuses in the armed forces that make so many young men anxious to avoid military service.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Facing a funding deficit, the world body has suspended humanitarian assistance to 3 million North Koreans in the western part of the country. More aid cuts may come.   Emergency shipments of Chinese grain could ease the crisis. But to stabilize the situation on its border, China must also address the rights of thousands of North Koreans who have fled into China.   In a new report to be released on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch has documented the refugee crisis and its human toll. A former detainee in a North Korean logging camp described how prisoners survived, catching rats using shoes as traps, then roasting and eating them secretly.   The embarrassing rush of North Koreans into diplomatic compounds in China beginning last March provoked the Chinese authorities to tighten border security, to search for North Koreans in hiding and to go after those suspected of helping them.   Hiding in villages among Chinese citizens of Korean descent, North Korean asylum seekers are victimized twice. Once they make it into China, they are highly vulnerable to abuse, extortion and exploitation. Desperate women sell sexual services through prostitution or arranged marriage. Or they are sold or abducted into sexual slavery. Some are beaten by violent Chinese husbands after seeking shelter with church groups who tell them marriage is the only way to avoid detection.   At any moment, North Koreans risk being picked up by Chinese authorities and returned to North Korea under the terms of a secret 1986 agreement between Beijing and Pyongyang. Yet under the UN Refugee Convention, to which it is a party, China is obligated not to push back asylum seekers in danger of persecution. In North Korea, anyone leaving the country without authorization is subject to three years in a labor camp, or even the death penalty.   A comprehensive strategy is needed to address the human rights disaster in North Korea and the impact on neighboring countries. North Koreans are entitled to leave their homeland under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Pyongyang must immediately cease punishing those who flee and also stop persecuting their family members.   China should halt the forcible return of North Koreans, and begin a high-level dialogue with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees to establish a screening mechanism for asylum seekers.   Countries that hold bilateral talks with China including the United States, Japan, the United Kingdomand Australia should raise this issue with Beijing. As an interim step, Beijing should be urged to grant all North Koreans an indefinite humanitarian status and allow aid groups to operate in border areas without intimidation or arrest.   Addressing the refugee crisis must be part of a broader strategy to bring North Korea out of its isolation. Giving humanitarian aid is one answer. Exposing North Korea's human rights violations, now largely hidden, should also be a priority.  Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington D.C.

Suzhou, a city of one million in Jiangsu province, passed a law in October guaranteeing patients and their families equal access to employment, education and health care, and giving PLWHA the right to sue for redress. The law is the first of its kind in China. Human Rights Watch urged China's new Communist party leadership to press government authorities to adopt similar legislation that protects the rights of PLWHA, and to ensure they are enforced. """"Suzhou has taken the lead, but the rest of China is dragging its feet,"""" said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS and Human Rights program at Human Rights Watch. """"The national government urgently needs to follow Suzhou's example.""""  Many Chinese laws attempt to control and supervise people living with HIV/AIDS, and to punish people in high-risk groups, said Csete, but the Suzhou city ordinance is the first one in China that protects their rights.  The Chinese Ministry of Health has acknowledged that it faces a rapidly-escalating AIDS epidemic and has asked for international assistance in combating it. However, local and national laws still permit many forms of discrimination against PLWHA. National laws prohibit HIV-positive persons from marrying, and local laws in some cities forbid them from swimming in public swimming pools or working in food service or childcare. There have been widespread reports in Chinese and international media of community harassment and of discrimination by employers, hospitals and schools. China's sixteenth Communist Party Congress convened on Friday, November 8, to nominate a new Central Committee, Politburo and seven-member Standing Committee that will run the country for the next five years. Human Rights Watch called on the incoming national leaders to prioritize sweeping legal reform on AIDS. A new national law should be passed that includes protection of the rights of infected persons and guarantees of patient confidentiality. National, provincial and city governments should reform existing laws that permit discrimination and should include provisions to protect patient confidentiality.  These laws increase the public stigma surrounding HIV/AIDS, and discourage people from voluntarily testing for the virus.

The problem is widespread and encompasses countries that joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1999, are top candidates for NATO membership this year, or are seeking improved relations with NATO. We feel that the upcoming NATO summit in Prague, Czech Republic, provides an opportunity for NATO to address the urgent need to improve arms trade controls in Central and Eastern Europe. Weak arms trade controls in Central and Eastern Europe are responsible for a number of serious problems. Key concerns include:  Illicit arms trafficking: too often, arms traffickers are able to bypass lax laws to supply weapons to illegal destinations.  The glut of surplus weapons: governments continue to sell surplus weapons from their arsenals to trouble spots around the globe.  Irresponsible authorized arms exports: governments continue to export arms to destinations where the weapons risk fueling human rights abuses and armed conflict.   A fourth key concern, lack of transparency, cuts across these issue areas.   In our view NATO has an important responsibility to assess the progress of partner countries and new allies in controlling arms transfers, to identify areas needing further improvement, and to promote needed changes. To contribute to such measures, we have prepared a brief overview of our recent research findings on arms export issues, covering developments over the past year in several Central and Eastern European countries that have or are seeking membership in NATO. The document also highlights our recommendations for action. The briefing paper, which we will forward to you under separate cover, is available at https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/arms/nato1115-bck.htm.   As noted in that document, in recent months there have been some positive developments and an overall increased level of attention in Central and Eastern Europe to the need to tighten arms trade controls. NATO and its member states, through dialogue and assistance to candidate countries and other partners, have contributed to this momentum toward reform. We are troubled, however, that irresponsible and illegal arms trading continues, as documented with scores of examples in the briefing paper. We feel strongly that these merit further attention, including after enlargement decisions are finalized and new members begin to be integrated into NATO.   We hope that your government will take the opportunity to engage with NATO allies, candidate countries, and other partners about these pressing issues and work to secure needed improvements. In particular, we hope NATO and its member states will:  Make clear that responsible arms trading practices, including strict arms trade controls and the disposal of surplus weapons in conformity with human rights criteria, are a requirement for membership and the minimum standard expected of future NATO members.  Promote the harmonization of arms trade controls within NATO to the highest possible standard and actively encourage candidate countries and future members to undertake needed reforms to meet those standards.  Take steps to facilitate the progress of candidate countries and future members, including in the form of practical assistance directed to improving legal controls and law enforcement capacity and efforts to enhance information sharing.  Provide incentives, including financial assistance, for the responsible disposal (for example, through destruction) of surplus military equipment held by candidate countries and future members.  Make the transfer of newer military equipment from NATO member states to candidate countries and future members contingent on the recipient country's responsible disposal of quantities of surplus weapons.  Ensure that efforts to address the glut of surplus weapons in Central and Eastern Europe target heavy conventional weapons systems as well as small arms and light weapons.   We appreciate your attention to our concerns and look forward to continued dialogue with you.

The U.S.-based Gates Foundation this week announced a $100 million grant to combat the HIV/AIDS epidemic in India. “Bill Gates is right that the AIDS epidemic is poised to explode in India,” said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS program at Human Rights Watch. “But his generosity will be undermined if the Indian government doesn´t do something about the widespread violence against people who are affected by the disease.” Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases of police harassment and violence against HIV/AIDS outreach workers in India. The HIV/AIDS prevention workers help those at highest risk of getting AIDS, especially women in prostitution and men who have sex with men. Violence and harassment of these outreach workers is one of the best ways to ensure that the epidemic will spread quickly, Human Rights Watch said. Persecuting people affected by HIV/AIDS drives them further underground and makes it harder to treat and prevent the disease. In New York tonight, November 13, Human Rights Watch honors Meena Seshu for her work combating HIV/AIDS and human rights abuse in India. """"HIV/AIDS in India is an important human rights issue,"""" said Csete. """"The Indian government and international donors need to recognize that fact if they are really going to beat this epidemic."""" The Indian government clings to the idea that the epidemic is limited to “high-risk groups” – such as sex workers, drug users and truck drivers – and that targeting them with information about HIV transmission and condoms is the best strategy to contain the epidemic further. But this analysis no longer reflects the reality of AIDS, at least for some Indian states, where the epidemic is in the general population, Human Rights Watch said. In these states, said Csete, “Women who have sex only with their husbands may be the group at highest risk of HIV transmission.” The long-standing subordination of women and girls in Indian society takes on lethal dimensions with the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. Men, unlike women, can experiment with sex outside of marriage without any social stigma but women do not even have the status to demand condom use of husbands who may bring sexually transmitted diseases home, Human Rights Watch said. People with HIV/AIDS continue to face abuse and discrimination in the health care system, and many have no hope of treatment for opportunistic infections, let alone antiretroviral medicines. “It´s a sad irony that India is one of the biggest producers of the drugs that have transformed the lives of people with AIDS in wealthy countries,” said Csete. “But for millions of Indians, access to these medicines is a distant dream.”","Asia, India","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Sunday's elections capped a year of remarkable human rights progress in Turkey, with more advances than any year since the 1980 military coup. These included repeal of the death penalty, removal of some significant restraints on Kurdish and other minority language education and broadcasting, and a new draft law to guard against torture. But more reforms are needed for Turkey to meet the European Union's """"political criteria"""" for membership: the protection of human rights, rule of law and respect for minorities. The Justice and Development Party, known by its Turkish initials as the AKP, won the polls by a surprisingly large margin. It ran on a platform that included basic rights protections. Its leader, Tayyip Erdogan, has himself been banned from joining Parliament because of a past conviction for the expression of non-violent opinion. The election of a party whose president was stripped of his political rights is generally interpreted as the electorate's slap in the face for the state forces that manipulated the justice system to obtain his conviction and exclusion from the race. Some Turkish commentators warn that the AKP's support stems from strongly nationalist and religious elements with a poor record on the protection of human rights. They suggest that this new conservative government's interest in human rights will evaporate once it has amended the law under which Erdogan was convicted and stripped of his political rights, and lifted the headscarf ban which prevents many devout Muslim women from attending university. Both are indeed serious violations. But Turkey also faces a number of other human rights challenges, including restrictions on the press and free expression, unacceptable prison conditions and violations of the rights of the hundreds of thousands driven from their homes by security forces in their 15-year conflict with Kurdish separatists. There is recognition at the highest levels that legal reforms are needed. Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a judge and former president of the constitutional court, was elected president of the Turkish Republic in May 2000 after making a series of bold speeches calling for the legal system to be """"cleansed"""" of repressive features and """"regulations of a police state."""" Torture is still widespread. In August, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Turkish justice minister detailing 31 reports of torture involving 55 individuals since February 2002. In early October, the justice minister presented a draft torture-curbing law ensuring that all detainees get access to a lawyer from the first moment of detention. In its Accession Partnership document, the EU called on Turkey """"to undertake all necessary measures to reinforce the fight against torture."""" The EU specifically mentioned """"aligning legal procedures concerning pre-trial detention with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights and with the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture."""" Turkey has committed to do so, but until now has not fulfilled this undertaking. If Turkey's new leaders want to send a clear message of separation from past human rights abuses, there could be no better first step than quickly to pass the anti-torture law already in draft form. It would signal to Turkish society, the EU and the international community the government's firm commitment to the human rights of all Turkish citizens. How quickly can the torture reform be passed? The raft of major rights legislation was passed in record time this summer, in less than a week. Moving swiftly to pass torture reform could even put Turkey's level of legal protection against torture ahead of several other European member states, giving the country some badly needed high ground as it pushes its candidacy for Europe. The EU will make the key decision on setting a date for Turkey to join at its summit in Copenhagen next month. So time is short. A law offers no protection unless it is implemented. One month may not be sufficient time to show a convincing statistical drop in torture allegations. The new government should ensure that during those four weeks lawyers can visit their clients in police custody in all cases and in even the most far-flung regions of the country. Thorough implementation in the first days and weeks would help to establish a firm expectation of such access in the minds of police and defense lawyers alike. Turkey's sophisticated and educated society has chafed long enough at the threat of torture, along with paternalistic restrictions on freedom of expression, association, and religion. Swiftly adopting an agenda of rights reform will not only win Turkey kudos from the EU and abroad, but also at home.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/11/09/foreign-enemies-and-constitutional-rights","Foreign Enemies and Constitutional Rights","Foreign Enemies and Constitutional Rights","","11/09/2002","NEW YORK -- The Bush administration thinks it has a solution to the evidentiary and legal frustrations of prosecuting terrorist suspects: Designate them """"enemy combatants"""" and detain them indefinitely without charge or trial. But that raises the question: Is this an appropriate response to a serious security threat or a ploy to circumvent the U.S. Constitution? A federal court in New York will soon rule on the matter, and Congress is considering hearings. In doing so, they should look beyond the issue of detention to ask the surprisingly related question: Would it have been appropriate to shoot the suspects summarily? If a person is a criminal suspect, the Constitution requires the police to avoid using lethal force unless necessary to stop an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. But in the case of enemy combatants, the law of war permits them to be killed summarily, so long as they are not in custody or incapacitated. There is no duty to try to arrest or subdue enemy combatants. Which law should apply? If we are reluctant to start summarily shooting terrorist suspects on American soil--I suspect most Americans would be--we also should be reluctant to designate them as enemy combatants in order to deny them their due process rights. Take, for example, the case of Jose Padilla, presently before the court. The Bush administration claims that Padilla, an American citizen, is an enemy combatant because he allegedly came to the U.S. from Pakistan to detonate a radiological bomb. Padilla was seized in May upon his arrival at O'Hare International Airport and has been detainedwithout any due process rights ever since. Leaks from the U.S. Justice Department suggest that Padilla was nowhere near carrying out his alleged plans, and thus posed no imminent threat of the sort that might require the preventive use of lethal force. So if Padilla was merely a criminal suspect, he could only have been arrested. But if he came to wage war as an enemy combatant, as the Bush administration claims, he could have been shot in cold blood in the public concourses of O'Hare, regardless of any immediate danger he posed. I believe many Americans would have had qualms about Padilla being summarily shot. In part that is because they don't believe that the U.S. government should rely on military force when the criminal justice system is available. In part it is because they don't believe that criminal acts of the type Padilla is alleged to have been plotting really constitute war. For the time being, an armed conflict is still under way in eastern Afghanistan. Enemy soldiers there certainly qualify as combatants. But the Bush administration has spoken about a global war on terrorism. Does that mean that terrorist suspects anywhere in the world can be treated as combatants and shot? Or should the campaign outside of Afghanistan be treated as a matter for law enforcement, at least where there is a functioning criminal justice system to handle those cases? Consider an analogous situation in which armed conflict is raging in a distant country, U.S. troops are deeply involved, and enemy forces are sending clandestine agents to the U.S. to engage in secret operations that will kill thousands each year. The war on terrorism? No, the war on drugs. The drug war certainly involves real armed conflict in places such as Colombia, but when it gets to U.S. shores it is only rhetorically war--a hortatory call for law enforcement, not a mandate for the military to step in. The proof is how we go about fighting the war on drugs domestically. We arrest and prosecute drug dealers. As much as many Americans may abhor drug trafficking, we don't summarily shoot drug dealers in the street. But such killings would be appropriate if the war on drugs were a real war and the drug dealers were enemy combatants. Outside of Afghanistan, the war on terrorism is similarly rhetorical, even if American lives are at risk. At least where law enforcement is possible, these crimes and threatened crimes, serious as they are, must be pursued through the criminal justice system with its attendant due process rights. If we are uncomfortable summarily shooting terrorist suspects on the streets of New York (or Hamburg or London), then we should also be uncomfortable declaring them enemy combatants to circumvent their due process rights and detain them summarily. This insight won't solve all the legal problems now working their way through the courts. Someone such as Louisiana-born Yasser Esam Hamdi may well be an enemy combatant because he was captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan, but he should still be entitled to judicial review of his detention because he is an American citizen detained in the U.S. But Jose Padilla and suspects like him captured far from the battlefield should not be treated as enemy combatants. If they are plotting serious crimes, they should be charged and tried with full due process rights.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

The Indian government says there are 4 million persons with HIV/AIDS in India, a figure that most experts think is grossly understated. Since the national AIDS program refuses to provide anti-retroviral treatment, prevention is the only hope for the millions at risk of infection. “Meena Seshu has worked tirelessly to prevent and contain one of the worst epidemics in the world,” said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. “I have seen the impact of Meena's brave work firsthand. If there were more activists with her courage and sense of solidarity with the most marginalized, the AIDS crisis in India wouldn't stand a chance.”  AIDS in India, which has already killed millions, is fueled in part by official harassment and social stigmatization of women in prostitution, men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, prisoners and others at high risk of infection. These groups suffered severe discrimination and abuse even before the advent of the AIDS epidemic, and are further marginalized by it with lethal results. In recent years, both these persons and outreach workers who have tried to bring HIV/AIDS information and condoms to them have often met with violent abuse and harassment by the police, including unlawful arrest, sexual and physical abuse, and extortion.  Meena Seshu is founder and general secretary of SANGRAM, an organization based in Sangli, Maharashtra State, that has helped women in prostitution become AIDS educators among themselves and in the wider community. SANGRAM has empowered women in prostitution to demand safe sex of their clients and has built on that transforming work to organize HIV/AIDS education and condom distribution for the general population. In the districts in which it works, SANGRAM’s programs ensure the distribution of up to 350,000 condoms per month. SANGRAM also supports peer education on HIV/AIDS for men who have sex with men.  In early 2002, women sex workers in a collective supported by SANGRAM in Nippani (Karnataka State) were systematically and violently harassed by local thugs supported by Shiv Sena, a Hindu political party. The collective’s life-saving work in the town was disrupted as members were forced to flee their homes. When the women attempted to file a complaint with the police, they were told they were not “normal citizens” with the right to file complaints. Meena Seshu was attacked by local leaders in the press and accused of using HIV/AIDS education as a front for running brothels. Undaunted, Seshu mobilized support from around the country and forced an investigation of the acts of violence against the women in prostitution, managing to reestablish much of the work of the collective. SANGRAM continues its work as a living example of fighting AIDS by defending the rights of those whose risk of infection is heightened by marginalization and discrimination.  “If the Indian government continues on this course of abuse of HIV/AIDS workers, it is literally a recipe for more death in India,” said Csete. “We hope that recognizing Meena Seshu will signal to India that the government must embrace and support such work to prevent the AIDS crisis from escalating further.”  Background on Meena Seshu: Meena Seshu is one of India’s most compelling and creative human rights and AIDS activists. She speaks consistently about the HIV/AIDS crisis as a human rights issue. Ms. Seshu is the general secretary of SANGRAM, an organization that works to stem the epidemic in Maharashtra state, which has one of the highest infection rates in India. SANGRAM disseminates basic information about HIV and distributes 350,000 condoms per month, which translates into significant HIV prevention. One of the group’s most successful projects is to build the capacity of sex workers to organize in collectives, negotiate condom use with their clients, and assert and defend their rights. Human Rights Watch worked with SANGRAM earlier this year and documented how the Indian police and local thugs obstructed SANGRAM’s work through harassment and abuse of its outreach workers. In so doing, the police prevented the dissemination of essential information and services and perpetuated the social stigmatization of vulnerable populations. Ms. Seshu, who has endured personal attacks by local authorities, has not let that stop her from working on behalf of some of India’s most marginalized people.","Asia, India","Health, Women's Rights, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

But this week the United Nations is debating another inspections regime of considerable significance, one designed to stamp out torture and other ill-treatment in prisons around the world. The United States has fought the UN initiative tooth and nail, lining up with some of the most abusive governments in the world, including those of China, Iran, Cuba and Sudan, against a coalition of its closest allies and partners. Since 1984, the UN Convention Against Torture has stood as an international prohibition of torture and other forms of cruel treatment. It has relied on the good faith of states to carry out its provisions, supervised by an overstretched group of experts who periodically review governments' performance. Now the UN is poised to adopt an international inspection mechanism that could visit prisons and make recommendations. After 10 years of negotiations, an optional protocol establishing this system will be voted on by the General Assembly. By most estimates, torture remains widespread in at least 70 countries, and ill-treatment of prisoners can occur in even the best- run systems. Many of the countries championing the new system are newly emerged democracies that have long, hard experience of the problem of torture. The protocol has support from a wide array of states including South Africa, Mexico, Bahrain and Indonesia. For governments trying to overhaul prison systems, often against resistance from recalcitrant military and security forces, the inspection regime promises a useful form of pressure and a source of international assistance. The United States has sought to derail this initiative at every stage in the process. Problems related to incompatibility with America's federal system have been largely resolved in negotiations on the text. Now the Bush administration is objecting to the possible cost of the proposed inspection regime. But best estimates, drawn from experience with a similar system in Europe, indicate that the mechanism could be fully operational for under $2 million per year. Governments put five times this amount into UN programs for the rehabilitation of torture victims, not to mention the money raised by private charities worldwide. U.S. officials have argued that the inspection system should be paid for by those who decide to join it. But a funding formula of this kind would discourage poorer states most in need of help from joining the inspection system. The torture inspection system is optional. The United States can choose to join it by ratifying the protocol or not. U.S. prisons would be subject to inspections only if it chose to do so. Washington's resistance will probably be futile. A U.S. attempt to reopen negotiations in July was voted down, and the torture protocol is likely to be adopted by a large majority. America has nothing to gain by trying to undermine this important human rights initiative and positioning itself alongside some of the world's worst violators. It should drop its opposition to the torture protocol and, even if unwilling to join, let other nations carry on the fight against torture.","United States, Global","United Nations"

The interpreter was reluctant, but finally did. Was it true what people were saying? That the U.S. would release a gas in Baghdad to put the populace to sleep, then snatch President Saddam Hussein and his henchmen without the need for bombs? """"If only it could be so easy,"""" I replied, laughing. Her face fell. She had clearly been clinging to the hope that a bloodless coup was possible, one in which her many relatives in Baghdad would escape unscathed. It's not just Iraqis who don't want to face the very real likelihood of widespread civilian casualties resulting from U.S. military action. Debate in America has focused on polarizing questions about the propriety of preemption, the wisdom of forcing regime change and the strength of the evidence concerning Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. But whether one favors or opposes war (my organization, Human Rights Watch, is neutral on that issue), it is equally important to consider the grave dangers the Iraqi people could face once war starts, and to develop workable strategies to minimize those dangers. The risk of civilian casualties from the fighting itself is likely to be particularly high in Iraq. Hussein will almost certainly attempt to draw the U.S. into an urban battle, one in which Iraqi civilians are used as human shields. Anyone who remembers the intense fighting in Jenin several months ago, or the bloody 1993 battle of Mogadishu, Somalia, depicted in the movie """"Black Hawk Down,"""" realizes what dangers urban warfare represents. In addition, despite significant technological improvements during the last decade, the Pentagon continues to make deadly mistakes from the air, often by relying on inaccurate intelligence. Finally, U.S. willingness to target and destroy civilian infrastructure such as water treatment facilities is likely to cause many casualties; during the first Gulf War, more civilians died as a result of this practice than were killed directly by the bombs. In Iraq, civilian casualties caused by U.S. military actions would probably be only a part of the picture. The greatest threat to the Iraqi people could well come from the Iraqi army. The direct civilian death toll of allied military action during the Gulf War, Kosovo and Afghanistan combined is dwarfed by the estimated 30,000 who died during Hussein's repression of the 1991 uprisings, or by the estimated 100,000 Kurds killed in his genocidal Al Anfal campaign in the late 1980s. Hussein is the only known head of state who has used chemical weapons against his own people -- as he also did against Iranian troops -- and he is likely to do so again in any battle for his life. In Kurdistan last month, the risks to civilians were very clear. My driver took me out to the last house in the dusty Iraqi Kurdish village of Kalak, the last outpost before the border with the rest of Iraq. From the roof of the house, I looked out at Iraqi army troops that have taken up positions on a line of hills a few hundred meters away. Iraq's Kurds, armed with little more than machine guns, stand no chance against the well-equipped Iraqi troops on the hills. The troops are restrained from attacking by the threat of U.S. retaliation. This curb would be removed if the U.S. decided to attack Iraq. It is people like the virtually defenseless villagers of Kalak who would face the wrath of a cornered Hussein. If the United States initiates a war with Iraq, it will have an obligation to do what it can to protect vulnerable Shiite and Kurdish populations from attack. In Kosovo, NATO bombers could do little from the air to protect civilians as the Serbian forces intensified their killing in response to the bombing. The United States cannot allow a repeat of that tragic experience. The safety of Iraqi civilians will be greatly complicated by the fact that there is only a limited humanitarian presence in the country, and that the agencies present are subject to the whims of Baghdad. In Iraqi Kurdistan, I saw almost no preparation for a humanitarian crisis or chemical weapon attacks --partly because Baghdad controls the flow of humanitarian aid to the north. Fleeing civilians may also face closed borders, blocking access to safety. In 1991, tens of thousands of people trying to escape were stuck on the wrong side of the closed Turkish border; some froze to death. Any planning for military action requires the development of a well-funded humanitarian option, and pressure on regional governments to commit to keeping their borders open. War in Iraq could also cause furious interethnic fighting and massive retribution against perceived supporters of Hussein. During my three weeks in Iraqi Kurdistan, I met with dozens of Kurdish and Turkoman families recently expelled by the Iraqi government from the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and now living in miserable conditions in Kurdistan. The Kurds can be expected to return en masse to Kirkuk at the first opportunity -- and they could well decide to retaliate against the Arabs whom Hussein brought in to replace them. There is also likely to be a fierce, and perhaps violent, competition among Arabs, Kurds and possibly Turkish troops over control of the city. It is likely that members of Hussein's Baath Party, his Tikrit clan and his hated security services will face severe retaliation in the immediate aftermath of his fall. To prevent blood baths, the U.S. needs to make absolutely clear to its potential allies among Hussein's opposition that abuses by them will be punished. Such a commitment was not forthcoming in Afghanistan, where the Northern Alliance troops in Mazar-i-Sharif killed hundreds of captured combatants without much worry about being brought to justice. Finally, experience teaches us that the fall of a government creates a security gap. In Afghanistan, U.S. failure to immediately fill that gap allowed the warlords to force their way into positions of control and allowed mass looting and similar abuses. In Kosovo, the victorious Kosovo Liberation Army immediately began killing Serbian and Gypsy civilians whom they suspected of collaboration with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Bringing stability, security and accountable governance to Iraq is a major, long-term commitment, but one that the United States must shoulder when it embarks on such an intervention. The Bush administration appears to be planning for a more ambitious role in Iraq than in Afghanistan -- including the possibility of a long-term military occupation of the country. In that planning, the security of the civilian population, particularly in the chaotic early days after Hussein's fall, must be a paramount U.S. objective.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/11/02/israel/pa-suicide-bombers-commit-crimes-against-humanity","Israel-PA- Suicide Bombers Commit Crimes Against Humanity","Israel/PA: Suicide Bombers Commit Crimes Against Humanity   ","","11/02/2002","(Gaza) - The people responsible for planning and carrying out suicide bombings that deliberately target civilians are guilty of crimes against humanity and should be brought to justice, Human Rights Watch said in a new report today. The 170-page report is the first full-fledged examination of individual criminal responsibility for suicide bombings against civilians in Israel and the Israeli-occupied territories. The report, Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks against Israeli Civilians, also provides the most thorough study to date of the suicide bombing operations of Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), the groups that have claimed responsibility for almost all recent suicide bombings. """"The people who carry out suicide bombings are not martyrs, they're war criminals, and so are the people who help to plan such attacks,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The scale and systematic nature of these attacks sets them apart from other abuses committed in times of conflict. They clearly fall under the category of crimes against humanity."""" Since January 2001, 52 Palestinian suicide bombings have killed some 250 civilians and injured 2,000 more. Well-established principles of international law require that those in authority be held accountable when people under their control commit war crimes or crimes against humanity. Leaders who order such crimes, fail to take reasonable preventive action, or fail to punish the perpetrators are also responsible for such crimes. The top leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad have openly espoused, encouraged, or endorsed suicide bombing attacks against Israeli civilians, and indicated that they have the capacity to stop them from happening. Those leaders, such as Hamas's Shaikh Ahmad Yassin and Khalid Mish`al and Islamic Jihad's Ramadan Shalah, should face criminal investigation for their roles in these crimes. The PFLP has publicly claimed responsibility for suicide bombings and car bombings against civilians. Its leaders appear to exercise control over their occurrence and so warrant criminal investigation. In the case of the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, control and responsibility appears to be centered at local levels, and those responsible should also face criminal investigation. The Human Rights Watch report assesses the role and responsibility of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and President Yasir Arafat regarding suicide bombings against civilians. It concludes that the PA failed to take all available measures to deter such attacks or bring those responsible to justice, and by its failure contributed to an atmosphere of impunity for such crimes. """"The greatest failure of President Arafat and the PA leadership is their unwillingness to deploy the criminal justice system to deter the suicide bombings, particularly in 2001, when the PA was most capable of doing so,"""" Roth said. Roth said the PA's failure to take effective preventive action or to punish perpetrators outside of its control does not meet the criteria of command responsibility under the current state of international law. """"But Arafat and the PA do bear a high degree of political responsibility for the atrocities that occurred,"""" Roth said. The PA has argued that Israeli actions, such as the destruction of PA police and security installations, undermined its capacity to act. But even when that capacity was largely intact, the PA took no effective action to bring to justice those who incited, planned or assisted in carrying out bombings and other attacks on Israeli civilians. Instead, the PA pursued a policy whereby suspects, when they were detained, were not investigated or prosecuted, but typically were soon let out onto the street again. The PA sought to explain these releases by citing the danger to detainees when Israeli forces bombed places of detention. But the PA has not explained why suspects were never investigated or charged, steps that do not depend on holding suspects in places of detention. Human Rights Watch conducted in-depth interviews with PA officials and members of the armed groups, and closely reviewed PA internal documents made public by Israel. On the basis of what was publicly available to date, Human Rights Watch did not find evidence that Arafat or the PA planned, ordered or carried out suicide bombings or other attacks on Israeli civilians, or that they were able to exercise effective control over the actions of the perpetrator groups, including the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades, an off-shoot of Arafat's Fatah movement. Palestinian armed groups and their supporters have pointed to repeated Israeli attacks that have killed and injured Palestinian civilians as justification for the suicide bombings and other attacks on Israeli civilians. The report concludes that these arguments in no way justify reprisals that target or indiscriminately attack civilians. """"The prohibition against targeting civilians doesn't depend on the behavior of one's adversary,"""" Roth said. """"Even in the face of Israeli violations of international law, Palestinian armed groups must refrain from deliberate attacks against civilians."""" The armed groups responsible for these attacks argue that Israel's continuing military occupation, and its vastly superior means of combat, make such attacks their only option. Again, these arguments find no justification whatsoever in international law, which is absolute and unconditional in its prohibition of intentional attacks against civilians. """"Armed conflicts often involve discrepancies of power between adversaries,"""" said Roth. """"Allowing those discrepancies to justify attacking civilians would create an immense loophole in the protections of international humanitarian law."""" Finally, Palestinian armed groups also assert that their targets are not really civilians because """"all Israelis are reservists"""" or because, they say, Israeli residents of settlements have forfeited their civilian status. The report points out that international humanitarian law is clear: reserve members of military forces are combatants only while on active duty, and otherwise benefit from protection as civilians. And while civilian Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza are illegal under international humanitarian law, persons residing there are entitled to protection as civilians except when they are directly participating in hostilities. Human Rights Watch called on all Palestinian armed groups to halt attacks on civilians immediately and unconditionally, and urged the PA to ensure that those in any way responsible for such attacks are brought to justice. Human Rights Watch also urged the PA to undertake a public campaign urging an end suicide bombings and other attacks against civilians and making clear that the PA does not consider as """"martyrs"""" people who die carrying out attacks that deliberately or indiscriminately kill or cause great suffering among civilians.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

His prediction was alarmingly fulfilled as violent clashes between different ethnic groups erupted across the country from 1991 to 1998. However, far from being the spontaneous result of a return to political pluralism, there is clear evidence that the government helped to provoke this ethnic violence for political purposes and did not take adequate steps to prevent it from spiraling out of control. A presidential commission of inquiry was established in 1998 to investigate the so-called """"tribal clashes"""" (inter-ethnic violence), the causes of the violence, the actions of police and other law enforcement agencies in addressing these incidents, and the preparedness and efficacy of law enforcement agencies in preventing and controlling such violence. The commission was to recommend further investigation or prosecution of perpetrators as well as ways to better prevent and control future inter-ethnic attacks. The 1999 report of the commission was finally made public in October 2002. It confirmed that prominent ruling party politicians have fueled multiple incidents of so-called ethnic clashes in Kenya since 1991. The """"Akiwumi report"""" (named after the commission's chair, Justice Akiwumi) was ordered released by a Kenyan court over the objections of the government. The attorney general sought to undercut the report by calling it """"biased"""" and insisting that it be released together with government commentary disputing its findings. The Akiwumi report's release had been long sought by human rights groups in Kenya and victims of the violence. There was a resurgence of interest in the report this year, which HRW helped spark with the publication in May of """"Playing with Fire,"""" a report on weapons proliferation and political violence in Kenya (see June monthly update). At a Nairobi press conference issuing the HRW report, and in numerous interviews in the Kenyan and international media, HRW made a strong call for the Akiwumi report to be released. Renewed attention to the report from the Kenyan media, parliamentarians, and civil society groups followed, helping build pressure for its eventual release. The HRW report, which was mentioned in a recent New York Times article on the forthcoming elections, documented the role of ruling party politicians in armed ethnic violence on Kenya's coast prior to the last general elections, in 1997. Previous Human Rights Watch research, including a 1993 report titled """"Divide and Rule,"""" described the role of the ruling party politicians in fomenting earlier incidents of politically motivated ethnic violence.","Africa, Kenya",""

Displaced persons and refugees and the agencies assisting them are not simply caught in the crossfire of this war, but have become primary focuses of LRA attacks in both Sudan and Uganda. By September 2002, it was estimated that 552,000 Ugandans were displaced or at risk of having no harvest, at least 24,000 Sudanese refugees in Uganda had been forcibly displaced, unknown thousands of southern Sudanese were displaced inside Sudan, and refugee and displaced persons camps and supplies have been looted or burned. Tens of civilians have been killed in this conflict since March 2002 in both northern Uganda and southern Sudan. The LRA has waged a brutal civil war against the Ugandan government since the mid-1980s. The war has had a devastating impact on the Acholi people of northern Uganda, and its human rights abuses have included summary executions, torture and mutilation, recruitment of child soldiers, child sexual abuse, forcible displacement, and looting and destruction of civilian property. The Ugandan government has sought a military solution, deepening the destruction of Acholi society by forcing tens of thousands into displaced persons camps, where they have nevertheless not been safe from LRA attacks and have been subjected to arbitrary arrests, torture including rape, and other abuses by Ugandan army soldiers. In early October 2002, with the renewed LRA offensive, the Ugandan army ordered civilians in the Acholi districts to leave their homes and move closer to these camps. From late 2000, the LRA had largely retreated to southern Sudan, where it maintained its headquarters and training bases and enjoyed the support of the Sudan government. Around the same time, however, the Sudanese government began to end its assistance to this rebel movement, under an agreement with the Ugandan government, which reciprocally agreed to end its support for the Sudanese rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). Seeking food, and moving from its bases near Juba to the more remote Imatong Mountains in Sudan, the LRA looted food from and displaced hundreds of Sudanese families in attacks in southern Sudan in late 2001 and early 2002, causing casualties and destroying villages. In March 2002, the Ugandan People’s Defence Force (UPDF) started a military offensive against the LRA in southern Sudan, “Operation Iron Fist,” with the permission of the Sudanese government. Since then, human rights abuses connected to the war in northern Uganda and southern Sudan have escalated with resulting massive displacement and severe access problems for relief agencies. Escaping from the UPDF in southern Sudan in June 2002, the LRA resumed attacks inside Uganda on camps for internally displaced Ugandans and for Sudanese refugees. In one raid in early August, the LRA attacked a Sudanese refugee camp in Achol-pii, northern Uganda, killing more than fifty refugees. The Ugandan army, lagging behind in Sudan, failed to protect civilians from these attacks in northern Uganda, and resumed previous patterns of arbitrary arrests of civilians suspected of collaborating with the rebels, and of forcible displacement. Some LRA soldiers have remained in southern Sudan, where they have attacked the Sudanese army and a Sudanese government-backed militia, former LRA sponsors. More LRA troops crossed back into southern Sudan in August 2002, in what seemed to be an endless cross-border cycle of violence. The renewed military activity started by Operation Iron Fist has stymied efforts to start peace talks with the LRA undertaken by the local administration in northern Uganda and by a forum of religious leaders. Human Rights Watch calls on the LRA to cease attacks on civilians and civilian objects and release all underage soldiers and those forcibly conscripted while underage; and on the Ugandan government to relocate refugee and displaced persons camps a safe distance from the theater of war, take effective measures to protect civilians, and respect the human rights of Acholi civilians in northern Uganda.. The Sudan government and SPLA should also protect Sudanese civilians from attack by the LRA. The international community must insist that all parties cease targeting civilians and provide immediate and unimpeded access for humanitarian activities both in southern Sudan and northern Uganda. “Operation Iron Fist” The Sudan government had supported the LRA in retaliation for the Ugandan government’s support of the SPLM/A, which has been fighting the Sudanese government since 1983. The presidents of the two countries agreed in 1999 to end support of these two groups and to restore normal diplomatic relations. The Sudan government was also motivated, after September 11, 2001, to disassociate itself from the LRA, deemed a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department. By then, Khartoum had already started to cut off food, medicine, and other support for the LRA inside Sudan, even though the Ugandan government had not taken any visible steps to cut off aid to the SPLA. The LRA had largely retreated into Sudan after an outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Gulu, northern Uganda, in late 2000, and northern Uganda became relatively quiet. The Sudan government’s cutback of aid to the LRA weakened the rebel group but did not lead to its disintegration. To survive, the LRA attacked and looted southern Sudanese villages for food. Wary of the Sudan government’s intentions, the LRA began moving from its bases south of Juba to Upper Talanga, a remote area of the Imatong Mountains on the Sudan/Uganda border, sometime in 2001. In March 2002, the Sudan government gave the UPDF permission to enter Sudanese territory in order to capture and destroy the LRA. The UPDF, which had been saying in 2000 that it was “ready” to chase the LRA out of southern Sudan, called this “Operation Iron Fist.” This brought the Ugandan civil war inside Sudan, with several thousand troops from the LRA and more than ten thousand UPDF soldiers conducting operations to the detriment of tens of thousands of southern Sudanese civilians, who already had the Sudanese civil war to cope with. The LRA rebels managed to avoid the more slowly moving UPDF in the rough terrain of southern Sudan—with which the LRA was familiar and the UPDF not. The Ugandan government’s minister for the north conceded to Human Rights Watch in July 2002 that Operation Iron Fist was a failure: the UPDF did not militarily defeat the LRA in Sudan. Indeed, the campaign had the effect of driving the LRA back into Uganda: in June 2002 the LRA left a small number of forces in the Imatong Mountains and returned to northern Uganda. In late June 2002, the LRA attacked several small camps of Sudan government soldiers in El Jebelien, Sudan, about forty-five kilometers southeast of Juba, and along the road between Juba and Torit, Sudan. Shortly after, on July 1, President Bashir of Sudan announced for the first time that the Sudan army had joined the UPDF in the anti-LRA offensive inside Sudan. In early August, after the LRA attacked a Sudanese refugee camp in northern Uganda, killing at least fifty people, the UPDF launched a large-scale military operation against the LRA on the Sudan/Uganda border. Joseph Kony, the LRA leader, was alleged to have fled to the Imatong Mountains in southern Sudan at that time, with other LRA remaining in the border area. On August 31, 2002, the SPLA, which was not a party to the UPDF-LRA fighting in its territory, captured the Sudanese government garrison town of Torit in Eastern Equatoria, southern Sudan, just north of the area of LRA and UPDF fighting. In late September, the Sudan government bombed the UPDF in Palotaka, southern Sudan, to the south of Torit. The Sudanese government later said the bombing of the UPDF was an “accident” and that the Sudanese pilots had been aiming at the SPLA. It questioned what UPDF troops were doing in such close contact with the SPLA. One Sudanese government spokesman said that “an unidentified neighboring country” helped the SPLA capture Torit. Despite this incident, another Sudan government spokesman maintained that Sudan-Uganda relations were in “good shape.” In late September, the LRA attacked Liria, a Ugandan town well south of the Acholi area. This was its first attack so far south. By October 2, 2002, the Ugandan government announced that some 100,000 civilians had to move away from their homes, closer to camps controlled by the government. It gave them forty-eight hours to move. The government denied that it was having trouble “flushing out” the LRA rebels. LRA Abuses in Sudan In 2001 and 2002, hundreds of Sudanese Acholi and other families were displaced as the LRA attacked their villages in southern Sudan, and looted and burned their property. They fled, destitute, to Labone and Nimule, larger villages in SPLA-held southern Sudan, according to relief workers. Southerners had not been safe from the LRA, even in previous years: in January 2000 the LRA killed two relief workers for Norwegian Church Aid inside Sudan. The affected areas—south of Juba, east of the Nile, and south of Torit in Eastern Equatoria, all in southern Sudan—are a patchwork of territories variously controlled by the Sudan government army, the government militia Equatorian Defense Force (EDF) and other government militia, and the SPLA. This area has been subjected to a Sudanese government flight ban imposed on the humanitarian community for about three years, and the creation of new internally displaced persons there added to the misery that was largely out of international reach and sight. LRA abuses against southern Sudanese escalated after Operation Iron Fist started. In early April 2002, the LRA attacked Sudan government-controlled villages, and military posts, near Juba, the largest Sudan government garrison town in the south, causing thousands to flee to displaced persons camps nearer Juba. The villagers reported to relief officials that their homes had been looted and burned by the LRA, they believed in retaliation for Sudan’s support for the UPDF. At the same time, some 2,000 people fled from Juba to the south for safety, according to the World Food Program (WFP). Many LRA fled from the UPDF and possibly from the Sudan army to the safety of the Imatong Mountains, east of their Juba-area bases, looting along the way. As the UPDF was moving troops, heavy artillery, tanks, and armored personnel carriers into Sudan, the LRA was looting and razing to the ground at least six villages, according to the Catholic church in the area just across from the Uganda border. The church estimated that the LRA had killed more than 470 southern Sudanese civilians in these and other Imatong villages, and displaced more than 500 others from a displaced persons camp in Imatong Center in one week in late April-early May 2002. Included in the dead were 350 Sudanese civilians living in Katire, mostly elderly, women, and children, killed with LRA machetes starting from April 26. The LRA robbed, looted, and ransacked the village and surrounding hamlets of all food and valuables. According to the Catholic Diocese of Torit, fifty of the dead were allegedly members of the EDF led by Cmdr. Martin Kenjii. The EDF has in the past participated in LRA training and assistance on behalf of the Sudan government. Many in the EDF were Sudanese Acholis. However, the relationship between the EDF and LRA was strained by LRA attacks on southern villages inhabited by Acholi and other civilians who “belonged” to the EDF. In a separate attack, also denounced by the Catholic church in the area, the LRA raided at least three villages around Lokodi, which they burned to the ground, killing men and boys and raping young girls; some families were stripped of their clothing and locked in their homes for four days, during which time they were forced to drink their own urine to survive. On May 9, 2002, the Sudanese government, through its governor in Juba, ordered civilians to vacate areas currently occupied by the LRA, calling on them to run for safety to several named towns, according to a Sudanese government press report. The Sudanese government, however, made no attempt to offer protection to civilians outside its garrison towns, even though the LRA was based in its army and militia-controlled territory. A few NGOs tried with minimal resources to provide for thousands of newly displaced civilians inside southern Sudan, both in the garrison towns and in SPLA areas. By June 2002, there were approximately 4,500 internally displaced Sudanese in Ikotos, an SPLA-controlled area of Eastern Equatoria, in poor conditions, having just fled the LRA-UPDF fighting in the Imatong Mountains, according to a United Nations (U.N.) official. On August 15, 2002, the LRA attacked Gumbo and Rejaf, located also in Sudanese government-controlled territory just southeast of Juba. In Gumbo displaced persons camp, the Sudanese government patrol engaged the LRA. According to U.N. sources, the LRA abducted two internally displaced persons and killed two Sudan government soldiers. One LRA soldier was killed. In Rejaf village the LRA killed one woman and looted cattle. After one of the displaced abductees reportedly returned with a threatening note from the LRA, the displaced persons in Gumbo camp began to spend the night in Gumbo village. On August 24, the LRA attacked Gumbo village, killing one policeman. An LRA soldier was killed and five LRA injured as the Sudan government responded to the attack, and the internally displaced fled to Juba. On September 9, a delegation of chiefs and elders from Rejaf called on Sudanese authorities in Juba, complaining of LRA harassment and theft from their farms in daylight. The villagers slept in the bush at night for fear of more LRA attacks.  Despite the displacement caused by this military activity, the government of Sudan has kept in place the three-year flight ban it has imposed on the affected area, preventing access to the U.N. and NGOs working through the U.N.-coordinated relief effort Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS)-Southern Sector, based in Lokichokkio and Nairobi, Kenya. The land route to northern Uganda, through which OLS could access some Sudanese border towns, such as Nimule and Labone, also became unsafe as the LRA moved back into Uganda. In addition, on September 27, the Sudan government imposed a ban on all flights going into Western and Eastern Equatoria in southern Sudan from neighboring Kenya or Uganda, putting extra pressure on the southern Sudanese displaced inside Sudan by LRA attacks. The ban was to be lifted on October 7. LRA Abuses in Uganda After leaving southern Sudan and re-establishing itself in northern Uganda in mid-2002, the LRA resumed large-scale attacks on the UPDF and the northern Ugandan population. The LRA’s small contingent inside Uganda, left when it departed in late 2000, had sporadically attacked Ugandan Acholi displaced persons and Sudanese refugee camps, and ambushed vehicles on northern Ugandan roads, but had engaged in no major campaigns inside Uganda for a period of about eighteen months. The Ugandan area traditionally subject to attack by the LRA comprises the three Acholi districts of northern Uganda—Kitgum, Gulu, and Pader. The LRA has also attacked Sudanese refugee camps in the Adjumani district to the west of the Acholi. From June 2002, the LRA started again, in many small and large units, to loot and burn Ugandan villages in these districts, camps for internally displaced persons established by the government, and Sudanese refugee camps, and to kill Ugandan Acholi civilians while abducting others for short-term portering and recruitment. It operated in units with effective communications and evident central command and control, suggesting good equipment and training. Its targets also included UPDF personnel, installations, and equipment. In July 2002, the U.N. resident coordinator in Kampala (the Ugandan capital) reported that LRA soldiers had recently attacked sixteen camps for internallly displaced personss in northern Uganda (Gulu, Kitgum, and Pader districts), further displacing an estimated 50,000 people. On July 24 and 25, LRA soldiers killed an estimated fifty-seven people with machetes twenty-two kilometers from Kitgum town, in four villages of Mucwini sub-county. The survivors fled into Kitgum trading center and town for safety. In some of the attacks, such as in Bungatira on July 22, the LRA used landmines (a newly-introduced weapon) to threaten civilians to leave their homes; in Bungatira the rebels then burned sixty huts. The LRA, in its attacks on Ugandan Acholi internally displaced persons camps, sometimes first warned the residents to evacuate the camps or else face the LRA. It did this in Palabek, Kitgum district, on July 20. On July 25, it attacked the Palabek Gem camp, looted some shops and the food supplies distributed by the WFP the day before, and abducted the headmaster of the school with all his family. In mid-August 2002, the LRA announced that all humanitarian agencies working in northern Uganda—most assigned to internallly displaced persons camps—had to withdraw, or risk becoming targets of new attacks. Despite this warning, relief agencies continued operations, although with scaled back staff and assets and few trips to the camps. The LRA also targeted Sudanese refugees in Uganda. There are some 180,000 refugees in Uganda, according to the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), of whom 87 percent or 156,500 are Sudanese, almost all in refugee camps in northern Uganda not far from the Sudan border. In Pader district, LRA forces raided the Achol-pii camp for Sudanese refugees on August 5, killing approximately fifty people in a confrontation with the Ugandan army, including four UPDF soldiers and two Ugandan policemen. Eleven LRA rebels were killed in the clash. The LRA also abducted five aid workers from the International Rescue Committee (IRC), releasing them after five nights of captivity; on the second day demands were made in exchange for their lives. The LRA looted all the relief food recently delivered to Achol-pii camp, and burned what it could not carry; it also burned dwellings, vehicles, and administration buildings, forcing the camp’s 24,000 Sudanese refugees and relief staff to flee the site. Some refugees fled back to Sudan, but the majority fled to non-Acholi areas of Uganda. The UNHCR began to settle these displaced refugees into alternative sites in other parts of the country. Most Sudanese refugees in Uganda live in Adjumani district, which is west of the three Acholi districts in northern Uganda. On July 8, 2002, in an LRA attack on the Maaji camp (housing 11,000 refugees) in Adjumani district, LRA soldiers killed five Sudanese refugees, abducted five, and burned a grinding mill, five classrooms, and 127 houses. On September 9, more than eighty LRA forces attacked seven refugee sites in Maaji camp again. According to U.N. sources, the LRA injured one woman, abducted nineteen others (of whom eight returned), and 6,000 refugees fled; the UNHCR moved them temporarily to a transit center. The day before this second attack on the refugee camp, 200 LRA troops attacked the town of Adjumani in its biggest raid since Achol-pii, looting shops, burning dozens of houses, and abducting more than fifty people. The LRA’s behavior has changed since it left Uganda in 2000: in previous years, the LRA carried out mutilations of those it believed to be government informers and others, and in 2002 this no longer seemed to be the case. In addition, relief workers in northern Uganda observed in 2002 that the LRA conscripted fewer people, adults and children—perhaps because it had lost its safe rear bases in Sudan where it trained them. In 2002, the LRA continued, however, to abduct some people apparently on account of their suspected government connections. And Acholi Ugandan children were still abducted, despite the fact that overall abductions were down. One boy of seventeen told an organization working with children in northern Uganda of being abducted by the LRA on the night of August 13, 2002. He was marched around for nine days, during which time it rained and he and the other women and children abductees were barefoot and slept in the cold bush without a blanket. He was taught how to dismantle, clean, and assemble a gun, and witnessed the summary execution of two government local defense men, wounded, who were killed with an axe and panga (long knife). An abducted boy caught escaping was executed in front of all the abductees with a knife on the barrel of a gun. The LRA has not stopped brutalizing its captives. LRA Interference with Relief Activities With the increasing displacement of Acholi Ugandans from rural areas into towns, the need for food assistance in the three districts in northern Uganda escalated. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA) projected in September 2002 that 522,000 displaced people would lose their current harvest and the smaller second harvest as they did not have access to their fields. They would be in need of food aid for another year. Prior to the return of the LRA in June 2002, the WFP was providing 30 percent of the nutritional needs of 520,000 persons in the Acholi region. The WFP was forced to suspend food deliveries there for one month in June 2002, however, due to the return of the LRA to northern Uganda and the resultant insecurity. This resulted in a dramatic increase in levels of malnutrition among displaced children. WFP deliveries resumed on July 15 with increased UPDF protection, but still subject to frequent LRA attacks on relief vehicles. After the return of the LRA, the WFP assessed that it needed to deliver 100 percent of the food needs of the huge population in its care. In August, despite some deliveries of food aid to outlying areas and resumption of some non-food item deliveries in the Acholi region, the situation remained tense and many displaced remained beyond reach because of insecurity. The congestion in the hospitals and towns of overnight refuge seekers diminished. But the displaced were still crowded into inadequate conditions of health and safety and shelter at a time when relief agencies had to scale down their activities because of insecurity. On September 6, the LRA ambushed a truck belonging to British NGO ACORD, loaded with non-food items for the displaced going from Gulu to Kitgum. It killed the driver and burned the entire contents of the truck, worth U.S.$6,000. On September 14, 2002, a WFP convoy of eight commercial trucks carrying 300 tons of food aid and clearly marked with WFP flags was ambushed by the LRA en route to Kitgum. One driver was killed and the UPDF escorting the convoy and the LRA exchanged fire, causing the LRA to flee. The food was not stolen. The trucks proceeded to Kitgum but the food was not distributed to locations outside Kitgum for fear of further attack, and the WFP suspended its activities in two of the three districts until further notice. LRA Child Soldiers The LRA has a long history of abduction of children from northern Uganda who were brutalized and marched to LRA bases in southern Sudan where they were trained and inducted into the LRA. Girls were sexually abused, and many kept as soldiers’ and officers’ “wives” or concubines. The LRA has abducted an estimated ten to twelve thousand children under age eighteen, one third of the total abductions, since it began its mobilization. Of these, one third were under age twelve when abducted. Recruitment of children is prohibited under international law and can constitute a war crime. In mid-2002, when the LRA returned to Uganda, a rumor circulated that the LRA was seeking to abduct children under twelve years of age. Fearing a repetition of the abductions, northern Ugandans living in smaller villages and displaced camps sent their children to spend the nights in nearby towns. Churches, hospitals, and schools filled to overflowing with children as young as four years. At Gulu’s main hospital alone, some forty thousand villagers were sheltering nightly during the month of July. The sleeping, sanitary, and social conditions for them were appalling and disease spread. These children vanished back to their homes at dawn. Aid agencies had expected an influx of escaping child soldiers once the LRA returned to Uganda: in early 2002, it was estimated that about five to six thousand child soldiers remained with the LRA (of the original ten to twelve thousand abducted). Extensive preparations to receive them (tents, food, etc.) were launched. However, very few child soldiers materialized/escaped during Operation Iron Fist, to date. Some observers concluded that most of the captive children who had not escaped by 2002 (thousands had escaped and passed through rehabilitation centers maintained in northern Uganda) were long dead of disease, LRA punishment, or war. It was roughly estimated that the LRA’s total forces, including underage soldiers and other children, numbered only in the one to three thousand range in 2002. In addition, the LRA appeared to have been stung by broad international condemnation of its abuses. On June 12, 2002, it released about one hundred sick, elderly, and women with young children as it crossed into Uganda from Sudan. UPDF Abuses in Uganda Since 1996, the UDPF has forced thousands of Ugandan civilians in the Acholi north of the country to move into camps, in addition to those who went willingly for protection from the LRA. In early October 2002 it ordered some 100,000 northern Ugandans to move next to displaced persons camps or towns for protection. Some of these Ugandans had already been displaced. While Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, the international law governing internal armed conflict, allows for civilians to be moved if “the security of the civilians so involved or imperative military reasons so demand” (article 17), this forcible displacement has not in practice improved the security of those moved, and rather, seems designed to control the population. There are some 584,000 internally displaced persons in Uganda, of whom more than half (356,000) are in the northern Gulu district. The camps have provided little or no protection from the LRA and were also vulnerable to abuse by the UPDF and individual soldiers. Human Rights Focus (HURIFO), a Gulu-based human rights organization, published a report on the plight of internally displaced persons in northern Uganda in February 2002, documenting forcible recruitment by the UPDF of child soldiers and underage “Home Guard” self-defense militia from the displaced persons’ camps. Arbitrary arrests, killings, torture, rape, and other abuses by the Ugandan forces were documented in this report, as well as abuses by the LRA. In April 2001, one man in the Opit camp was arrested for suspected links to the LRA, hung upside down from a tree, and beaten by UPDF soldiers. Other displaced persons reported similar mistreatment at the hands of the UPDF. At the army barracks in Gulu, an estimated thirty civilians were arbitrarily detained by the Ugandan government. In response to the LRA’s new campaign in northern Uganda, the UPDF stepped up the existing pattern of arbitrary long-term detentions of civilians suspected of collaborating with the LRA. Since humanitarian agencies had limited access and resources and the displaced had few farming opportunities, living conditions in the camps were very poor. The UPDF, overstretched by Operation Iron Fist inside Sudan, offered minimal protection from the renewed LRA attacks in 2002 to people in Ugandan displaced persons camps, villages, and Sudanese refugee camps. Often, UPDF soldiers told the civilians to fend for themselves as the UPDF numbers were too low to provide any protection; in other cases, UPDF soldiers ran when the LRA approached, according to civilians interviewed by members of parliament from northern Uganda and journalists in July 2002. The LRA had often attacked Sudanese refugee camps, and relief and human rights organizations had sought the relocation of the camps elsewhere inside Uganda, without success. The Ugandan government, as of January 2001, required all newly arriving Sudanese refugees to register in the Sudanese refugee camps in northern Uganda. Since the return of the LRA to northern Uganda, and its resumption of targeted attacks on Sudanese refugee camps, those camps are no longer safe for refugees. Prospects for the Future In northern Uganda, both the LRA and the UPDF continue to commit abuses. The LRA attacks internally displaced camps and villages and Sudanese refugee camps, burning and looting property, and killing civilians. The UPDF and the Ugandan government seem intent on further displacing civilians into larger and larger camps—by, for instance, requiring food deliveries for two camps to be made at a single camp, thus encouraging displaced to move to the one camp—while protection remains poor. The Ugandan government’s maintenance of Sudanese refugee camps in an unsafe area near the border, and its requirement that all Sudanese refugees (but not other nationalities of refugees in Uganda) register in such camps, puts refugees at risk. Continuing LRA activities in Sudan threaten Sudanese civilians with death, displacement, and destruction. For years, civil society leaders in northern Uganda, most prominently the “Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative,” have called for a peaceful solution to the conflict through negotiations. In July 2002, highly-placed Acholi civil society leaders, with the permission of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, were engaged in “talks about talks” with the highest-ranking LRA officers immediately under Kony. The rebels wanted a ceasefire prior to peace talks. In a letter of July 20, 2002 conveyed by the civil society leaders to the LRA, President Museveni offered a ceasefire on condition the LRA stop kidnappings, attacks on civilians, soldiers, and transport, and canton its troops in specified areas in southern Sudan (the Owiny Kibul, Panyikwara and Aswa valley areas) for a few weeks, while negotiations were carried out. Ugandan government officials sometimes referred to the northern Uganda conflict as “Acholi killing themselves.” Some officials noted that no rebel force could exist in that area if the civilians did not want them there. However, the UPDF has prosecuted its war with the LRA in a manner that disregarded the rights of civilians in northern Uganda, and even targeted some for ill-treatment in violation of human rights. On August 23, President Museveni “pitched camp” in Gulu to oversee the crisis. He designated a government team for negotiations with the rebels, and in discussions both parties agreed to a ceasefire, but as of this writing nothing has been agreed upon. Recommendations The government of Uganda should take all practical steps to stop its abuses and actions that endanger civilians:  The government should not order displacement for reasons related to the conflict unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand. Should such displacements have to be carried out, all possible measures should be taken in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter, hygiene, health, safety and nutrition. When considering the safety of displaced persons camps, the government should weigh the security risks inherent in creating a potential target for LRA attack against the potential security benefits. Since the only stated governmental purpose for displacement and creation of the displaced persons camps in northern Uganda has been to provide protection for the civilians, if the Ugandan government is unable to do so, the camps should be moved to a safe location outside northern Uganda, the theatre of the LRA war. A recommendation that the camps be provided with enough security is not useful at this time as the government has been asked to do this for years and either has not done it or has not been able to do it to the extent required. Sudanese refugee camps should be moved to a safer place farther from the Sudan border, and Sudanese refugees should be permitted to seek asylum in Uganda’s towns and cities, rather than being forced to apply solely in refugee camps in strife-torn northern Uganda. The Ugandan government must stop recruiting children as soldiers, home guards or other auxiliary forces. Wherever possible the Ugandan government should spare LRA child soldiers and apply international standards for escaped, captured, or demobilized children. The Ugandan government should provide for an arrest process that guarantees fair trial rights and puts the judiciary in charge of the extension of detention periods longer than forty-eight hours. Those not tried within a reasonable period should be released without charges. The Ugandan government should vigorously investigate and punish all acts of torture and ill-treatment of detainees.  The LRA should cease its abuses of the civilian population in Uganda and Sudan, including:  Stop attacks on civilians and civilian objects, and refrain from attacking military objectives if excessive civilian losses would result; cease indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian objects including killing, looting, and destruction of civilian property. Stop forced portering and conscription. Release all persons younger than eighteen years of age and permit all persons forcibly recruited into the LRA (when they were less than eighteen years of age) to choose whether to return to their homes, and allow monitoring of this process by national and international nongovernmental organizations or by the U.N. Stop attacks on relief vehicles and personnel.  The Sudan government should:  Immediately lift its ban on relief agency flights (by the U.N. and others) into southern Sudan, particularly the area east of the Nile and south of the Juba-Torit line, and permit free movement for humanitarian operations. The Sudan government and allied militias and the SPLA should:  Take all necessary steps to protect Sudanese civilians from the effects of the LRA war inside Sudan.  The international community should:  Press the Ugandan and Sudanese governments to fulfill these conditions, and maintain pressure for the LRA and the UPDF to respect human rights and humanitarian law and in particular demobilize all child soldiers (including those adults abducted or recruited as children) in their ranks. Take steps to ensure that any peace agreement proposed for the solution of the conflict in northern Uganda must include enforceable measures to protect and respect human rights, including provisions against impunity for past crimes. Insist that all parties provide immediate and unimpeded access for humanitarian activities both in southern Sudan and northern Uganda, where the needs have skyrocketed.","Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda","Crisis and Conflict"

FTAA negotiations continue this week with the Seventh Ministerial Meeting in Quito, Ecuador, with the United States taking a leading role in pushing stronger patent protection for medicines. Drug patenting is currently governed by the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement (TRIPS), which requires WTO member states to grant twenty-year patent protection on all technological innovations, including HIV/AIDS drugs. According to a consensus reached at the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the WTO in Doha, Qatar in November, 2001, TRIPS supports WTO members’ right to promote universal access to essential medicines. For example, TRIPS allows countries to override patents if they pay a reasonable royalty to the patent-holder or declare a national emergency. But the FTAA draft contains numerous restrictions on this practice, depriving states of a crucial means of guaranteeing access to essential HIV/AIDS drugs and fulfilling their international obligations to ensure their populace the highest attainable standard of health. The U.S. attempts to make the FTAA rules more protective than the WTO are known as “TRIPS-plus” and have sparked opposition from AIDS treatment advocates around the world. “No one, including the United States, doubts the importance of overriding patents in times of public health emergency,” said Jonathan Cohen, researcher with Human Rights Watch’s HIV/AIDS and Human Rights Program. “If this were anthrax in the U.S. postal service and not AIDS in the developing world, the United States would be using every emergency provision TRIPS has to offer, and then some.” The FTAA comes at a critical juncture in the global struggle against HIV/AIDS, just as countries in Latin America and the Caribbean are beginning to increase access to AIDS treatment. Brazil, fighting pressure from the United States and its drug companies, has reduced AIDS-related mortality by more than 50 percent by guaranteeing state-funded antiretroviral treatment. The public sectors in Argentina, Costa Rica and Uruguay, all parties to the FTAA, have begun to provide free antiretroviral treatment to their AIDS-affected populations. The inability to relax patent protection and produce generic AIDS drugs could have a devastating long term impact on these countries’ AIDS programs. “FTAA negotiations will set the standard for trade accords all over the world,” said Cohen. “If parties to the agreement are concerned about ensuring the right to HIV/AIDS treatment, they will reject increased patent protection and use every tool at their disposal to expand access to essential drugs.”","Americas, Global, United States","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/10/25/action-urged-regarding-non-cooperation-ictr-and-icty","Action urged regarding non-cooperation with ICTR and ICTY","Action urged regarding non-cooperation with ICTR and ICTY","Letter to Security Council Members","10/25/2002","Members of the UN Security Council  Your Excellency:  Next week, reports are due to the Security Council on the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (the ICTR)and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Both Tribunals are experiencing serious problems because governments are refusing to honor their legally binding obligation to cooperate as established by the Security Council resolutions and the Statutes of the Tribunals. It is imperative that the Security Council support the Tribunals and reiterate the obligation of all United Nations Member States to cooperate fully with them. These instances of non-cooperation put the burden on the Security Council to act decisively to ensure compliance with its own resolutions in support of international justice. Non-cooperation with the ICTY Regarding the ICTY, we are concerned about the lack of cooperation by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) on several fronts. Key among the obligations to cooperate is the obligation to arrest and transfer an accused found on a state's territory. A disturbing number of people indicted by the ICTY are still at large in the FRY, including, most notably, Ratko Mladic. Mladic, former military commander of the Bosnian Serbs, has been charged with genocide in connection with the Srebrenica massacre where more than 7,000 persons are believed to have been killed or executed. Other indictees still at large in the FRY include a sitting President of Serbia and three former Yugoslav army officers. Also believed to be in the FRY are several Bosnian Serbs accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and, in the case of one accused, genocide against Bosnian Muslims in Srebrenica, Sarajevo, Foca, and Visegrad, during the 1992-95 war. We also share the concern expressed by the Tribunal about provisions of the FRY's law on cooperation that purport to limit the government's obligations to cooperate with the ICTY to cases in which indictments were issued prior to passage of the law. We appreciate the important role that domestic war crimes trials may play as a complement to ICTY proceedings. And the Office of the Prosecutor has clearly indicated its intention to refer appropriate cases to domestic courts. At the same time, it must be made clear to the FRY authorities that their U.N. commitments oblige them to cooperate with the ICTY in cases in which the Tribunal determines to exercise its jurisdiction, regardless of the date the indictment is issued. We are also concerned by the FRY's persistent unwillingness to provide to the Tribunal documents in its military archives.  Although the Security Council has not been seized with Croatia's lack of cooperation, we also want to highlight Zabreb's failure to arrest and transfer retired general Janko Bobetko, indicted by the tribunal on August 23 for war crimes committed against Croatian Serbs in 1993. The Croatian government has tried to justify its refusal to surrender Bobetko by citing the Croatian constitution, but national constitutions cannot supersede legal obligations imposed by the Security Council. We are also troubled by Croatia's failure to facilitate the apprehension of former Croatian general Ante Gotovina, indicted in July 2001 for crimes during and after Operation Storm, the 1995 military operation that left several hundred thousand Croatian Serbs as refugees. Gotovina is believed to have been in Croatia over the course of the past year since his indictment. The President of Croatia, Stipe Mesic, has been the only Croatian official publicly supporting full cooperation with The Hague in this matter, but he lacks executive authority to ensure cooperation.  Non-cooperation with the ICTR On July 23, 2002, the ICTR prosecutor reported to the Security Council that the government of Rwanda was not cooperating with the Tribunal in several areas, including facilitating the travel of witnesses and providing access to documentary materials. According to the prosecutor, these problems began shortly after she announced that several of the Rwanda Patriotic Army (RPA) soldiers would soon be indicted for atrocities committed in 1994. By refusing cooperation, the Rwandan government intended to pressure the prosecutor to end or at least suspend investigations into RPA atrocities. Under Resolution 955 (1994), the Security Council empowered the Tribunal to investigate such crimes, including """"systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law.""""  In 1994, the RPA killed thousands of civilians, in the process committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. These crimes have been well-documented, including by a U.N. Commission of Experts, which concluded that the RPA had """"perpetrated serious breaches of international humanitarian law"""" and """"crimes against humanity.""""  The Rwandan government has agreed that crimes were committed but has said that it has conducted or will conduct its own prosecutions of them. In the six years since it was established, this government has brought to justice only a few dozen RPA soldiers accused of war crimes. Most of those found guilty have received minimal sentences. Rwandan authorities recently instituted gacaca jurisdictions for popular justice. Although the law establishing these courts provides for them to try war crimes and crimes against humanity as well as genocide, Rwandan authorities have directed them to consider only cases of genocide- that is, crimes by forces other than the RPA.  In recent weeks, the Rwandan government has increased its cooperation to the extent of permitting some witnesses to travel to Arusha to testify. In an apparently related development, the prosecutor has in fact suspended investigation of RPA crimes. If the partial reduction in obstacles to the travel of witnesses results from an explicit or implicit quid pro quo, these developments represent a serious infringement of the independence of the prosecutor. The Rwandan government has also submitted to the Council its own complaints about the operations of the ICTR. Certainly there are aspects of ICTR operations that could and should be improved, but a government cannot be permitted to take failings in the operation of a U.N. institution as an excuse for not fulfilling Chapter VII obligations to cooperate with that institution.  If the Security Council chooses to address operational problems of the ICTR, it should treat this issue apart from the far weightier problem of governmental non-cooperation, a problem now hampering both institutions created by the Council.  Human Rights Watch urges the Security Council to take consistent action supporting both Tribunals. The Security Council should adopt language reminding all states of their obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunals. I thank you for your attention. HRW remains at your service should you desire further background on this important matter.

Despite the change from military to civilian government in 1999, there is still widespread deployment of army, navy and paramilitary Mobile Police at oil facilities across the delta. Much greater sums of money are flowing from the federal government to the delta region, but ordinary people living in the delta see little if any benefit from these funds, Human Rights Watch said.   Discontent among the people of the delta remains high, with both the government and the oil companies. Occupations of oil facilities and other protests directed at the oil companies continue unabated.   The 40-page report, """"The Niger Delta: No Democratic Dividend,"""" considers several recent violent incidents around oil facilities, and concludes that both the government and the oil company have failed to fulfill their responsibilities. Security forces continue to commit human rights violations with impunity in response to protests and acts of violence at oil facilities. The oil companies remain complicit in many such abuses despite their stated commitment to respect human rights.   """"The Nigerian government still seems to support oil production at any cost,"""" said Bronwen Manby, deputy director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"And the oil companies too often go along with whatever the government does - or even make things worse.""""   In one case examined in the report, naval personnel carried out a reprisal raid on a village where oil company employees were taken hostage, destroying several dozen houses and killing several people. In another, money paid by an oil company to a community representative has apparently been used by that person to """"hire"""" police to harass and arrest members of an opposing faction in the village.   The international oil companies have in recent years also greatly increased the amount of money they spend on community development projects and compensation. But in most cases they have taken insufficient care to monitor the use made of their money. In particular, they have failed to ensure that it does not reinforce factional violence between those who benefit and those who do not. The oil companies also continue to fail to monitor closely security force activity at or near their facilities or where work is being carried out on their behalf, or, in many cases, to intervene with the authorities when abuses are committed.   Among the recommendations of Human Rights Watch:  The government should fully investigate and prosecute members of the security forces and the responsible civilian authorities who are implicated in human rights violations in the oil producing areas. These include those responsible for abuses in Ogoniland from 1993 to 1998, including the 1995 execution of author Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority rights activists, and at Odi in November 1999, when soldiers destroyed the town, in Bayelsa State, killing hundreds of people.  Members of the Group of 8 (G8) industrialized countries should take steps towards the creation of a binding code of conduct for multinational oil companies headquartered in the G8 countries or member states of the European Union. It should be based on initiatives to develop such codes within the United Nations, the U.S./U.K. Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and appropriate human rights standards. The G8 should require transnational corporations to publish all net taxes, fees, royalties and other payments made to the Nigerian state. Oil companies should monitor the behavior of both public law enforcement agencies and private security deployed at or near to oil facilities, and raise concerns privately and publicly with the appropriate authorities. They should also ensure credible third-party audits of payments of any kind given to community representatives. """"This week is the anniversary of an army massacre of more than two hundred civilians in Benue State, in central eastern Nigeria,"""" said Manby. """"Just as in the case of the destruction of Odi and the abuses in Ogoniland, there has been no accountability for these killings, and President Obasanjo has refused to take action against those alleged to be responsible.""""","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/10/21/fight-good-fight","Fight the Good Fight","Fight the Good Fight","","10/21/2002","Before joining the US in a war on Iraq, Blair must lay down the law on key human rights principles. If he doesn't, British troops could face war crimes charges at the International Criminal Court, argues Kenneth Roth. Tony Blair's decision to cast his lot with Washington in the looming war with Iraq isn't the only controversial part of British-American relations today. The Blair government has also been busy making concessions on the new International Criminal Court (ICC), which ideologues in the Bush administration are trying sedulously to subvert. Rather than trying to appease Washington, Blair should be pressing Bush to support key human rights principles. If America and Britain were to go to war against Iraq, it would be the first British military action to be subject to ICC scrutiny. Having taken legal effect on July 1, this permanent tribunal for genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity can exercise jurisdiction if such crimes are committed by a national or on a territory of a government that has ratified the court's treaty. (The UN Security Council can also refer cases.) Neither the United States nor Iraq is among the 81 governments that have ratified that treaty so far, but Britain and the entire European Union are. The ICC thus could prosecute British forces for war crimes committed in Iraq, even though American forces would be exempt. The ICC would act only if British authorities were unwilling or unable to seek justice, but even this limited oversight is significant. The Pentagon detests the ICC and wants to deny it any operational impact. But that is no longer an option for Britain. The criminal liability of its troops is now on the line. The British government has every right to insist that in any joint venture, the Pentagon be attentive to conduct that could result in war-crimes charges. Because no one expects British generals to lead a possible war in Iraq, the doctrine of command responsibility is unlikely to implicate British officers even if US forces are accused of war crimes. But if the conduct at issue is a foreseeable part of US policy that Britain helps to implement, British troops could be accused of aiding and abetting war crimes or participating in a joint criminal enterprise. The lack of ICC jurisdiction over American partners in that enterprise would not preclude the court from pursuing Britons. In recent wars, US forces have made mistakes and even violated international humanitarian law but have not committed war crimes. Still, it is possible that, should war erupt in Iraq, American and British forces might fall foul of, for example, the provision of the ICC treaty outlawing attacks on military targets that cause """"clearly excessive"""" harm to civilians. That is especially so if they do not learn lessons from recent wars and take corrective steps. The weapon most likely to produce such harm is the cluster bomb. A typical cluster bomb is a container that opens in mid-air and scatters up to 200 bomblets over an area the size of half a soccer field. Even in their new, """"wind-corrected"""" form, cluster bombs are not precision weapons. If used where civilians are present, the size of the area they attack and the difficulty of directing them reliably mean that civilian casualties - sometimes substantial casualties - are foreseeable. A court conceivably could find that the use of cluster bombs in such circumstances is a war crime. Compounding the problem is that many bomblets fall to the ground without immediately exploding. In Afghanistan, the number was as high as 20 percent, according to de-miners. These unexploded bomblets function as highly volatile anti-personnel landmines. They can kill and maim civilians long after the fighting has ended. That increases the chances that a court would find the civilian harm caused by cluster bombs to be clearly excessive. Both Britain and the United States have cluster bombs. To avoid potential ICC prosecution of Britons, Tony Blair should insist that neither British nor American troops use cluster bombs in Iraq, or at least nowhere near civilians. Undoubtedly, the Pentagon will kick and scream at this invocation of the ICC. But the price of British participation in a possible war should be, at the very least, American attention to British concerns about avoiding criminal liability. A second challenge facing the Blair government is Washington's latest effort to exempt Americans from the ICC. Washington is worried because American soldiers would be subject to the court's jurisdiction should they commit a war crime or other atrocity on the territory of a government that has ratified the treaty. That is not a problem in the case of Iraq, but it could be a problem elsewhere. US diplomats have been circling the globe to insist that governments send any American suspect home instead of to the court. Most EU members want to reject Washington's demand, but the Blair government would accept it. The legitimacy of the court depends on a common EU policy of rejection. The ICC treaty reflects a preference for national over international prosecutions. The court is empowered to pursue a case only if the relevant national government is unable or unwilling to proceed. If more than one government wants to launch a prosecution, Article 98 of the ICC treaty allows governments to decide which has priority. Washington cites Article 98 to justify its latest demand. However, governments that ratify the ICC treaty are obliged to ensure that people accused of war crimes or other atrocities are brought to justice. A government can fulfil that obligation either by sending the suspect to the ICC or by pursuing the case itself, subject to ICC oversight to ensure that justice is done. It doesn't meet this obligation to send a suspect to a government that doesn't recognise ICC oversight. Some European governments have tried to address this problem by seeking a pledge from Washington to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute any ICC suspect sent its way. But that isn't good enough, because the US government rejects ICC oversight. In the case of war crimes and other atrocities, the entire point of the ICC was never to trust unverified national pledges to bring suspects to justice. That is what allowed Augusto Pinochet, Idi Amin and Pol Pot to avoid a proper trial. Without an ICC scrutinising those pledges, there is nothing to prevent the use of political influence, or even intimidation and violence, to compromise national efforts to prosecute. No ICC member thus should ever send an ICC suspect to a government that hasn't ratified the ICC treaty, unless that government consents to ICC oversight of its investigative and prosecutorial efforts. Anything less violates the spirit if not the letter of the ICC treaty. Washington will vehemently resist giving such consent. But Washington also once resisted pledging not to seek the death penalty for suspects surrendered by European governments. Today, these pledges have become routine. If Europe can force Washington to accept its anti-death-penalty principles, it should be able to force Washington to live with its anti-war-crimes principles. The dispute about agreements under Article 98 isn't just about the fate of a hypothetical American suspect. It is about the legitimacy of the ICC. As Washington knows, a court that exempts the superpower, whether explicitly or not, undermines its legitimacy. This is part of the Bush administration's strategy for killing the court. Countering this cynical strategy requires the Blair government and its European allies to insist that justice apply even to the superpower. The Blair government is not eager to confront Washington on the ICC when it is trying to restrain the Bush administration's unilateralist instincts on Iraq. Fair enough. But there is no urgent need for an agreement under Article 98. Practically, the ICC won't be in a position to seek the surrender of suspects until 2004. Better to defer the issue to a less fraught moment than to capitulate on a principle that will harm the legitimacy of this historic institution. Tony Blair is also eager not to fuel Washington's animosity toward the court. But it is a little late. To preclude the prosecution ofUS citizens, in the last few months the Bush administration has threatened to close down UN peacekeeping, cut off military aid to court supporters, and even use military force to liberate any American held by the court. To give in now on this matter of principle will not placate Washington. It will reward Washington's worst ambitions for the court's demise, and encourage more of the same. The creation of the ICC is the most important institutional development for human rights in over 50 years. Tony Blair may have a special relationship with George W. Bush, but no friend should indulge the Bush administration's unilateralist instincts at the expense of a court that stands to benefit us all, including the United States.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

Burma has claimed a recent Human Rights Watch report is """"just another example of attempts to tarnish the image of Myanmar and the Myanmar Tatmadaw (military) in the eyes of the international community."""" """"We're very disappointed that, despite ample evidence to the contrary, the government continues to deny the military's use of children as soldiers,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"It is the widespread forced recruitment of children by Burma's army that tarnishes the image of the country, not efforts to bring these abuses to light."""" On October 16, Human Rights Watch released a report based on numerous first-hand testimonies of children who had been forcibly recruited by Burma's military. The report found that boys as young as 11 are forced into the army, brutally treated, and forced to commit human rights abuses and fight against armed opposition groups. Although the vast majority of Burma's child soldiers are in government armed forces, armed opposition groups were found to include children as well.  The government claimed on Thursday that the military is purely voluntary and that national laws setting the enlistment age at 18 are """"strictly enforced.""""  """"Burma's denial of the use of child soldiers is not credible,"""" said Becker. """"We urge the government to take positive steps to confront the problem.

The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights Situation in Myanmar, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, is currently in Burma for his fourth visit to the country.

The overwhelming majority of Burma's child soldiers are found in the national army, which forcibly recruits children as young as 11, although armed opposition groups use child soldiers as well. """"Burma has a poor human rights record, but its record on child soldiers is the worst in the world,"""" said Jo Becker, advocacy director of the Children's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch. Burma's army has doubled in size since 1988, and with an estimated 350,000 soldiers is now one of the largest armies in Southeast Asia. According to the accounts of former soldiers interviewed by Human Rights Watch, 20 percent or more of its active duty soldiers may be children under the age of 18.  The 220-page report, """"My Gun was as Tall as Me: Child Soldiers in Burma,"""" is the most comprehensive study of child soldiers in Burma to date. Drawing on interviews with more than three dozen current and former child soldiers, the report examines child recruitment by 19 different armed opposition groups in addition to Burma's national army.  Recruiters for Burma's army frequently apprehend boys at train and bus stations, markets and other public places, threatening them with jail if they refuse to join the army. The boys are given no opportunity to contact their families, and are sent to camps where they undergo weapons training, are routinely beaten, and brutally punished if they try to escape. Human Rights Watch received several accounts of boys who were beaten to death after trying to run away.  Once deployed, boys as young as 12 engage in combat against opposition groups, and are forced to commit human rights abuses against civilians, including rounding up villagers for forced labor, burning villages, and carrying out executions. Human Rights Watch interviewed two boys, ages 13 and 15 at the time, who belonged to units that massacred a group of 15 women and children in Shan State in early 2001.  """"Burma's army preys on children, using threats, intimidation and often violence to force young boys to become soldiers,"""" said Becker. """"To be a boy in Burma today means facing the constant risk of being picked up off the street, forced to commit atrocities against villagers, and never seeing your family again.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that there is no way to precisely estimate the number of children in Burma's army, but it appears that the vast majority of new recruits are forcibly conscripted, and there may be as many as 70,000 soldiers under the age of 18.  Children are also present in Burma's myriad armed opposition groups, although child recruitment is generally decreasing as many opposition groups have shrunk in size and resources in recent years. The United Wa State Army, the largest of the opposition forces, forcibly conscripts children and has the largest number of child soldiers of the opposition groups. The Kachin Independence Army also forcibly recruits children, and according to witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch, is the only armed group in Burma to recruit girls. Other opposition forces, including the Shan State Army (South), Karen National Liberation Army and the Karenni Army, have stated policies against recruiting children under the age of 18, but appear to accept children who actively seek to join their forces. Although many armed opposition groups have ceasefire agreements with the government, children in opposition forces may also participate in combat, sometimes with little training.  """"The international community has increasingly recognized the use of child soldiers as unacceptable,"""" said Becker. """"Burma's armed forces and groups must immediately stop recruiting children, and demobilize all children in their ranks.""""  International law prohibits government forces or armed groups from recruiting children under the age of fifteen. Such recruitment has been recognized as a war crime under the statute for the International Criminal Court. In 2000, the United Nations General Assembly adopted an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child that raised the minimum age for participation in armed conflict to 18, and prohibits all forced recruitment of children below age 18. Burma is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, but has not yet signed and ratified the optional protocol.  The International Labour Organization convention on the worst forms of child labor, adopted in 1999, also recognizes the forced recruitment of children under age 18 for use in armed conflict as one of the worst forms of child labor.  Human Rights Watch called on Burma's army and all armed opposition groups to immediately end all recruitment of children under the age of 18, and to demobilize all children currently serving as soldiers. It urged the government and armed groups to cooperate with international agencies such as UNICEF to reunify former child soldiers with their families and facilitate their rehabilitation and social reintegration.  Human Rights Watch also appealed to other governments to strongly condemn the recruitment and use of child soldiers by the Burma government and other armed groups, and to use diplomatic and other appropriate means to end the use of child soldiers in Burma.  Around the world, an estimated 300,000 children under the age of 18 are currently participating in armed conflicts in approximately 30 countries.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/10/16/children-war","Children at War","Children at War","","10/16/2002","In late 1999, a pair of chain-smoking twin boys called Luther and Johnny Htoo captured headlines as the leaders of the God's Army, an armed opposition group in Burma. Media stories about the boys and their reported mystical powers reinforced a common notion that use of child soldiers is largely a rebel group phenomenon. Yet by far the largest user of child soldiers in Burma is the military government, which appears to have 10 times as many child soldiers in its army as all of Burma's opposition groups combined. While conducting research along the border between Thailand and Burma this year, I interviewed Aung, who was forced into into the Burmese government army at age 11. He was sent into combat for the first time when he was 12. """"I was too afraid to look,"""" he said, """"so I put my face in the ground and shot my gun up at the sky. I was afraid that if I didn't fire the section leader would punish me."""" By the time he was 14 he had been in more than 20 battles and fighting had become routine. Last year, at age 13, Aung said he saw members of his unit massacre 15 Shan minority women and children. He told me that after blindfolding and machine-gunning the women, soldiers killed three babies by swinging them by their legs against rocks. Other former child soldiers have been forced to carry out appalling acts against civilians, including burning homes and rounding up villagers, including children, for forced labor. To be a boy in Burma today is to face the constant risk of being picked up off the street and forced to become a soldier, and never seeing your parents again. Former child soldiers interviewed by Human Rights Watch described being threatened with jail if they refused to join the government army, enduring repeated beatings during training, and risking brutal punishment if they tried to escape. Once deployed, they are often sent into combat against opposition armies with little idea of why they are fighting. Child recruitment in Burma has increased in recent years as the government has expanded its armed forces. Since violently crushing pro-democracy demonstrations in 1988, it has doubled the size of the army to an estimated 350,000 soldiers. Recruiters, offered financial incentives for producing new recruits, find that children are the most easily coerced or intimidated into joining. Accounts from former soldiers indicate that 20 percent or more of the army's active duty soldiers may be under the age of 18, suggesting a staggering 70,000 children under arms. The practice of recruiting children to fight extends to the rebels fighting the government. The God's Army no longer exists, but more than 30 opposition groups still operate inside Burma. All but the smallest appear to have children in their ranks. Burma's largest opposition army, the United Wa State Army, compels Wa families with more than one son to provide one for military training. The Democratic Karen Buddhist Army and Kachin Independence Army are also known to forcibly recruit children. Other groups have policies against the recruitment of children, but accept those below 18 who have been displaced by fighting or who seek revenge against Burmese forces for abuses committed against their families or communities. Child recruitment among opposition groups is generally declining. Some groups have reached cease-fire agreements with the government, while those still fighting have lost strength and resources. Several opposition groups, including the Karen National Liberation Army and the Karenni Army, acknowledge the presence of child soldiers in their forces and express interest in complying with international standards prohibiting the recruitment and use of under-age soldiers. In contrast, the government has flatly denied any recruitment of children and recently reported to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child that in Burma """"there are no children in armed conflict."""" International pressure for reform in Burma has often focused on release of political prisoners, easing restrictions on the National League for Democracy and its leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and ending forced labor. Pressure toward these goals should continue. But in addition the international community should demand an immediate end to child recruitment, and demobilization of children in all Burma's armed forces and groups as a condition for any lifting of sanctions or renewed financial investment in Burma.

On October 8, Human Rights Watch wrote to President Lagos congratulating him on the bill's presentation before Congress, while urging him to give it urgent attention.

In the letter, Vivanco noted that earlier freedom expression reforms had been held up for years in Congress before their enactment last year.  The reform bill would amend several articles of the criminal code and the code of military justice that penalize strongly-worded criticism of government authorities, including the president, members of Congress, senior judges, and members of the armed forces. It would repeal article 263 of the criminal code, under which television panelist Eduardo Yáñez was arrested and prosecuted in January for criticisms of the judiciary expressed in a television debate about miscarriages of justice.  In April 2001, the Lagos government repealed a provision of the State Security Law that barred criticism of public authorities. Using that provision, more than thirty journalists and politicians had been prosecuted for criticizing military leaders, congressmen, and judges since Chile reinstated democratic rule in 1990.  Last year's reforms, however, failed to repeal all of the insult provisions of Chilean law, which are classified as offenses against public order and security.","Americas, Chile","Press Freedom, Free Speech"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/10/11/hong-kong-liberties-doubt","Hong Kong- Liberties in Doubt","Hong Kong: Liberties in Doubt","","10/11/2002","HONG KONG: The recent cave-in by Hong Kong to pressure from Beijing to enact laws against subversion, sedition, secession and theft of state secrets was hardly a surprise. Hong Kong and Chinese government officials have been threatening to do this since Hong Kong's 1997 handover from Britain to China. But the muted response from key governments was surprising and disappointing.  Maybe it was the timing. President George W. Bush is preparing to host President Jiang Zemin at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, on Oct. 25. With Iraq and many other issues on the agenda, the White House may be wary of stirring up a debate with Beijing over U.S. interference in the """"internal affairs"""" of Hong Kong, which is, after all, a part of China. Or perhaps the Bush administration wants to avoid having to defend to China its own restrictions on civil liberties in the U.S. war against terrorism.  Britain has thus far refrained from any detailed public comments; nor has the European Union been outspoken. Asian leaders, including the Chinese prime minister, were in Copenhagen for an Asia-Europe Meeting when Hong Kong's secretary for security, Regina Ip, announced the government's """"consultation"""" document on Sept. 24. The U.S. State Department issued a cautious statement, welcoming the three-month public consultation period before new laws are adopted, and expressing hope that the legislation would be """"consistent with international human rights standards"""" and the United Nations human rights treaty to which Hong Kong is a party.   The U.S. State Department issued a cautious statement, welcoming the three-month public consultation period before new laws are adopted, and expressing hope that the legislation would be """"consistent with international human rights standards"""" and the United Nations human rights treaty to which Hong Kong is a party. By contrast, civil rights advocates and members of Hong Kong's Legislative Council have been vigorous in criticism of the proposal unveiled by Ip. The Hong Kong government claims that laws to apply the legislation will be """"clearly and tightly defined"""" so that fundamental rights and freedoms are protected. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa went out of his way to say the new laws """"would not undermine in any way the existing human rights and civil liberties enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong,"""" which since 1997 has been styled a special administrative region of China. But many have objected to key provisions in the consultation document, including proposals to give the police broad new search powers, prohibit groups in Hong Kong from giving support to organizations proscribed under Chinese law for """"endangering state security,"""" and criminalize as state secrets (with a five-year prison term) exposure of information on relations between China and Hong Kong. The document defines treason or attempts to overthrow mainland China's system of government not only in terms of acts of violence but also of """"other serious unlawful means,"""" leaving open major potential loopholes. The proposed law would reach Hong Kong permanent residents abroad. So, hypothetically, the Hong Kong government could prosecute someone in Hong Kong for bringing funds to support pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing, as happened during the protests in 1989. It would also reach foreigners for their acts while in Hong Kong. Some safeguards are built in, such as review by the Hong Kong courts of decisions to declare foreign political organizations illegal because they are """"harmful to national security or unity."""" But, given Beijing's demonstrated willingness to interfere with Hong Kong's judicial system, how effective would such safeguards be? The U.S. State Department's most recent report under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act noted concern about the authority of the Court of Final Appeal being undermined by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in Beijing when it chooses to """"reinterpret"""" certain sensitive court decisions. Is there any doubt that Beijing would intervene again (as it is allowed to do under the Basic Law) if it felt that Hong Kong's courts were not vigorously applying the new laws on subversion and secession? China is entering a transition period. The new leadership after the Communist Party Congress in November will have to deal with widening rural and worker unrest and restive ethnic minority populations. China's leaders are anxious to see new laws imposed in Hong Kong that would protect mainland China from perceived threats of subversion - whether from Falun Gong or supporters of the banned China Democracy Party - and would further increase the Hong Kong government's almost total executive control. Autonomy under the """"one country, two systems"""" formula must be strongly defended. The United States, the EU, Canada, Japan, Australia and others should speak up, privately and publicly, to support full protection of Hong Kong's civil and political rights.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/10/10/letter-nigerian-president-obasanjo-regarding-bakassi-boys","Letter to Nigerian President Obasanjo Regarding the Bakassi Boys","Letter to Nigerian President Obasanjo Regarding the Bakassi Boys","","10/10/2002","Dear President Obasanjo,   I am writing to welcome your government's initiative to put an end to the serious human rights abuses committed by the vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys, active primarily in Abia and Anambra states. As you may know, Human Rights Watch has carried out detailed research on abuses by the Bakassi Boys, the findings of which are contained in our May 2002 report The Bakassi Boys: the Legimitization of Murder and Torture, published jointly with the Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN). The Bakassi Boys have not only been responsible for serious abuses, often with the support of state governments, but they have been able to commit repeated criminal acts with impunity and remained unaccountable. Since publishing this report, we have continued to monitor the human rights situation in the area. We were therefore interested to learn about the police operations which took place in several locations, first in Abia State in August 2002, then in Anambra State in late September, resulting in the arrests of scores of Bakassi Boys and the release of people detained unlawfully by the Bakassi Boys, many of whom had been subjected to horrific torture and mutilation.   We would be grateful for any further information from your government on the results of these operations, in particular the number of detainees released from each location, the number of Bakassi Boys who have been arrested, their identity, details of the charges they are facing, and when their trials can be expected to start.   While we regret that the federal government and police did not take action earlier, which could have saved hundreds of people from torture or killings at the hands of the Bakassi Boys, nevertheless we commend the decision to intervene at this time. However, critical to the success of this initiative will be the immediate implementation of a number of measures to prevent such a situation from occurring again. We therefore urge you to implement the following recommendations as soon as possible to ensure that the grave abuses carried out by the Bakassi Boys are not repeated and that the breakdown of law and order which gave rise to their creation does not return. These steps are all the more important in view of reactions from some sectors of the local population in Abia and Anambra states, including some state government officials, who have expressed displeasure with the police crackdown against the Bakassi Boys and called for their reinstatement.   The recommendations below supplement those contained in our report published in May 2002.  Where sufficient evidence exists, bring specific criminal charges against the members of the Bakassi Boys who have been arrested, and ensure that they are brought to trial promptly and fairly, with guarantees of due process. Give clear instructions to police or other officials responsible for their custody that they should not be subjected to torture, ill-treatment or extrajudicial execution, and should always be held in official prisons or recognized places of detention. The fact that many of those detained may themselves have carried out acts of torture or killing and detained people unlawfully can never be used to justify subjecting them to similar treatment.  Ensure that the police investigate not only the role of rank-and-file members of the Bakassi Boys, but also the role of the individuals who ordered them to carry out serious human rights abuses, and take appropriate judicial action against them. While any individual who has participated in acts of murder and torture should be prosecuted, legal responsibility also falls upon those who masterminded the violence.  Resist any pressure from state government officials or other individuals to release members of the Bakassi Boys against whom there is evidence of participation in human rights abuses, as has happened in some cases in the past. Most recently, Human Rights Watch has received reports that agents of the Anambra State government may have been exerting pressure on authorities in Abuja to release those arrested by the police in September.  Investigate all previous cases of human rights abuses by the Bakassi Boys and ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice. These should include the many cases of arbitrary detention, torture and extrajudicial killings documented by Human Rights Watch and CLEEN in our May 2002 report, as well as others. In almost all these cases, the perpetrators have continued to benefit from complete impunity.  Make public all aspects of the legal proceedings in the cases involving the Bakassi Boys and their sponsors. This would help demonstrate the government's commitment to respecting due process and the rule of law in these cases - part of a longer-term goal to educate the population on the importance of respecting the law, even, and especially, in the case of individuals who have shown blatant disregard for the law themselves.  Provide compensation to the men and women who were unlawfully detained by the Bakassi Boys and ensure they receive appropriate medical treatment for injuries sustained as a result of torture. Ensure that they are protected from reprisals by sympathizers of the Bakassi Boys, or by those who may have organised their arrest in the first place.  Take effective and long-lasting measures to ensure that the Bakassi Boys are not re-constituted or replaced by a similar organization in Anambra, Abia or other states. Such measures should concentrate on reform of the police force, whose apparent inability to control crime and protect the population was the main cause of the emergence of the Bakassi Boys in the first place. We refer you to our recommendations on police reform contained in our May 2002 report on the Bakassi Boys, particularly with regard to providing the police with an adequate number of personnel, better training and working conditions, and eradicating human rights abuse and corruption within the police. Human Rights Watch believes that such reforms should be the priority of the Nigerian government in order to prevent the resurgence of the Bakassi Boys or other similarly unaccountable groups. We believe that a blanket ban or prohibition of the Bakassi Boys is unlikely to be effective unless additional steps are taken to restore law and order in a manner which satisfies the population that their security is being taken seriously by the authorities and by the official law enforcement agencies - primarily the police.  Initiate a process for repealing existing state laws that endorse the activities of the Bakassi Boys, such as the law which was passed to establish the group under the name Anambra Vigilante Services, in Anambra State, in 2000.  Ensure that any group or individual exercising government-endorsed law enforcement powers is held legally accountable for their actions and observes international standards for law enforcement at all times, including the UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials.   We would be grateful for any further information from your government on any other measures to prevent further human rights abuses by vigilante groups in Nigeria.

Human Rights Watch has documented grave human rights abuses committed by the Bakassi Boys in the southeastern Nigerian states of Abia and Anambra.   In a letter sent to Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, Human Rights Watch welcomed the government's action, but deplored the federal government's failure to act earlier. Human Rights Watch urged the president to implement longer-lasting reforms of the police to ensure that law and order are restored, with respect for human rights, and the population no longer resorts to vigilantism for security.   """"If the federal government and police had taken action earlier, they could have saved hundreds of people from torture or killings at the hands of the Bakassi Boys,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.

Human Rights Watch, together with the Lagos-based Centre for Law Enforcement Education (CLEEN), published a detailed report in May 2002 documenting a range of serious human rights abuses by the Bakassi Boys, including a pattern of extrajudicial killings, torture and unlawful detention.

Tomorrow, the EU is expected to release the latest annual reports assessing the progress of individual candidates toward accession. These will help pave the way for final decisions, expected later this year, on the next round of EU enlargement. Several candidate countries in Central and Eastern Europe have a track record of supplying arms to human rights abusers, areas of violent conflict, and clients suspected of diverting weapons to unauthorized destinations, and such practices have continued. “In the past year, some EU candidate countries have made strides in improving controls on the arms trade,” said Lisa Misol, researcher with the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. “But the European Union must remain engaged, even after enlargement decisions are made, to help secure improvements and address remaining problems.” In a new briefing paper released today, Human Rights Watch said that the prospect of EU enlargement had helped motivate the tightening of arms trade controls by Central and Eastern European countries. Human Rights Watch stressed, however, that more work was needed to ensure reliable control over the trade and adherence to basic norms governing arms exports. Drawing on recent examples from Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania and Slovakia, Human Rights Watch highlighted the following concerns: Authorized arms transfers to destinations where the weapons risk fueling human rights abuses and armed conflict, The absence of sufficient checks to prevent the diversion of weapons to unauthorized destinations, The activities of arms brokers and transport agents who disguise the true destination of the weapons, The need to strictly enforce arms embargoes and punish violators, and The sale of surplus weapons from government arsenals to trouble spots around the globe. Human Rights Watch offered recommendations for how EU countries could help ensure strict controls on the arms trade from Central and Eastern Europe. It also called on Western European countries to live up to minimum standards, as outlined in the 1998 EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, to which candidate countries have also adhered. Human Rights Watch said that, in addition to raising standards among candidate countries, EU member states should exercise the utmost caution in national arms trade decisions, in strict compliance with the EU Code of Conduct. “When it comes to stopping irresponsible arms trading from Europe, the European Union should lead the way by example,” said Misol.","Europe/Central Asia, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Poland, Romania, Slovak Republic","Arms"

At its December Copenhagen summit, the European Union is expected to decide whether to give Turkey a date for negotiations. Human Rights Watch offered its own assessment of Turkey's record in a backgrounder on the October 9 publication of the European Union Regular Report on Turkey's Progress Towards Accession. """"Hits and Misses on Turkey's EU Accession Targets"""" includes information about the impressive strides that Turkey made during 2002 and the principal tasks that remain.

""""Instead of the previous tiny grudging steps, we have seen two major strides and the promise of further improvements.""""  Sugden said the major strides include the abolition of the death penalty and the removal of constraints on minority language education and broadcasting.  Human Rights Watch also welcomed news Monday that the Justice Ministry had prepared a draft law to curb torture by permitting all detainees access to a lawyer from the first moments of detention. The 11th-hour initiative aimed to satisfy yet another EU condition before the EU report release.  Human Rights Watch cautioned, however, that Turkey still faces a number of human rights challenges, including restrictions on free expression, prison conditions and violations of the rights of internally displaced persons and refugees.  """"There are two areas in particular where Turkey must still act in order to demonstrate that it has broken with its history of human rights abuses: torture and freedom of expression,"""" said Sugden.

He was briefly detained this past July after he submitted a statement to a U.S. Congressional briefing and signed a joint petition with others calling for democratic reforms.

We are also deeply concerned about Dr. Nguyen Dan Que, a leading peaceful advocate of human rights and democratic reform. Dr. Que's home in Ho Chi Minh City was raided by state security officials on September 20, the house was ransacked and documents searched. He was asked to leave with the police to be interrogated, but refused when they could not produce a court order for his arrest. Ten security officials were subsequently stationed outside his home. We urge you to order an immediate investigation into these flagrantly illegal and unwarranted actions against Dr. Que, and to ensure that there are not further threats against him.

It is the first time that a senior officer has been found responsible for planning human rights violations committed during Guatemala’s 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996. “The struggle for accountability in Guatemala has scored an important victory,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “At long last, one of the officers who used terror as a tactic during Guatemala’s war has been brought to justice.”  A three-judge tribunal sentenced Col. Juan Valencia Osorio to 30 years for his role in planning the killing. The tribunal acquitted Valencia’s co-defendants Gen. Augusto Godoy Gaitلn and Col. Juan Guillermo Oliva Carrera. Human Rights Watch has not yet had the opportunity to review these rulings.  Mack, an anthropologist, had been studying the army’s mistreatment of displaced rural communities when she was attacked in front of her Guatemala City office on September 11, 1990. Stabbed 27 times, she bled to death in the street.  Police initially informed Mack’s relatives that she had died in a traffic accident. Later, they suppressed a 60-page report by their own investigators that concluded it had been a political killing and linked the military to the crime. Only after Helen Mack, Myrna’s sister, intervened did the case move forward.  Army sergeant Noel Beteta was convicted of the murder and sentenced to 25 years in 1993. At the time of Mack’s murder, Beteta served in the presidential security unit (Estado Mayor Presidencial), under the command of the three officers convicted today. The unit was responsible for numerous human rights violations during the war, according to a U.N.-sponsored truth commission report issued in 1999. Last year, three veterans of the unit were convicted in the 1998 assassination of Bishop Juan Gerardi, who was bludgeoned to death with a cement block two days after he released the Catholic Church's report on wartime abuses, titled """"Guatemala: Never Again.""""  Myrna Mack was only one of 200,000 people killed during the country’s 36-year internal conflict, which ended in 1996. Like Mack, the vast majority of these were civilians killed by state forces. Only a handful of these cases have been addressed by the Guatemalan justice system and with very mixed results. (For information on other cases currently being pursued, please see Guatemala Mission Findings)  The history of the Mack prosecution illustrates the daunting obstacles that Guatemalans face seeking accountability for human rights abuses. One is the use of threats and violence to intimidate justice officials, witnesses and lawyers. In the Mack case, one police investigator who initially gathered the incriminating evidence was murdered in 1991. Two other investigators and three witnesses also received threats and fled the country. In August 2002, Roberto Romero, a lawyer acting for the Myrna Mack Foundation, reported receiving death threats and having his Guatemala City home shot at.  Another obstacle is the refusal of the Guatemalan military to cooperate with civilian justice system. In the Mack case, the military refused to supply justice officials with requested documentation and actively obstructed the investigation by submitting false information and doctored documents.  A third obstacle is the ability of defense attorneys to engage in dilatory legal maneuvering. This problem is compounded by the routine failure of justice officials to abide by legally mandated deadlines in responding to legal pleadings. In the Mack case, the defense’s delaying tactics forced the prosecution to drag out 12 years.  “The fact that even one officer was convicted is a testament to the extraordinary courage and perseverance of Helen Mack,” said Vivanco. “Yet if the many thousands of other victims are going to obtain justice, Guatemala will have to work much harder to remove the terrible obstacles she was forced to overcome.”","Americas, Guatemala",""

In addition to California, seven other jurisdictions-Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia-have laws that expressly protect youth from harassment or discrimination in public schools based on sexual orientation. Of those, Minnesota, New Jersey and the District of Columbia also prohibit discrimination based on gender identity.

The commission, established by Congress two years ago when the United States gave China Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) status, issued its report at a Capitol Hill press conference convened by the two co-chairs, Sen. Max Baucus (Montana) and Rep. Doug Bereuter (Nebraska).  """"The commission put its finger on some key issues,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"But it hasn't been effective this past year exerting pressure on China. And this report doesn't propose the kind of strategic actions needed to make an impact on China's serious human rights problems.""""  Human Rights Watch welcomed the commission's criticism of arbitrary arrests, torture, violation of worker rights and the lack of an independent judiciary. Human Rights Watch also welcomed the suggestions for the summit meeting between U.S. President George W. Bush and Chinese President Jiang Zemin on October 25 in Crawford, Texas, contained in a letter to Bush accompanying the report. But they didn't go far enough.  Although the commission noted China's attempts to use the war on terrorism to justify broad repression of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang, its letter to President Bush did not urge him to highlight this issue in Crawford, privately and publicly. Nor did it suggest that Bush use the summit to schedule a trip to China by the U.S. labor secretary to deal with worker rights violations.  Instead, the commission asked the president to raise cases of individual political prisoners, to call on China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and to invite U.N. human rights experts to visit China.  The commission is a bipartisan group composed of 19 members of Congress and representatives of the U.S. State, Labor and Commerce Departments. When it was created, the commission was widely seen as a substitute for the annual trade debate on China, which ended when PNTR was granted, to keep the focus on human rights concerns. But thus far, it has failed to have any significant impact on China policy. The group has made no effort to send international trial observers to China, to post one of its research staff in the U.S. embassy in Beijing, or to propose legislation on a code of conduct for American companies operating in China -- including Internet companies.  """"If Congress decides to fund the commission next year, it should attach requirements for specific actions, such as sending delegations to China to discuss its concerns with government officials and others,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.

In letters sent today to E.U. Foreign Ministers and U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Human Rights Watch expressed serious concern that although Croatia has cooperated with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) on some issues, it has failed to arrest and surrender Croatian nationals to the court. The tribunal has indicted three Croatian army generals for war crimes committed against Croatian Serbs during the 1991-95 war. One of the three indictees surrendered to the Hague court in 2001, but two of the three accused are still at liberty.  “The real test of Croatia’s commitment to international justice comes with these hard cases, involving its own wartime military leadership,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “At the moment, it looks like they are failing that test.”  On August 23, 2002, the tribunal prosecutor indicted retired General Janko Bobetko for war crimes committed against Croatian Serbs in 1993 in the area known as the Medak pocket. Also at large is General Ante Gotovina, indicted in 2001 for crimes committed in August 1995. The third indictee, General Rahim Ademi, surrendered to the ICTY in July 2001. In February 2002, the tribunal approved his provisional release pending trial.  Croatian government officials have refused to surrender Bobetko, arguing that he was only doing his constitutional duty to protect Croatia’s territorial integrity. The Human Rights Watch letters emphasize that the transfer of Generals Bobetko and Gotovina is firmly mandated by international law, as part of Croatia’s overall obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal. The rights group also pointed out that Croatia’s constitution cannot shield Bobetko from accountability for the specific crimes alleged in the indictment. Human Rights Watch warned that other governments in the region may use Croatia’s refusal to live up to its obligations to excuse their own obstruction of the tribunal’s work. To prevent such obstruction, Human Rights Watch urged the European Union and the United States to insist that Croatia fulfill its obligations or face repercussions for its bilateral relations.","Europe/Central Asia, Croatia","International Justice"

However, Human Rights Watch predicted that today's EU General Affairs Council (GAC) decision was not the last word and said national parliaments would have to step up to defend the ICC.     """"The European Union knew that the stakes were high for the credibility of the International Criminal Court and for the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy as a whole,"""" said Lotte Leicht, Europe director for Human Rights Watch. """"Yet the European Union failed to adopt a firm, unequivocal position in response to Washington's campaign to undermine the court.""""     At a Monday meeting of European Union foreign ministers, a set of vague benchmarks guiding bilateral agreements that any EU Member State signs with the U.S. government was adopted. The GAC claims the principles will """"preserve the integrity of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court."""" Human Rights Watch said that, to the contrary, the GAC """"guiding principles"""" adopted today do not ensure respect for the obligations of States Parties under the Statute.     """"The European Union asked the rest of the world to wait while they set 'high threshold benchmarks,'"""" said Leicht. """"But as adopted, these so-called benchmarks are so vague that they make a mockery of the European Union's common position on the ICC. In the process, the European Union has now also violated its own legally binding common position.""""     Since May the Bush administration has demanded that states sign bilateral agreements to immunize all U.S. citizens from investigation and prosecution by the ICC. In recent consultations with the European Union, the United States demanded total immunity for all American citizens and U.S.-connected personnel. Some governments have publicly stated their intention not to enter such agreements, which they believe contradict the purpose of the ICC. The ICC Treaty requires every State Party to surrender individuals sought by the court and expressly excludes any reservations.       """"Now we expect national parliaments in EU countries to carefully scrutinize any agreement their respective governments may negotiate with the United States,"""" Leicht said.     The European Union's adopted """"guiding principles"""" fail to acknowledge the ICC's oversight role where national systems are unwilling to investigate or prosecute. Additionally, while containing a reference to """"No Impunity,"""" there is no provision elaborating a legally binding commitment by the United States to hold citizens sought by the ICC to account under U.S. law.     """"Without an express guarantee of ICC oversight of national prosecutions, agreements with the United States would permit impunity,"""" said Leicht. """"They would allow the surrender of an ICC suspect to national authorities on the basis of a promise to investigate and prosecute that the ICC would be unable to review. The whole point of the ICC is never to rely on unverified national pledges to bring offenders to justice.""""     The principles cite the existence of """"state and diplomatic immunity under international law,"""" which could temporarily insulate sitting officials from prosecution where they are protected by such diplomatic immunity. At the same time, tracking the treaty's Article 98(2), the GAC principles limit the scope of persons who could be exempted to those actually """"sent"""" to the territory of the ICC State Party by the United States. This would include only personnel sent to an ICC State Party. The principles contain a """"sunset clause"""" that must be read to limit the duration of any agreement signed. The GAC principles also address ratification of any agreements signed and provide an important role for national parliaments to oversee negotiations.     The U.S. government is thoroughly opposed to the ICC. In May it announced an unprecedented diplomatic step - withdrawal of signature. In June and July U.S. officials battled for a Security Council Resolution to exempt any individuals participating in a U.N. peacekeeping operation from the authority of the court.     """"Weak bilateral agreements with Washington could open the door to impunity for those accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide,"""" Leicht said.

This new milestone in the march toward a tribunal for the world's worst human rights criminals was a moment of celebration. But the festivities were marred by the latest assault of the United States on the court. The dispute is part of Washington's long-standing efforts to exempt U.S. citizens from the reach of the ICC. Nominally it concerns how to interpret Article 98 of the Rome treaty establishing the court, but in fact the court's legitimacy is at stake. Article 98 recognizes agreements among ICC member states to resolve competing claims to prosecute a suspect. For example, if government A sends a soldier to country B where he commits a war crime, both governments A and B would have a legitimate interest in prosecution. Article 98 permits them to enter into an agreement ordering their claims - to decide which prosecution would take priority. The Rome treaty requires the ICC to defer to the resulting national court process, assuming that it is conducted in good faith. But if agreements under Article 98 are to remain true to the purpose of the Rome treaty, they must respect the ICC's right to intervene in national prosecutions should they prove to be a charade. No ICC suspect should ever be sent under Article 98 to a government that does not recognize this right. The Bush administration rejects any ICC oversight, but it still seeks agreements with governments to send any American suspect to the United States rather than to the ICC. That effort to circumvent the Rome treaty should be rejected. Some European governments are suggesting that Washington's proposal would be acceptable if the Bush administration made a """"no impunity"""" pledge - that is, if it vowed to investigate and, if appropriate, prosecute any suspect sent its way. But that would be no more than a fig leaf to disguise this effort to undermine the ICC's oversight function. The entire point of the ICC was never to trust unverified national pledges to bring the worst hu- man rights criminals to justice. A regime of unverified national pledges is what ensured that Augusto Pinochet, Idi Amin and Pol Pot were never properly tried. Without an ICC scrutinizing those pledges, there is nothing to prevent the use of political influence, intimidation or violence to compromise national efforts to prosecute. Recognizing this fact would require Washington to accept ICC oversight whenever a government that has ratified the Rome treaty sends an ICC suspect to the United States. Today many governments refuse to extradite murder suspects to the United States unless Washington agrees to forsake the death penalty, a condition that America reluctantly but routinely accepts. Similarly, no ICC suspect should be sent to the United States unless Washington recognizes the jurisdiction of the ICC to intercede in that case in the event of a sham investigation or prosecution. At bottom, the dispute is not about the unlikely possibility that American soldiers will find themselves in the dock. It is about the legitimacy of the ICC. As the Bush administration is fully aware, a court that exempts the world's superpower risks losing its legitimacy. Indeed, that is the goal of certain extremists in Washington who seek to exercise America's unprecedented military power without the inconvenient constraints of international law, or at least international law enforced by anyone other than the United States itself. We stand today on the threshold of a new era in international law enforcement because so many nations of the world banded together in defense of principle. Similar collective action is needed to defeat new challenges to the scope and legitimacy of the ICC. Nations of the world have every right to insist on recognition of a basic principle: Whenever someone, even a soldier of the superpower, commits an atrocity on their territory, they are obligated to enlist the ICC to ensure prosecution. Without U.S. acceptance of that principle, the agreements Washington seeks under the guise of Article 98 should be rejected as impunity deals that are inconsistent with the purpose of the Rome treaty.","United States",""

The ban covers all relief flights and vehicles into southern Sudan from the main relief bases in Kenya and Uganda. “Barring relief access to more than one million civilians in southern Sudan will surely bring on a catastrophe,” said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Coming at the same time that the government is stepping up its bombing of civilian areas in southern Sudan, the relief ban heaps one abuse on another.”  The duration of the ban is not clear; one report says it is to last from September 27 until October 6, 2002, others say it is indefinite. The flight and vehicle ban has been placed on Eastern and Western Equatoria, the regions bordering Kenya and Uganda. There is no way to reach the rest of the war-affected areas of southern Sudan from there without flying hundreds of kilometers out of the way—which most relief planes cannot do because they lack the fuel storage capacity.  The government ban on relief flights comes during a period when increased abuses are reported in the civil war in southern Sudan between Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A).  Aid agencies in southern Sudan have reported that, in September 2002 alone, there has been government bombing affecting civilians in Mundri (11 killed, 10 wounded in a displaced persons camp) and Yei in Western Equatoria; Torit and Kapoeta in Eastern Equatoria; Wunrok (13-year-old boy killed, seven wounded) in Bahr El Ghazal; Atar (nine killed) in Upper Nile; Gar, Kawer and Tanger (Western Upper Nile); Lualdit, Kanawer, Ajajer, Padak and Matiang (three killed) and Lui (13 killed in a cattle camp, including four children), in Jonglei; Ganga in Abyei county (family of six killed). This list does not include all bombing incidents in the war in September, but clearly represents an escalation of aerial bombing.  There have been reports that in September the SPLA attacked villages south of Mayom (three killed) and used a landmine in Thar Jath (four or five killed) in Western Upper Nile, and that the SPLA shelled the town and summarily executed an unknown number of captured soldiers in Torit, Eastern Equatoria.  These abuses have taken place despite the agreement in March 2002 between Sudanese government and the SPLM/A (fostered by U.S. Special Envoy for Peace in Sudan former Senator John Danforth) in which each undertook not to target civilians or civilian objects in the war. In accordance with these agreements, the U.S. government has put in place a Civilian Protection Monitoring Team, based in Khartoum and the southern rebel-held town of Rumbek. The team is charged with investigating military attacks by both sides targeting civilians and other violations of the Geneva Conventions. Both the Sudanese government and the SPLA agreed to permit this team to travel freely in southern Sudan.  “Now is the time for the Civilian Protection Monitoring Team to investigate the continuing abuses by both sides as they wage this war in areas susceptible to famine,” said Rone. “At a minimum they should investigate the reports the staff on the ground have made that civilians were killed or injured in the fighting in September 2002, and the reported abuses by the SPLA in Torit in August-September 2002.”  The government of Sudan walked out of peace talks with the rebels on September 2 in Machakos, Kenya, in protest of the SPLA’s capture of Torit—although at the time there was no ceasefire agreement and the government was attacking and capturing SPLA locations as well. The government has vowed to retake Torit.  “The relief flight ban means that there will be no relief agencies in the south to witness and report on bombings and other attacks while the government is pursuing its offensive,” Rone said.  The United Nations and other agencies based in northern Kenya have some 600 relief personnel in southern Sudan on any one day, and conduct about 20 flights a day into the area. Evacuation of all staff members alone would pose enormous logistical problems under this ban.  The Sudanese government also continues to pursue its military campaign in the southern oilfields of Western Upper Nile, which has displaced hundreds of thousands of civilians since 1999. The food security situation in Western Upper Nile is “precarious,” because of these increasing government attacks on rebels and presumed civilian supporters in the oilfields. The Famine Early Warning System Networks (FEWS Net) estimates that thousands of people displaced by this fighting in 2002 have put recent pressure on host communities in neighboring Bahr El Ghazal and Jonglei areas, the hosts themselves will need assistance because of low grain production, caused by sporadic rainfall.  “This was the recipe for the famine of 1998: massive displacement of civilians by war into areas where food is projected to be scarce, plus a sudden government ban on humanitarian access to the disaster areas,” Rone said.","Africa, Sudan",""

Senators Phil Gramm of Texas and Zell Miller of Georgia offered the bill in response to an earlier version sponsored by Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. The Gramm-Miller bill fails to provide basic internal oversight and accountability mechanisms for abuses by officers of the powerful new agency. The Gramm-Miller bill also guts key protections for unaccompanied immigrant children, such as access to counsel and a legal guardian for every child in immigration custody. Although these provisions were contained in the Lieberman bill, they are not part of the Gramm-Miller version of the legislation.

The paper's release marks the one-year anniversary of Australia's controversial asylum legislation, passed on September 26, 2001. The Australian government has been on an aggressive mission to muster international support for its approach during the past 12 months. Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock has declared he will use next week's [September 30-October 4] meeting of the Executive Committee of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to again deliver the message that unauthorized """"secondary movements"""" of refugees from country to country should be prohibited.  """"The Australian government argues that asylum seekers could have found protection closer to home,"""" said Ophelia Field, author of the Human Rights Watch paper. """"We found that many were forced to travel because they were not safe where they were.""""  Human Rights Watch collected testimonies from dozens of asylum seekers and refugees from Afghanistan and Iraq describing why they attempted to seek refuge in Australia. The testimonies reveal many had legitimate, protection-related reasons for doing so. Some had been forcibly returned to the hands of persecutors on a previous attempt to find asylum in Pakistan or Iran. Therefore they had wanted to get further away when they fled for a second time. Others had experienced ongoing persecution by agents operating across borders. Many more were discriminated against so severely by the laws of their first host country that this treatment could itself amount to persecution within the meaning of the Refugee Convention.  Drawing on this research, Human Rights Watch concluded that Australia's laws violate the Refugee Convention by imposing penalties on those who travel via third countries, regardless of their individual circumstances.  The findings also illustrate the impracticality of Australia's suggestion that refugees should be obliged to wait in """"queues"""" for resettlement from their regions of origin. Some refugees said that they simply could not do so without putting themselves at further risk. Others had applied for resettlement in the first host country they reached, but were nonetheless forced to flee onwards.  Human Rights Watch said Australia's current refugee policies raise serious human rights concerns, including the use of interception and detention of asylum seekers at sea under """"inhumane and degrading"""" conditions. This sets a poor example for all coastal states, and is particularly dangerous at a time when Greece and Italy will hold the next two EU presidencies.  The Australian laws have downgraded the quality of protection granted to almost all refugees who pass through third countries prior to their arrival in Australia. Such refugees will be indefinitely denied family reunification and the freedom to leave and enter Australia. They may forever be denied a secure legal status, endlessly having to renew their """"Temporary Protection Visas,"""" even though they are recognized as refugees under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.  Human Rights Watch said the policy of returning asylum seekers to Indonesia or transferring them to other Pacific countries such as Nauru and Papua New Guinea shifts responsibility onto international organizations operating in those countries. These include UNHCR, but also the International Organization of Migration, which is not primarily concerned with refugee protection.  Earlier this month, the UNHCR told EU Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs that UNHCR supports the creation of a new international agreement concerning the issue of """"secondary movement."""" Human Rights Watch believes the UN proposal and other initiatives under development in the European Union must take care not to end up mirroring the Australian approach.

Human Rights Watch commended the Indian government for responding swiftly to maintain law and order in Gujarat state. The Indian government has deployed approximately 3,000 army personnel in Gujarat while the prime minister and other Indian officials have called on citizens of the state to end the cycle of violence and refrain from taking the law into their own hands. Since February 27, 2002, when a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra attacked a train carrying Hindu activists and left 58 people dead, close to 1,000 people, mostly Muslim, have been killed in Gujarat. Human Rights Watch's investigations, and those of other human rights groups, revealed that Gujarat state officials actively participated in the violence against Muslims. """"The government of Gujarat must prove that it can maintain peace and security in the state and not become complicit again in the killing of civilians,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Those responsible for the massacre in Gandhinagar must be brought to justice while all citizens, whatever their religion, must be protected from future attacks.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that potential for further outbreaks of violence in Gujarat and elsewhere in India remains high as a result of the call for a nationwide strike on Thursday by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council). A similar strike preceded the retaliatory attacks against Muslims in February. Human Rights Watch also called on the government to apprehend and prosecute those responsible for orchestrated attacks against Muslims.","Asia, India",""

The latest round of deportations began in April of this year.  Human Rights Watch called on the Cambodian government to continue granting first asylum to new arrivals from the Central Highlands of Vietnam and to cease the harassment and arrest of Cambodian villagers suspected of helping Montagnard refugees. """"Cambodia is in flagrant breach of its international obligations not to deport refugees to a place where they may face serious persecution,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The international community should insist that the Cambodian government provide asylum to any new refugees from Vietnam."""" Since the crumbling of a tripartite refugee repatriation agreement between the United Nations, Cambodia and Vietnam in April 2002, Cambodian authorities have deported more than 400 Montagnard asylum seekers back to Vietnam. Armed Cambodian militia have been dispatched to Cambodian villages bordering Vietnam's Central Highlands, where they have ordered Cambodian villagers not to help Montagnard refugees from Vietnam or face arrest. As many as 100 Montagnard asylum seekers from Vietnam are now reportedly hiding in the forests in the Vietnam-Cambodia border region, where they are in imminent danger of being arrested or forcibly deported to Vietnam. """"Rather than punishing people trying to help refugees, Cambodia should be protecting the Montagnards, especially since there's been no let-up in the harassment and persecution of them in the Central Highlands,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Human Rights Watch urged Cambodia's international donors to press Cambodia to fulfill its international obligations as a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Human Rights Watch also called on the Cambodian government to allow the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to re-establish its field presence in Cambodia's northeastern provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, which border Vietnam. Since March, Cambodia and Vietnam have increased the presence of police and military along both sides of the border, with Cambodia posting between five and seven armed militia members each in many villages in Ratanakiri province. Vietnamese officials and undercover police are reportedly freely crossing the border and questioning villagers, in search of Montagnard refugees. In addition, Vietnamese plainclothes police officers are reportedly collaborating with wildlife traders to conduct regular surveillance of Cambodian villages near the Vietnam border, particularly those with Christian populations suspected of helping asylum seekers from Vietnam. Cambodian police have threatened Cambodian villagers with arrest if they assist Montagnard refugees from Vietnam. Local officials have forced villagers in both Mondolkiri and Ratanakiri to thumbprint statements pledging not to help the refugees. Recent incidents of authorities threatening or arresting local villagers include the following: On May 16, Cambodian police arrested a fisherman in Mondolkiri province because of his alleged assistance to Montagnards seeking help from UNHCR. After three months in prison, charges of human trafficking were dropped and he was released on August 12. On July 5, Cambodian police arrested another man in Mondolkiri and detained him in prison on charges of hiding illegal immigrants. He was released on July 27, after charges were dropped. In August, Cambodian local officials and military police officers issued threats and warnings to indigenous Jarai villagers in O Yadao district of Ratanakiri, Cambodia. On August 7, an official in Pate Commune, O Yadao threatened to hold Christian leaders responsible for the disappearance of an indigenous family, who appear to have gone into hiding after the head of household was allegedly harassed by provincial authorities. In response to a written complaint about the harassment of Christian leaders in O Yadao, provincial officials intervened by sending a team out to investigate the threats. The flow of Montagnard refugees to Cambodia started in 2001, when more than 1,000 Montagnard refugees fled Vietnam after unrest in the Central Highlands in February 2001. A tripartite agreement between Vietnam, Cambodia and UNHCR that called for voluntary, UN-monitored repatriation of Montagnard refugees in Cambodia back to Vietnam, crumbled in March 2002, after Vietnamese officials barred UN monitoring teams from the Central Highlands. UNHCR's two provincial refugee camps were closed, and their 900 residents transported to Phnom Penh, where more than 700 of the refugees have being processed for resettlement in the United States. The Cambodian government maintains that its current policy is not to accept any new Montagnard refugees but to deport them. Since early March, no Montagnards have been able to safely cross the border to seek refuge in Cambodia, where UNHCR personnel have been prohibited from freely traveling to border areas in Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri.","Asia, Cambodia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

The rights organization called on Vietnam to cease arrests, harassment and arbitrary detentions of individuals based on their religious or political views. """"There's been no let-up in the persecution of the Montagnards,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"While the Vietnamese government has acknowledged that it has made some mistakes in dealing with the unrest in the Central Highlands, it needs to back words up with action and cease the serious human rights violations there."""" At least 30 Montagnards have been arrested in the Central Highlands since June. Targeted in the latest crackdown have been Protestant church leaders, land rights advocates, and individuals suspected of guiding asylum seekers to Cambodia. Dozens of Montagnards have gone into hiding, with current whereabouts unknown. The unrest in the Central Highlands began in early 2001, when thousands of indigenous highlanders, collectively known as Montagnards, conducted peaceful demonstrations calling for greater land rights and religious freedom. In the aftermath of the demonstrations, Vietnamese officials sent thousands of police and soldiers into the region, where they arrested dozens of Montagnards. Approximately 1,000 Montagnards fled to Cambodia to seek asylum. The latest crackdown in the Central Highlands began in June, when local authorities in Vietnam arrested at least 11 Montagnards. This was followed by a second round of at least 20 arrests in late August and September, when Vietnamese state media reported the possibility of renewed unrest and protests in the Central Highlands. The reasons for the arrests, the charges, and the place of detention of the majority of those arrested have not been made public. Since early August, between 10 and 30 police have been posted per village in many districts in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces, often in the homes of church leaders or suspected land rights activists. Telephone lines have been cut. Authorities continue to break up religious gatherings in the name of security, while pressuring Montagnards to sign loyalty oaths renouncing politics and religion. Montagnard Christian pastors and elders have been singled out for increased surveillance and warned not to travel unless they have advance written permission. Gatherings of villagers for worship, weddings and funerals continue to be largely forbidden by local authorities. """"We urge diplomats, journalists, and aid groups to make urgent inquiries about the arrests with government officials in Hanoi, who should open up access to the Central Highlands to U.N. monitors and independent observers,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Other recent incidents of repression of Montagnard Christians in Vietnam's Central Highlands include: In late April, district authorities in Krong Pac district, Dak Lak began summoning a minority church leader for interrogation, accusing him of violating the government's Decree on Religion. They ordered him to disband his church, and threatened him with arrest if he continued to hold church services in his home. Also in April, local authorities cut the electricity of several Ede Christian families in Ea Trol Commune, Phu Yen province, stating in a written order that they were implementing an order by the Party and the government to cut the electricity of Christians. On May 6, district police and soldiers searched the home of a church leader in Krong Pac district, Dak Lak, confiscating 273 Christian books and bibles. The search warrant stated that the church leader had stored literature which has the purpose of resisting and overthrowing the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. The church leader was summoned for numerous interrogation sessions over the next month and accused of violating the government's Decree on Religion. Minority land continues to be confiscated. In one incident on April 11, a Montagnard Christian in Buon Ea Sup, Dak Lak resisted the plowing over of his land. He was bound and gagged by a local gang, including government officials. On June 16, nine Montagnards were arrested in Dak Lak province and sent to the provincial prison in Buon Ma Thuot. Two other Montagnards were arrested in June in Cu Se district, Gia Lai and sent to T-20 prison in Pleiku. In July, four Jarai were arrested in Breng I, Breng II and Cu A villages in Gia Lai province, near the Cambodian border, and in Cu Se district, Gia Lai. In late August, three Montagnards were detained and beaten by police in Dak Doa district, Gia Lai. They subsequently went into hiding upon their release. From August 18 through early September, at least 18 Montagnards were arrested in Dak Lak province, most of whose whereabouts are currently unknown, other than three who are known to have been sent to the provincial prison in Buon Ma Thuot.","Asia, Vietnam","Religious Freedom"

Igwe, chairman of the Onitsha branch of the National Bar Association (NBA), had been an outspoken critic of Anambra state Governor Chinwoke Mbadinuju. Close colleagues who had also criticized the governor have faced threats and intimidation before and since his assassination.  “There is strong, credible evidence that Igwe and his wife were targeted for political reasons – because of Igwe’s and the NBA’s public criticism of the Anambra state government’s performance,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Their deaths highlight the risks faced by other critics of the government.”  Human Rights Watch called for an independent and impartial investigation into the killings and the prosecution of those responsible.  Barnabas Igwe and his wife Abigail, also a lawyer, were killed in Onitsha on September 1, the day after they returned from the southwestern town of Ibadan where they had attended a national conference of the NBA. They were traveling home when a group of assailants attacked them with machetes and shot them several times, then ran them over with their vehicle. According to the police, the perpetrators did not steal anything from the victims.  In the days preceding the killing, Igwe and other close colleagues who had denounced abuses by the state government received direct threats from senior officials in the Anambra state government, face to face and through telephone calls on personal mobile phones. The threats were explicitly linked to criticisms by Igwe and his colleagues of the state government’s failure to pay the salaries of government workers for several months. The lawyers had given the government a 21-day ultimatum to pay the salary arrears or resign; they had made these calls in public statements, widely broadcast through the media. State government officials had previously made repeated attempts to silence them, for example by offering bribes to withdraw their statements, which they rejected.  Human Rights Watch is urging the Anambra state and federal governments to take all measures necessary to ensure the safety of Igwe’s colleagues and to take prompt action against any official engaged in intimidation, threats or other abuses.  “We were alarmed to hear that people very close to the victims have been receiving death threats even since the killing of Igwe and his wife – including the very day after the killings, when at least one person was told that he would be next. We are extremely worried for their safety,” said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch is also concerned at reports that the police attempted to prevent a rally from taking place in Onitsha on September 18, organized by the NBA to express solidarity for the victims and to demand action. Apparently the police had been told that there would be violence at the rally. However, the organizers were simply planning a peaceful protest to condemn the killings and commemorate the victims.  “The authorities are responsible for ensuring that the police protect those taking part in peaceful demonstrations, whatever their message,” said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch also called for the immediate release of two relatives of Igwe, who were arrested on September 12 for distributing posters protesting the killing and demanding justice, and detained by police in the state capital Awka.  In response to accusations by the NBA and others that he was personally involved in planning the killing of Igwe and his wife, Governor Mbadinuju announced that he would set up a panel of inquiry. He has denied any involvement in the killing and has reportedly offered three different theories: that Igwe and his wife were killed by armed robbers (a theory the police have ruled out); that Igwe may have been targeted by people from his local community; and that the governor’s own political opponents had orchestrated the killing with the specific intention of blaming it on the governor.  “Only an independent investigation can reveal the truth and identify the real perpetrators,” said Takirambudde. “In view of the pattern of politically-motivated abuses in Anambra state in the last few years, and the impunity which has protected those responsible, we believe that an investigation should be set up by the federal government – especially in the face of allegations that the Anambra state governor himself may be personally implicated.”  Investigators should not include members of the state government or any other individuals who may have a direct interest in the outcome of the investigation.  “We are calling on the police, judicial authorities and federal government of Nigeria to ensure that those responsible for the murder of Igwe and his wife, as well as other cases of political killings, are brought to justice promptly and to end the impunity which has protected the perpetrators of such abuses until now,” said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch said that the Anambra state government should cooperate fully with the criminal investigation and should initiate disciplinary measures including suspension, as appropriate, of any state government officials responsible for issuing death threats.  This is not the first time that opponents of the Anambra state government have been targeted. In a report published in May 2002, Human Rights Watch and the Lagos-based Centre for Law Enforcement Education documented several other cases of politically motivated killings, arrests and torture by the Bakassi Boys, a vigilante group used by the Anambra state government to intimidate its opponents. Among those targeted for their perceived opposition to the state government were Prophet Eddie Okeke, killed in November 2000; Chief Ezeodumegwu G. Okonkwo, a local government chairman killed in February 2001; and Ifeanyi Ibegbu, minority leader of the Anambra State House of Assembly, detained and tortured by the Bakassi Boys in August 2000. No one has been prosecuted in these cases.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Kyrgyzstan's human rights record has steadily worsened since 2000, the year of presidential and parliamentary elections. Official actions in the past year indicate that the government's new relationship with the U.S. may have emboldened it, allowing it to suppress political opposition leaders without fear of diplomatic consequence. Kyrgyzstan today has serious human rights problems. The Akaev government has shown marked intolerance for political opposition, lodging politically motivated criminal charges against its rivals and critics. The right to freedom of assembly has been violated repeatedly, most dramatically in March 2002, when police opened fire on protesters, killing at least five people. In the meantime, Kyrgyzstan's aggressive stance against independent Islam began increasingly to resemble that of neighboring Uzbekistan, as dozens of non-violent Muslim believers have been rounded up, physically mistreated, and thrown into Kyrgyz jails.  Politicaly Motivated Charges Against the Opposition Feliks Kulov In the lead-up to the October 2000 presidential elections, government authorities ensured the exclusion from the ballot of President Akaev's most prominent rival, Feliks Kulov. The National Security Service (SNB) arrested Kulov, head of the Ar-Namys (Dignity) party on March 29, 2000 on trumped-up charges of abuse of office related to his time as head of the SNB. A military tribunal acquitted him in August 2000. The prosecutor's office appealed the acquittal, and one month later-just after Kulov announced his intent to run against Akaev in the presidential elections-police again arrested him. In January 2001, a court sentenced Kulov to seven years of imprisonment; in July, new charges of embezzlement were brought. Kulov remains Kyrgyzstan's most high-profile political prisoner today. In addition to serving as SNB head, Kulov had also been vice president of Kyrgyzstan, governor of the Chui province, and mayor of Bishkek, the nation's capital. He lost his bid for a seat in parliament under highly suspicious circumstances prior to being arrested in 2000. Azimbek Beknazarov Police arrested Azimbek Beknazarov, a popular member of parliament and chair of its judiciary committee, on January 5, 2002 on charges of failure to investigate a murder dating from 1995, when Beknazarov worked as a procuracy investigator in the southern Jalal Abad province. Beknazarov supporters and other opposition activists contend that his arrest was motivated by the Akaev government's interest in silencing his criticism of the decision to cede to China land that had been the subject of contention between the two states for years. The land decision was especially unpopular in southern Kyrgyzstan. Beknazarov had also actively voiced his view that President Akaev should face impeachment proceedings over the land issue. U.S. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher said at a briefing on March 19, 2002, that the U.S. government was concerned that """"Mr. Beknazarov's arrest appears to have been politically motivated."""" Following a trial allegedly marred by gross procedural violations, Beknazarov was due to be sentenced on March 18, 2002. Mass demonstrations shook Jalal Abad province on the eve of his sentencing. On May 24, a court handed down a one-year suspended sentence and stripped him of his seat in parliament. In June, an appeals court upheld the conviction but annulled the sentence, restoring his parliamentary mandate. Police Violence Against Demonstrators: Five Killed On March 17, 2002, at Kerben, in Aksy district in southern Jalal Abad province, police blocked marchers protesting the prosecution of Beknazarov. At one point, police began beating people in the crowd and reportedly grabbed Tursunbek Akunov, chair of the Human Rights Movement of Kyrgyzstan. Demonstrators demanded that police release Akunov and allegedly began throwing stones. Without giving the protesters sufficient time to disband, the police opened fire, killing at least five protesters and wounding many more. The U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials states that law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall use restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence. The legitimate objective should be achieved with minimal damage and injury, and preservation of human life respected. A government commission, headed by Oksana Malevanaia, chair of the parliamentary committee for human rights, issued a report on the Aksy events. The report concluded that an excessive police presence was employed to stop what was a legal public demonstration and that officers used excessive force when they shot live ammunition into the crowd. The commission found that five civilians died from gunshot wounds inflicted by the police, and that out of twenty-nine civilians injured, sixteen suffered bullet wounds. Unconfirmed media reports noted the death of a sixth civilian, injured by police during continued unrest on March 18. According to initial reports by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, forty-seven police officers were injured during the protests; the commission report noted that three had been hospitalized. In an apparent effort to shift the blame from the officers responsible for the killings, Minister of Internal Affairs Temirbek Akmataliev suggested that the violence was in fact a coup attempt on the part of the political opposition, which had """"embarked on [a] course of political extremism."""" Shortly after the shootings in Jalal Abad, Human Rights Watch called for the creation of an independent commission of inquiry to investigate incidents of police violence against demonstrators. Limits on the Right to Free Assembly Throughout the year, the government tried to arbitrarily limit public demonstrations. In September, the government attempted to introduce a bill in parliament calling for a three-month moratorium on all public demonstrations. It later withdrew the bill. In the months following the March demonstrations, police arrested between seven and ten people whom they claim organized the demonstrations, on charges that they had spearheaded """"mass disturbances."""" In an apparent attempt to discredit the political opposition's engagement in public assembly, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claimed that opposition political parties had paid people to take part in the Jalal Abad marches. In May, security forces in Bishkek arrested an estimated ninety peaceful demonstrators as they gathered for a planned protest outside the parliament building. Law enforcement officers appeared to particularly target members of Ar-Namys, who were among the demonstrators. Police charged the would-be demonstrators with """"violating public order;"""" most were subsequently released. Persecution of Human Rights Defenders In 2002 the Akaev government hounded numerous human rights defenders. Tursunbek Akunov, chair of the Human Rights Movement of Kyrgyzstan was reportedly a particular target of police harassment during the Aksy protests in March. As noted above, protesters claim that Akunov was held by police during the demonstrations. Shortly after the shootings, Minister of Internal Affairs Temirbek Akmataliev had the temerity to blame Akunov himself and for the five deaths. According to the BBC, on March 19 he said, """"I think that today with all responsibility we can say that the blame for the blood of the deceased lies on Tursunbek Akunov and his associates."""" Akunov was again detained when police broke up the planned May 2002 protest in Bishkek described above. Others detained in that incident included Ramazan Dyryldaev, chair of the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR), and Alexander Fomenko, Mamasadyk Jakyshev, and Kachkyn Bulatov, also of the KCHR. Among the seven individuals charged in relation to the Aksy demonstrations was Kadyrkul Omurbekov, who had been working to defend the rights of victims of the Aksy violence and their relatives.  Violations of Media Freedom For the past three years Kyrgyz authorities have manipulated registration procedures to keep tighter control of the media and have harassed independent newspapers through civil defamation suits in some cases seeking damages awards that would bankrupt the papers. Authorities have also pursued criminal libel suits against government critics. Among those charged with criminal libel this year is poet Asanbai Jusupbekov. In February the authorities charged him with """"spreading false information"""" (criminal code article 329) when he informed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), that parlimentarian Azimbek Beknazarov had been beaten in custody. Jusupbekov had visited Beknazarov in detention shortly before he made the report. According to PEN International, Jusupbekov subsequently went into hiding. After his release Beknazarav reported that he had indeed been beaten. Samagan Orozaliev, a television journalist, remains in prison at this writing on what appear to be politically motivated charges. Police arrested in Jalal Abad province in May 2001 when he was investigating allegations of local corruption for a documentary film. In November a court sentenced him to nine years of imprisonment for extortion, forgery, and illegal possession of a weapon. In January 2002, the government issued Decree No. 20, which would have further eroded media freedoms. The government subsequently rescinded the decree after an outcry from the international community. The decree drew up a series of burdensome restrictions on the right to publish and disseminate materials. Among the most onerous was the requirement that all printing equipment (broadly defined to include even copy machines) be registered with the state and strictly monitored by state agencies. The decree also revealed the government's attempt to censor independent religious thought. This was made explicit in the decree's introduction, which stated that it was intended """"to prevent subversive ideological and propagandizing activities by various extremist religious centers and [to prevent]...their informational impact...."""" The decree referred to unspecified religious publications as having an """"anti-state character"""" and characterized their dissemination as """"propaganda and subversive activities."""" To this end, the decree called on certain state agencies to regulate the number of religious groups and to conduct their own propaganda campaign to counter the """"unlawful activities of various religious movements."""" Religious Persecution in Kyrgyzstan The Kyrgyz government has begun to arrest Muslims whose beliefs it rejects. Although the scale of arrests is not yet the same, the policy disturbingly appeared to be mimicking that of Kyrgyzstan's neighbor, Uzbekistan, which has imprisoned about 7, 000 independent Muslims in the recent years. Such arrests directly violate practitioners fundamental right to religious freedom. The majority of Muslims affected by the new repression are members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, (Party of Liberation), a non-violent Islamic organization with a strict interpretation of the Koran, that advocates restoration of the Islamic Caliphate. Most Hizb ut-Tahrir members in Kyrgyzstan are ethnic Uzbeks. They are subject to fines, suspended sentences, or relatively brief stints in prison as punishment for what should be protected religious beliefs and activities. After the 1999 and 2000 armed incursions by the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU) into Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz courts began more actively to hand down prison sentences to Hizb ut-Tahrir members. In the year since September 11 the government again increased arrests of Hizb ut-Tahrir members and other independent Muslims, justifying the arrests as necessary to counter """"extremism,"""" prosecuting them under reworked Soviet laws that criminalize a vaguely defined """"incitement to racial enmity,"""" and directing courts to hand down harsh and lengthy terms in prison. The result has been dozens of illegal arrests and convictions, police mistreatment of religious dissidents, and an ever-expanding rift in society between independent religious adherents and followers of state-sponsored Islam.","Europe/Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan","Press Freedom, Religious Freedom"

Akaev rose to prominence in the Kyrgyz Communist Party, initially as head of its Department of Science and Higher Academic Institutions. He later became vice-president and then president of the Kyrgyz Academy of Sciences, and in 1990 became President of the Kyrgyz Soviet Socialist Republic. Running unopposed, Akaev won the presidency of independent Kyrgyzstan in 1991 and consolidated power through a presidential referendum in 1994. Akaev was re-elected to his second term of office in 1995. Despite a constitutional provision limiting the head of state to two terms in office, Akaev ran for president again in 2000. That year the government introduced mandatory Kyrgyz language testing for potential presidential candidates, which served to eliminate twelve of nineteen candidates. Three political leaders who intended to contest the elections were brought up on criminal charges and thus disqualified:  Daniar Usenov, then leader of the El-Bei Bechora (The Kyrgyz People's Party), was given a two-year suspended sentence on a four-year-old assault charge in which the plaintiff had withdrawn his original complaint; Topchubek Turgunaliev, founder of Kyrgyzstan's Guild of Prisoners of Conscience, was sentenced to sixteen years of imprisonment on trumped-up charges of plotting an attempt on President Akaev's life (he was subsequently pardoned in 2001); and Feliks Kulov, a former minister of national security, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment on politically motivated charges of abuse of office. As of this writing, Kulov remains in prison  Akaev was victorious with 74 percent of the vote, according to the official tally. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which sent monitors to the vote, declared that the election """"failed to comply with OSCE commitments for democratic elections.""""

In a letter sent last week, Human Rights Watch asked President Bush to use the meeting to seek concrete steps by President Akaev to improve human rights and to commit to genuine reform.  Once heralded as an island of democracy in a highly repressive region, Kyrgyzstan's human rights record has deteriorated steadily since presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000. In recent years, the government has jailed President Akaev's chief political rivals. One of them, former Vice President Feliks Kulov, remains in prison on politically motivated charges. The authorities have used registration procedures and civil defamation suits to harass the media. In the past year, the government attempted to put a temporary ban on all public demonstrations. In March, police shot to death five demonstrators who were protesting politically-motivated charges against a popular member of parliament.

""""President Bush has an opportunity now to ask for a turnaround.""""

Poverty, unemployment, drug addiction and prostitution are widespread among the young. People under 34 constitute half of the country's population. Many of them voted for the reformist president, Mohammed Khatami. Now they are deeply disappointed.   Khatami and his supporters know that the Iranian people expect them to deliver on their promises. In a major speech Aug. 28, the president acknowledged that his reform initiatives have been blocked, and pledged to take measures to implement """"real democracy."""" Millions of Iranians hope he can succeed. But after five years of unfulfilled promises, their hope is wearing thin.   If there is one clear enemy of human rights and political reform in Iran today, it is the judiciary. So when I recently met Mohammed Javad Larijani, the deputy head of the judiciary with responsibility for international affairs and human rights, a newly created post, I expected that we would vehemently disagree about almost everything.   Iran's judiciary has been the most effective weapon in the hands of conservatives under Iran's supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It is responsible for much repression and many egregious human rights violations.   But Larijani, a sophisticated man who speaks fluent English, made no apologies. He believes that both conservatives in the past and now reformists have proved to be incompetent to run the country. I was surprised to find myself agreeing with him.   President Khatami believes that change can only take place peacefully and within the framework of the Iranian constitution. But it is a flawed document that accords absolute power to the supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei.   Khamenei has given his full support to the hard-liners who are behind the shutdown of more than 85 publications in the last two years, the imprisonment of many journalists, writers and political activists, the crushing of student demonstrations and banning of political parties, and the imposition of even more restrictions on everyday life.   The conservatives have warned that any challenge to the status quo will result in bloodshed. Former President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani - during whose presidency government agents killed hundreds of Iranians, inside and outside the country, because of their political beliefs - has reportedly said that the conservative establishment would mobilize 2 million people in its support, and would not hesitate to use its 400,000-strong private army against the people to hold on to power.   How can the United States craft a policy toward Iran that is at the same time realistic and principled?   First, Washington must make clear that it rejects certain parts of the political spectrum. Reformists in Tehran were shocked that the foreign policy chief of the European Union, Javier Solaña, met with Rafsanjani during a recent visit to Tehran.   Clearly, it is hard for Washington to have much direct influence over internal affairs in Iran. When President George W. Bush called Iran part of the """"axis of evil,"""" he certainly gained the attention of all sides in Iran's complex power struggle. In many ways, Bush was right - for more than two decades, the Iranian government has perpetrated many cruel human rights abuses upon its people, and that is indeed evil. On the other hand, the saber-rattling that has accompanied Bush's use of the """"axis of evil"""" metaphor is deeply disturbing to Iranians, and has strengthened hard-liners who thrive on perpetuating conflict with the West.   At the same time, the United States should not hesitate to criticize Iran when such criticism is warranted. Khatami, while objecting to """"U.S. threats"""" against Iran, has made it clear that he is ready to open a dialogue with America without preconditions. In doing so, Khatami has distanced himself from conservatives who call it a crime to seek to normalize relations with the United States.   The Bush administration should take Khatami at his word, and approach Iran's elected leaders with its full range of concerns about Iranian policy. Several of those leaders have themselves objected, in the Iranian Parliament and elsewhere, to such practices as smuggling arms to the Palestinian Authority or harboring Al Qaeda suspects. The United States will find its criticism has supporters in various parts of the Iranian government.   The problem, of course, is that Iran's in-house critics, from the president on down, are powerless to bring about change. Still, in the murky domain of Iranian politics, the United States should not lose sight of the goal of helping to restore basic freedoms and human rights to the Iranian people. The Bush administration can best do that by engaging frankly and directly with their elected leaders.

Yuldash Rashulov, a member of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, was sentenced in Tashkent yesterday. Rasulov, who had helped people persecuted for their religious beliefs and affiliations, was charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order (article 159 of the criminal code), distributing """"extremist"""" literature (articles 244-1 and 244-2), and membership in a criminal organization. The evidence presented against him, however, only showed that he prayed five times a day and had listened to tapes on Islam commonly available in the mid-1990s. Furthermore, Rasulov claimed at trial that self-incriminating statements about his alleged involvement in """"extremist"""" activities were made after he had been pressured.  """"Rasulov should have been released today,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The evidence didn't support the verdict in this clearly political case.""""  In a written statement to Human Rights Watch, Rasulov said that during the investigation he had been beaten and abused, and that he had signed self-incriminating statements before reading them because he feared sharing the fate of Shovrik Ruzimuradov, one of his colleagues from the Karshi branch of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan who died in custody in 2001.  The trial began on September 3 in Tashkent's Yunosobad District Court. The court upheld the state's claim that Rasulov had spread """"Wahhabist"""" ideas, """"secretly"""" watched video tapes, and listened to audio tapes that strongly criticized the government. While reading the verdict today, Judge Tolib Obidov referred to imams and militants who are on a government blacklist, stating that Rasulov cooperated with them all in a conspiracy to spread """"Wahhabism."""" During the trial the prosecution presented no evidence of such cooperation, nor did it detail the criminal nature of the alleged cooperation.  In Central Asia """"Wahhabism"""" is a pejorative term for Islamic religious observance that falls beyond strict state controls, and is meant to imply """"Islamic fundamentalism."""" Those accused of """"Wahhabism"""" generally have no links to the Wahhabi branch of Sunni Islam.  Two men who had been detained together with Rasulov initially signed statements asserting that he had taught them Islam, and were then released. Called to serve as prosecution witnesses, they retracted these statements in court. Rasulov acknowledged that in the mid-90s he had listened to publicly available cassettes with friends that were about the moral precepts of Islam. He also gave evidence that he observed the five daily prayers of Islam. Two witnesses confirmed his testimony.  Human Rights Watch objected that Rasulov's exercise of his rights was used as evidence of criminality. """"Rasulov has the right to hold beliefs and to engage in protected speech, just like anyone else,"""" said Andersen. """"These are rights, not crimes.""""  After Rasulov's arrest on May 24, 2002, Uzbek law enforcement officials claimed that Rasulov had recruited young men for """"terrorist training camps abroad"""" and for the Taliban. But the court dropped charges against him relating to """"membership in a criminal organization,"""" commonly used in such cases.  """"The Uzbek authorities tried to convince the international community that Rasulov was involved in terrorism,"""" said Andersen. """"It's clear, though, that this was an attempt to discourage interventions on his behalf, to isolate him, and exploit fears of terrorism.""""  Government propaganda regarding the case, much like officials' statements accompanying past arrests of human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, seem aimed at discrediting legitimate human rights activity. """"The government really showed its hand this time,"""" said Andersen, of the attempts to smear Rasulov as a terrorist. """"The Uzbek government has jailed Rasulov to stop him from documenting human rights violations, and to silence other defenders. They've made Uzbekistan a slightly more dangerous place, not safer.""""  After his arrest in Karshi, Yuldash Rasulov was held in incommunicado detention for approximately one month in the basement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs headquarters in Tashkent. Only the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the U.K. embassy sent monitors to his trial.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

The EU and Syria are negotiating an Association Agreement, a trade pact which states that relations between the parties """"shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of [the agreements].""""

September 2002 Your Excellency, We are writing about the harsh crackdown on the nascent pro-democracy and human rights movement in Syria.

They include two outspoken members of parliament and a prominent economist. We urge the European Union and its member states to raise their cases at the highest level with Syrian government officials and campaign actively for their unconditional release. The ongoing Association Agreement negotiations between Syria and the EU present one of several forums for protesting the harsh criminal sentences handed down against these peaceful activists. Association agreements stipulate that relations between the parties """"shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of [the agreements]."""" The criminal prosecution and imprisonment of citizens for the mere exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and association make a mockery of these asserted principles. All of the men faced vaguely worded political charges such as """"attempting to change the constitution by illegal means"""" and """"spreading false information."""" Eight of the ten activists were tried and sentenced in the state security court, a judicial body whose procedures do not meet international fair-trial standards and whose judgments cannot be appealed, in violation of international human rights law. They are: Aref Dalila, prominent economist and university professor, sentenced to ten years in July 2002. He is a founding member of the Committees for the Revival of Civil Society. Habib Issa, a lawyer, sentenced to five years in August 2002. Mr. Issa is a founding member of the Human Rights Association of Syria and served as a spokesperson for the Gamal al-Atasi Forum for Democratic Dialogue, one of the many independent civil society groups that emerged following the death of former president Hafez al-Asad in 2000. Dr. Walid al-Bunni, a physician, sentenced to five years in July 2002. He helped launch the Human Rights Association of Syria last year. Fawaz Tello, an engineer, sentenced to five years in August 2002, who was active in the civil society movement. Dr. Kamal Labwani, a physician, sentenced to three years in August 2002, and an active member in the independent Committees for the Defense of Human Rights (CDF). Habib Saleh, a businessman, sentenced to three years in June 2002, also active in the country´s civil forums. Riad al-Turk, a 72-year-old lawyer and head of the unauthorized Communist Party-Political Bureau, sentenced to two and half years in June 2002. Mr. Turk was imprisoned without charge and held incommunicado from 1981 to 1998. Hassan Saadun, a teacher, sentenced to two years in August 2002. He too was active in the civil society movement. The two parliamentarians, both of whom were elected as independent candidates, were tried in Damascus criminal court. Mamoun al-Homsi was sentenced to five years imprisonment in March 2002, and Riad al-Seif to five years in April 2002. Their convictions were upheld on appeal. The imprisonment of these ten men is a gross violation of the internationally protected rights to freedom of expression and association. In addition, it only serves to reverse the momentum that had been building inside Syria to press for democratic reform, the lifting of martial law, accountability for past human rights abuses, and loosening the political grip of the ruling Ba´th Party. The intimidating effect of imposing harsh prison terms on peaceful political activists cannot be underestimated, particularly given the climate of fierce repression that Syrian citizens lived through for decades under the rule of the late president Hafez al-Asad. The European Union, the European Commission, and EU member states should take steps to ensure that the cases of these reformers and proponents of democracy are raised at the highest levels with Syrian government officials. We urge the EU to send a clear message to Damascus that further negotiations of the Association Agreement will not proceed until the ten men are released unconditionally, with full restoration of their civil and political rights, including the ability to leave and enter the country freely.","Middle East/North Africa, Syria","Free Speech"

The forty-seven page report focuses on federally funded """"abstinence-only-until-marriage"""" programs in Texas, where advertising campaigns convey the message that teenagers should not use condoms because they don't work. Some school-based programs in Texas do not mention condoms at all. Federal health agencies share the broad scientific consensus that condoms, when used correctly, are highly effective in preventing the transmission of HIV. Yet the U.S. government currently spends more than $100 million each year on """"abstinence-only-until-marriage"""" programs, which cannot by law """"promote or endorse"""" condoms or provide instruction regarding their use. The Bush administration is advocating a 33 percent increase in funding for these programs. """"The Bush administration wants to spend millions more dollars on abstinence-only programs that put teenagers at higher risk for HIV,"""" said Rebecca Schleifer, HIV/AIDS researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"In Texas, these programs don't just censor information, they actively promote misinformation about condoms. And they deprive adolescents of one of the most important tools that they need to protect themselves from HIV."""" U.S. federal government organizations that set public health standards, including the Institute of Medicine, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control, all agree that providing complete and accurate information to adolescents about the proper use of condoms to reduce the risk of HIV transmission is an essential part of the limited anti-HIV arsenal. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has included among its objectives increasing the proportion of adolescents who """"use condoms if sexually active.""""  This policy clearly puts these federal government organizations at odds with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' divisions that run the abstinence-only programs, which cannot by law provide this advice. Texas' programs provide no such information. In McLennan County, which has one of the state's highest rates of teen pregnancy, the federally funded """"Truth for Youth"""" radio and television ad campaign suggests that parents who advise their children to use condoms may actually be putting their children's lives at risk. Adolescents and adults who have heard these ads report that they don't use or don't trust condoms because they heard on television or radio that they don't work. Another federally funded program in Temple, Texas plans to include an exercise that compares pieces of latex condoms with plastic of different thicknesses that is designed to teach that condoms are not effective because they are thinner than many kinds of plastic, and easily broken by fingernails. Teachers in Laredo's abstinence program don't mention condoms at all.  Texas' commitment to abstinence-only programs has infected other sources of HIV/AIDS prevention information by restricting access to experts on HIV/AIDS prevention and by crowding out other sources of HIV prevention information. An HIV/AIDS educator in McLennan County was told that she could not speak to students in an abstinence-only classroom about prevention of HIV by using condoms. Many recipients of federal HIV prevention money likewise provide limited or no information about condoms in their HIV prevention trainings. Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs are particularly harmful to gay and lesbian adolescents. The programs must teach that marriage is the only appropriate context for sexual activity and further that """"sexual activity outside of the context of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects."""" Federal law limits marriage to heterosexual couples. And, same-sex couples can't legally marry in any U.S. state.  """"Teaching gay and lesbian youth that there is no safe way for them to have a sexual relationship-even when they become adults-only reinforces the hostile environment that many of them already experience at school,"""" said Schleifer. """"Denying them access to relevant and potentially life-saving information about how to have a safe sexual relationship only makes this situation worse.""""  Human Rights Watch's report focuses on Texas to illustrate problems posed by abstinence-only programs nationwide. Texas receives a substantial share of federal abstinence-only funding, and its programs command nationwide influence. Two of its programs are among the eleven chosen for an evaluation of federally funded abstinence-only programs.  Human Rights Watch found that federally funded abstinence-only-until-marriage programs in Texas interfere with fundamental rights guaranteed by international law, including the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds and the right to the highest attainable standard of health. Because AIDS is a fatal disease that yet has no cure, the government's failure to provide complete and accurate information about HIV/AIDS prevention may also impede the right to life. Human Rights Watch calls on the U.S. government to repeal abstinence-only-until-marriage legislation and to enact in its place legislation supporting comprehensive sex education that would include information and instruction about HIV/AIDS prevention, including the use of condoms for this purpose.","United States","Children's Rights, Health, LGBT Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

The General Assembly will begin discussion today of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD). The first development program to be fully conceived and designed by Africans themselves, NEPAD recognizes the centrality of good governance, democracy and human rights in the quest for development, but then does little to elaborate what that means in practice.  “It is tempting for member states to want to focus on traditional development projects,” said Peter Takirambudde, director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division. “Such projects are less controversial and provide measurable results. But, NEPAD’s success hinges upon the political reforms that are more difficult and that need international support. These are the initiatives that can really transform Africa.”  NEPAD addresses political governance and human rights primarily through the Declaration on Democracy, Political, Economic, and Corporate Governance and the African Peer Review Mechanism (APRM), which were officially adopted by the African Union (AU) at the Durban Summit (July 8-10). The Declaration seeks to codify a set of standards and practices that AU members will uphold. The reforms outlined in the Declaration on Democracy include the rule of law, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to association and peaceful assembly, and the right to vote and be elected.  The APRM states that the particular circumstances and different levels of development of countries in the APRM will be taken into consideration during evaluations. While acknowledging that the APRM must consider a nation’s particular macroeconomic conditions in assessing compliance with economic and corporate governance standards, Human Rights Watch said that the APRM should not endorse varying standards of good governance, respect for human rights and democracy under any circumstances.  “The standards articulated in the Declaration must be applied uniformly. The commitments expressly outlined in the Declaration constitute a minimum set of human rights and political reforms,” said Takirambudde.  Takirambudde urged that member states should be certain to emphasize the importance of involving non-governmental actors in NEPAD’s development to help address NEPAD’s apparently weak efforts on behalf of Africa’s most marginalized and vulnerable people—women, children, refugees, the internally displaced and those affected by HIV/AIDS. “The non-governmental community will have to play an active role in holding governments accountable,” said Takirambudde","Africa, Global","United Nations"

As head of Aizhi (AIDS) Action Project, he defied regulations restricting whole categories of information from appearing on the Internet, including one that limits news postings to official versions. Instead, Wan told it like it was, using the Internet to inform as wide an audience as he could about AIDS, even posting a """"secret"""" internal government document containing epidemiological data from Henan province on the project's Web site. The site, www.aizhi.org, was recently shut down by the university department that hosted it. Then on Aug. 24 a cell phone call reportedly prompted Wan to leave his companions at a Beijing cafe. As he stepped outside, a car drove up, several men pulled him inside and immediately drove off. Now, Wan's family reports, he is being detained by state security on suspicion of """"leaking state secrets."""" But silencing the messenger will not undermine the importance of the message. AIDS has reached virtually every province in China. It is rural victims who have drawn the most attention. For decades, poor Chinese farmers have sold their blood to augment their incomes. By 1985, the United States and Britain were screening blood for the presence of the AIDS virus. By 1987 the State Council, China's executive body had approved regulations on surveillance and control measures applicable to AIDS. But at blood stations in China's rural areas, typically run by local health officials who profited from the sales, the regulations were never implemented. Instead, technicians extracted the plasma, pooled the remaining red blood cells and to encourage repeat sales, injected the now cross-contaminated blood back into the donors, thus spreading the AIDS virus. In one village in Henan province alone, 65 percent of the population reportedly became infected. Experts estimate that nearly a million people in Henan are infected with HIV. Recently the Chinese government has begun to take a strong public stance on the AIDS epidemic but has kept silent about the Henan blood scandal. Despite persistent reports of people with HIV living in rural areas, it took 13 years from the date that the State Council blood screening regulations were promulgated for the government finally to admit that blood pooling had deadly consequences for donors. Today, although millions of Chinese citizens do not know how the disease is transmitted, officials are still making it clear they will remain the final arbiters of information flow within and outside China's borders. Wan had been expected in Montreal in September to accept the first international Award for Action on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, given by Human Rights Watch and the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. Village cadres earlier banned Dr. Gao Yaojie, another activist who exposed the epidemic in Henan province, from working with the people whose illness she had identified. Official media lauded Gao, but Chinese provincial officials refused to grant her leave to travel to the United States to receive the Jonathan Mann Award for Health and Human Rights. To combat China's growing AIDS crisis, the national government must compel local governments to report accurately on the epidemic and to stop harassing local activists. The government is not doing enough to assist families decimated by the disease, and must also protect sufferers and their families from discrimination. Finally, it is urgent that the Chinese government lift controls on freedom of information regarding AIDS and disseminate information to the public. When it wants to, China's leadership has no trouble getting its message to the public. Why not now?

Since late December 2001, both India and Pakistan have emplaced large numbers of antipersonnel mines along their common border in what may be one of the largest-scale mine-laying operations anywhere in the world in decades.  The 922-page report comes during the five-year anniversary of the negotiations of the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which comprehensively prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel mines. One hundred and twenty-five countries are party to the treaty and another 18 have signed but not yet ratified. The United States is among those that have not yet joined.  """"A few holdout governments are undercutting the progress of all the rest,"""" said Stephen Goose of Human Rights Watch, a founding member of the ICBL, which received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize. """"Three-quarters of the countries in the world have renounced the antipersonnel mine, and together they need to bring more pressure on the recalcitrant few.""""  Human Rights Watch is the coordinator and chief editor of the ICBL's Landmine Monitor Report 2002: Toward a Mine-Free World. It finds that in the most recent reporting period (since May 2001), the number of governments using antipersonnel mines dropped to nine, compared to at least 13 the prior year. Moreover, two of those nine--Angola and Sri Lanka--stopped mine use in 2002 and have not resumed.  The report also cites extensive ongoing use of antipersonnel mines by the governments of Myanmar and Russia (in Chechnya), and lesser-scale ongoing use by Nepal and Somalia. In addition, despite a declared use moratorium in place since 1996, Georgian forces apparently laid antipersonnel mines in the Kodori Gorge next to the Abkhazia region in 2001.  Human Rights Watch also condemned the use of antipersonnel mines by armed non-state actors in at least 14 countries in the past year. In Afghanistan, in the fighting following September 11, there were reports of limited use of mines and booby-traps by Taliban and Al-Qaeda fighters, as well as the Northern Alliance. There were no instances of use of antipersonnel mines by the United States or coalition forces.  In another disturbing development, Iran, which ostensibly instituted an export moratorium on antipersonnel mines in 1997, has apparently provided mines to combatants in Afghanistan and elsewhere. Mine clearance organizations in Afghanistan are encountering many Iranian-manufactured antipersonnel mines dated 1999 and 2000.  Despite these instances of ongoing use and transfer, overall progress in eradicating antipersonnel mines continues to be impressive. """"It is abundantly clear that the Mine Ban Treaty and the ban movement more generally are making tremendous strides in saving lives and limbs in every region of the world,"""" said Goose.  Thirty-four million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed by 61 countries, including seven million in the past year. In addition to the reduction in use, the number of antipersonnel mine producers has dropped from 55 to 14, while global trade in the weapon is now limited to a smattering of illicit or covert transactions.  The number of new mine casualties each year, estimated since the early 1990s at more than 26,000 per year, is now thought to be some 15-20,000 per year. Landmine Monitor identified 7,987 new reported casualties in 2001, roughly the same number as in 2000, but many casualties go unreported.  Governments have spent over $1.4 billion on mine clearance and other mine action programs in the past decade, including some $237 million in 2001. This is approximately the same amount as in 2000, marking the first time since 1992 that global mine action funding did not increase by a significant amount. The United States remained the largest donor at $69 million in 2001, but this represented a decrease of $13 million.  Eight countries became States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty in the most recent Landmine Monitor reporting period, including three countries that have recently used antipersonnel mines but now reject the weapon--Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Eritrea-as well as regional leaders Nigeria and Chile. More than a dozen other governments have pledged to join in the near future, including Afghanistan, Greece, Indonesia, Turkey and Yugoslavia.  The Landmine Monitor Report 2002 is the fourth annual ICBL report, and contains information related to landmines for every country of the world. On Monday, September 16, the ICBL will present Landmine Monitor Report 2002 to diplomats attending the Fourth Meeting of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty in Geneva. An Executive Summary is also available. A total of 115 Landmine Monitor researchers in 90 countries systematically collected and analyzed information from a wide variety of sources for this comprehensive report.  Human Rights Watch is a privately-funded international monitoring group based in New York. It coordinates the Landmine Monitor initiative.","Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Iran, Global","Arms, Landmines"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/09/13/letter-asem-summit-participant-countries","Letter to ASEM summit participant countries","Letter to ASEM summit participant countries","","09/13/2002","We write in advance of the fourth Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) in Copenhagen, which will bring together the heads of state of Brunei, China, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and members of the European Union. The summit meeting presents an important opportunity for European Union members to promote human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in Asia. Many of the important international challenges on your agenda have a critical human rights dimension, such as safeguarding human rights in counter-terrorist measures; respecting the rights of refugees, asylum seekers, trafficked persons and migrants; and strengthening the protection of trafficked persons and children in armed conflict and other hazardous situations. We hope EU leaders will also encourage their Asian counterparts to join with them in support of the new International Criminal Court.   EU-China Summit   In preparation for the EU-China summit on September 24 in Copenhagen, we have enclosed summaries of two recent Human Rights Watch reports on China dealing with labour unrest, and the political abuse of psychiatry in China. While cooperating with the International Labour Organisation on other issues, Beijing has refused the ILO's request to send a direct contact mission to China on freedom of association. The EU should urge China to accept such a mission, and also raise the cases of four NE China labour activists charged with organizing last year's massive labour protests; they have yet to be put on trial.   On the issue of psychiatric abuse, the World Psychiatric Association passed a resolution at its membership meeting in Yokohama last month to send an independent team to assess cases of alleged political abuse. However China is now apparently backing off from agreeing to such a visit. The EU should call on China to cooperate fully with the WPA, and to take immediate steps to end the detention of Falun Gong members, labour activists, whistle-blowers and others in psychiatric hospitals.   We are also enclosing a background memorandum on human rights abuses in Xinjiang, where China has attempted to justify its broad crackdown on Uighurs and Moslems on anti-terrorism grounds. It would be extremely useful if China would give unrestricted access to Xinjiang by private human rights monitors, U.N. human rights experts and international trial observers. We urge you to raise these concerns during the Summit discussions with Chinese officials, and to make the E.U.'s concerns public.   Human rights and counter-terrorism   As one of the themes of the ASEM summit will be international cooperation against terrorism, Human Rights Watch would like to stress the importance of ensuring that the fight against terrorism is conducted with full observance of international human rights standards. In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the international community has rightly directed efforts to bringing those responsible for the attacks to justice. However, we are concerned about the opportunistic attacks on civil liberties and repression of political opponents that some governments are conducting in the name of the anti-terror campaign as well as new restrictive or punitive policies against refugees, asylum-seekers and other foreigners.   At their meeting in Madrid in June 2002, ASEM Foreign Ministers endorsed new forms of cooperation among ASEM members against terrorist threats, particularly through increased intelligence exchange. They called for a """"comprehensive strategy against terrorism, which includes political, economic, and cultural measures, while respecting the rule of law."""" An ASEM expert seminar on anti-terrorism will be hosted by China shortly after your summit.   Human Rights Watch agrees that terrorism will not be defeated by solely military or technical means. Success against terrorism over the long term will require a comprehensive approach, as called for by ASEM foreign ministers, which addresses the human rights violations that give rise to violence and extremism by precluding the resolution of grievances through peaceful, democratic processes. It will also mean ensuring that action against terrorism does not compromise fundamental rights and freedoms and fully complies with the international human rights and humanitarian law standards that help define the moral boundaries that terrorism transgresses.   Human Rights Watch is concerned that many governments, including ASEM members, have used the anti-terror campaign as an opportunity to repress political opponents, curb civil liberties unnecessarily, and tighten arbitrarily restrictive and punitive policies against refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and other foreigners. China, for instance, has used the international anti-terrorist agenda to justify its broad repression of ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang, including peaceful activists and Moslem religious groups. Malaysia has adopted the same pretext to justify its use of the draconian Internal Security Act against supporters of gaoled former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and other opposition supporters. In Europe, the U.K. has introduced measures that permit the prolonged arbitrary detention without adequate judicial review of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity. The past year has seen a continued failure by European states, at the national and European Union levels, to protect the fundamental rights of migrants, including adequate conditions of detention, protection from discrimination and from arbitrary decisionmaking regarding detention and deportation, meaningful access to asylum procedures, and protection from refoulement.   Human Rights Watch urges ASEM leaders to affirm, clearly and strongly, that counter-terrorist measures must comply fully with international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law. This clear statement of principle should guide the work of the upcoming ASEM seminar on anti-terrorism and official working groups developing cooperation on these issues within the ASEM framework. In this respect, ASEM should ensure that any definition of terrorism is restricted to recognizable crimes, and not be so wide as to constrain legitimate political activity; that measures to facilitate the extradition and prosecution of terrorist suspects guarantee full safeguards for fair trial and protection against torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and application of the death penalty; and that any measures undertaken in the areas of immigration and asylum recognize the fundamental human rights of all migrants and refugees, regardless of their status and, in particular, provide adequate protection for victims of trafficking, access to full and fair asylum procedures, and the prohibition of refoulement.   Afghanistan    One related issue in which ASEM members have a critical interest is the future stability and security of Afghanistan. ASEM members have played a leadership role in promoting Afghanistan's reconstruction and development, notably Germany in hosting the Bonn peace conference and Japan the major donors' meeting in Tokyo. It is critical that this significant investment in the future of Afghanistan be safeguarded against continuing threats and insecurity and that assistance pledged at Tokyo is actually delivered as quickly as possible. Human Rights Watch believes that an expanded international security presence is essential if effective political and economic reconstruction is to take place in Afghanistan. Despite the technical assistance now being provided by some ASEM members, Afghanistan's police force and national army are still a long way from being able to ensure security throughout the country. Authorities across Afghanistan - Chairman Hamid Karzai, provincial governors, civil society leaders, and even some warlords - recognize this pressing problem and have called for a deployment of international forces to provide greater security in key cities and on roads around the nation. Italy is taking the lead in international efforts to assist with building the legal system, but these efforts cannot be fully realized until better security is assured.   Human Rights Watch welcomed the recent shift in U.S. opposition to ISAF expansion. We urge E.U. governments and members of the Permanent Five to consult and quickly agree on a U.N. Security Council resolution to gradually expand ISAF to areas outside Kabul, and to pledge support in the form of troops, funding and logistical backup.   Migration, trafficking and asylum   Another common international challenge on your agenda is the management of migration flows in ways that fully respect the rights of refugees, asylum seekers and both regular and irregular migrants, as well as ensure the proper protection of trafficked persons. We note the conclusions of the recent ASEM ministerial conference on cooperation for the management of migration flows between Europe and Asia, held in Lanzarote in April 2002. We are concerned, however, that this important initiative fails to accord appropriate consideration to the fundamental rights of migrants, regardless of their status.   Specifically, the ministerial declaration commits ASEM members to cooperate on return and readmission of """"illegal"""" immigrants, but downplays the rights of such migrants. With respect to """"legal"""" immigrants, the declaration acknowledges that member states must """"protect their rights and ensure them fair treatment."""" But as for """"illegal"""" immigrants, ASEM states committed only to affect repatriation """"in a humane and dignified manner,"""" ignoring migrants' - even """"illegal"""" migrants' - fundamental rights, including the right to life, the right to protection against arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, and rights relating to the length and conditions of detention. These are more than semantic differences, when considered against he backdrop of E.U. member states' increasingly restrictive immigration policies and the regular violation of all of these fundamental migrants' rights. In undertaking joint action in the field of migration, ASEM states should undertake to abide by their binding legal obligations to migrants, regardless of their legal status.   Protection of children   Human Rights Watch welcomes the child welfare initiative ASEM leaders took at their 1999 meeting in London, aimed at promoting international cooperation on child rights, with a special focus on sexual exploitation of children. We congratulate the government of Japan on its successful hosting in Yokohama of the Second World Congress on the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Human Rights Watch was also encouraged by the leadership role played by many ASEM governments at this year's U.N. General Assembly Special Session on Children, in particular by ratifying the new Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. We urge those governments that have not yet done so to sign and ratify this important instrument to help lay the foundation for a global ban on the use of children as soldiers.   Human Rights Watch was disappointed that, in the face of U.S. pressure, the outcome document from the Special Session was extremely weak in affirming the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the global standard for children's rights. We urge your governments, which have strongly championed children's rights in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora, to issue a public statement reaffirming your commitment to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and to incorporate implementation of the Convention into future ASEM activities and the national action plans mandated at the Special Session.   As part of its child welfare initiative, we urge ASEM to give special attention to the protection of children from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation, which was recognized as one of four priority areas at the recent Special Session on Children. Specifically, we request a commitment from all ASEM countries to provide support for the new in-depth study on violence against children that was requested by the General Assembly in December 2001, and will soon commence under the leadership of an independent expert selected by the Secretary-General.   Workers' Rights   Throughout Asia, workers suffer myriad violations of internationally recognized labor rights, including freedom of association, the abolition of the worst forms of child labor, and the elimination of employment discrimination. In its forthcoming Communication on Promoting a European Framework for Corporate Social Responsibility, the European Commission should encourage E.U. companies to demand respect for labor rights on both their directly-owned and independent supplier facilities and sub-contractors, and to report publicly on compliance with labor rights throughout their supply chains. The European Union should also encourage Asian governments to enforce existing labor laws that protect workers' human rights and to ratify key U.N. and I.L.O conventions dealing with the rights migrants, free association and collective bargaining. The E.U. can offer technical assistance to help bring domestic laws into compliance with international standards, and set up a working group within ASEM to coordinate such assistance.   International Criminal Court   One of the singular achievements for human rights over the past year is the establishment of the International Criminal Court. European Union members have played a critical leadership role in making the new Court a reality. To date, however, the ICC Treaty has been ratified by very few states in the Asia-Pacific region, and by none of ASEM's Asian partners. The Philippines, Thailand and the Republic of Korea have signed the treaty, but have reportedly come under U.S. pressure not to ratify. In line with the European Union's Common Position on the ICC, we urge you to use the ASEM summit to promote ratification of the ICC Treaty by Asian states. The European Union should offer governments in the region advice and technical assistance on the issues involved, including the enactment of national implementing legislation.   At the time of your meeting, the United States is in the process of seeking bilateral agreements with many European and other states that would require them to send an accused American citizen back to the United States instead of surrendering him/her to the ICC. We are aware that the European Union is in the midst of formulating its common response to this demand, but we urge you to use the Copenhagen meeting to sensitize ASEM partners to the fundamental principles of international law at stake, and encourage them to refuse any such bilateral agreements with the United States which would be in violation of the ICC Treaty, or at the very least defer negotiations and confer with European partners and other members of the Like-Minded Group. Now is the time for the European Union to work with supporters of the Court in other regions to safeguard the Court's effectiveness and legitimacy and reject any attempts to undermine this important institution.   Burma    While we recognize that the question of ASEM expansion, including the possible addition of Burma, will be on the agenda for the next ASEM summit in Hanoi, we hope that the Copenhagen ASEM will reinforce the concerns expressed by the E.U. foreign ministers at their Madrid meeting in June, welcoming Burma's cooperation with the U.N.'s special envoy and the U.N.'s special rapporteur and calling on Burma to release all political prisoners, end all forced labour, and end the recruitment and use as soldiers of children under the age of 18. In light of the EU troika visit to Burma from September 8 - 10, it is important to keep up the pressure for the lifting of restrictions on freedom of expression, association and assembly and to continue to provide humanitarian assistance especially on HIV-AIDS prevention and treatment.   We appreciate your attention to our concerns and trust that you will raise them in your discussion on September 22. We wish you a fruitful meeting and look forward to a continued dialogue with you.

A diplomatic source close to the case reported that Kazakh authorities intend to deport dissident Gulgeldi Annaniazov on Sunday, September 15.  """"This is a matter of life or death,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Turkmenistan is one of the most repressive countries in the world. The entire international community in Kazakhstan should make sure that Annaniazov is not deported, has the opportunity to apply for refugee status, and has access to a lawyer and, if necessary, a doctor.""""  Annaniazov is currently being held incommunicado by the Kazakh Committee for National Security (formerly the KGB) in Pavlodar, in northeastern Kazakhstan. As of September 11, Kazakh authorities had not allowed the Kazakhstan office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to interview him, nor have they allowed him access to a public defender or representatives of local human rights groups. Deporting Annaniazov to Turkmenistan would be in violation of Kazakstan's obligations as a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the Convention against Torture not to return someone to a country where they face the risk of torture or other forms of persecution.  Case background In 1995, Gulgeldi Annaniazov was sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for the role he played in organizing a demonstration in Ashgabat. The protest, unprecedented in Turkmenistan, called for democratic elections, among other things. Annaniazov is one of the """"Ashgabad Eight,"""" who were all imprisoned in relation to the protest and later released after an international campaign on their behalf. Annaniazov was released in 1999, but he and his family were then subjected to constant surveillance. Many believe he was on a """"black list"""" of individuals banned from travel abroad.  At the end of August 2002, Annaniazov, 42, fled from Turkmenistan to Kazakhstan, and then to Russia on September 1, seeking asylum. The next day Russian authorities deported him back to Kazakhstan without allowing him to apply for political asylum, allegedly because he arrived on a false passport.  Kazakh officials have disregarded intense diplomatic pressure aimed at preventing deportation and allowing the UNHCR to have access to Annaniazov. The United States has been particularly active in pressing Annaniazov's case.  """"Sending Annaniazov to Turkmenistan would show the Kazakh government's complete disdain both for its international obligations and for the concerns of the international community,"""" said Andersen. """"This case is no different from the worst days of the Soviet era. But what government would have deported a Soviet dissident back to Moscow in 1971?""""  The Turkmen government tolerates no free media or political opposition and crushes many forms of free expression and belief. In 2000, President Saparmurat Niazov was declared president for life. Most Turkmen opposition figures were driven into exile in the early 1990s, the remainder were thrown in prison and tortured. Most were released, and after the awful prison experience and constant surveillance afterward do not dare speak out again.  The Russian Orthodox Church and government-approved Sunni Islam are the only religions that may operate houses of worship. The government has banned opera, ballet, the philharmonia, and even the circus. Non-Turkmen cultural organizations are banned.","Europe/Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan",""

Bush should strongly object to recent moves to limit democracy in Pakistan and should call for immediate reforms, Human Rights Watch said today. Bush should make it clear that U.S. support for Pakistan because of its role in the anti-terrorism effort does not give the military leader a blank check to abuse human rights and undermine democratic processes. """"Bush should stress that the fight against terror must not take place at the expense of democracy,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The United States should provide no support for the parliamentary elections in October unless Musharraf enacts genuine reforms.""""  Human Rights Watch urged Bush to press Musharraf, who seized power in a coup on October 12, 1999, to withdraw constitutional amendments he unilaterally imposed last month strengthening the role of the military in the government and extending his presidential term five years. Bush should also urge Musharraf to immediately rescind all restrictions on political meetings and rallies imposed after the coup. Parliamentary elections are set for October 10, mandated by the Pakistan Supreme Court. Thus far, the Bush Administration has downplayed criticism of Musharraf's actions.  Bush should also warn that future U.S. aid could be jeopardized if Musharraf continues to take actions that set back prospects for restoring civilian, constitutional rule.  Since 2001, the U.S. Congress has voted for more than $640 million in emergency economic support for Pakistan, as well as military aid and law enforcement and anti-crime assistance. The foreign aid bill for fiscal year 2003, still pending in Congress, would give another $200 million in economic support to the government, plus $50 million each for development assistance and military aid. During their meeting, Musharraf is expected to ask Bush for more aid.  """"By undermining democratic institutions and restricting channels for political activity, Musharraf only helps the extremists in Pakistan,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"In the end, it's counter-productive.""""  Background In advance of the October elections, President Pervez Musharraf took measures calculated to ensure the military's dominance of Pakistan's democracy and a restricted role for the opposition. These include a referendum that ensured his rule for at least another five years, constitutional amendments that formalized the military's role in governance, restrictions on political party activities, and increasingly transparent support for pro-Musharraf parties.  In early April, President Musharraf announced plans to hold a nationwide referendum on a five-year extension of his presidency. The referendum was preceded by a month-long campaign by Musharraf, while a standing ban on public rallies prevented political parties from campaigning effectively against it. Official results for the referendum, held on April 30, showed a 97.5 percent vote in favor of Musharraf. Independent observers, including the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) and Pakistani journalists, found evidence of widespread fraud and coerced voting.  On August 22, 2002, Musharraf promulgated the Legal Framework Order (LFO), which included a controversial set of constitutional amendments. Taken together, the amendments strengthened the power of the presidency, formalized the role of the army in governance, and diminished the authority of elected representatives. The amendments also significantly curbed freedom of association and the freedom of individuals to stand for elected office.  The LFO restored Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution, which had been originally introduced under the martial law regime of General Mohammad Zia-ul Haq and repealed by an act of parliament in 1997. The Article allowed the president to dissolve the National Assembly if a situation arose in which government could not be carried out """"in accordance with the Constitution."""" Used frequently by the military to dismiss successive elected governments in Pakistan, the article formed a key element of what Musharraf termed necessary checks and balances in the country's system of government.  The amendments also created a National Security Council (NSC) that would not only serve as a consultative body on strategic matters, but would also advise on """"democracy, governance and inter-provincial harmony."""" Although the NSC is to include elected civilian leaders, ultimate authority appeared certain to rest with the serving military officers on the Council, including Musharraf in his dual capacities as President and Army Chief of Staff, as well as the heads of the navy and air force, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee. The NSC will in effect be a """"super-cabinet.""""  Other amendments in the LFO included limiting candidates for election to the National Assembly or Senate to persons who have attained a bachelor's degree. Given the country's poor educational infrastructure and sharp social and gender inequalities, the provision inevitably barred all but a small percentage of the citizenry from holding parliamentary office; more immediately, it disqualified a number of regional political leaders from standing for office in the October elections. Criminal convicts, defaulters on loans and utility bills, and absconders from court proceedings were likewise disqualified under the LGO from candidacy. The criteria appeared designed to ensure the disqualification of former prime ministers Nawaz Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, and others.  The LFO also circumscribed the right to form or be a member of political parties based on the government's interest in maintaining """"public order."""" Preventive detention under the Maintenance of Public Order ordinance has routinely been used in Pakistan to quell political protests, including planned demonstrations by political parties across the country during 2001 in support of the restoration of democracy. The amendment could potentially apply the same ill-defined criteria to the right to form or operate political parties, particularly where those parties have sought to mobilize public opinion against government decisions or military intervention.  The government announced in late August that the ban on political rallies, imposed shortly after the coup, would be lifted on September 1. With just over a month left before the elections, the timing of the announcement was criticized by local commentators as leaving political parties little opportunity to mount effective campaigns. The government also maintained significant restrictions on political meetings; rallies and processions on streets, roads and railway stations remained prohibited, and provincial and district administrations were given authority to determine the time and place of meetings. Political parties were required to consult with the authorities about their activities in advance.  Pakistan is clearly facing a series of difficult challenges in restoring democratic, civilian rule. The U.S. should be much more vigorous in promoting reform; Bush's meeting with Musharraf provides a key opportunity to elevate these concerns on the U.S. policy agenda.","Asia, United States, Pakistan","United Nations"

Congo: Kabila Should Prove Commitment to Human Rights","","09/11/2002","President Joseph Kabila of Congo should use his visit to the United Nations General Assembly, starting today, to announce the release of one of the country's leading human rights defenders, Human Rights Watch said today.  N'sii Luanda Shandwe has been held in Kinshasa for more than four months and is charged with treason and sheltering criminals. He is facing trial before the Military Order Court, and could be sentenced to death if found guilty.  N'sii Luanda, who is the head of the Committee for the Observation of Human Rights (CODHO), is apparently being held because he hosted a former political detainee at his house. He is detained at the Centre Pénitentiaire et de Rééducation de Kinshasa and has recently been suffering from malaria.  """"Human rights defenders all over Congo are regularly being harassed and arrested,"""" said Juliane Kippenberg of Africa division at Human Rights Watch. She urged President Kabila to show his commitment to human rights by taking the practical step of releasing N'sii Luanda during his visit, or having him transferred to a civilian court to be tried in accordance with international fair trial standards.  Human Rights Watch has sought a meeting with President Kabila during his current visit to the United States to discuss the case of N'sii Luanda, as well as other issues of human rights protection.  Methods of intimidation and obstruction against human rights defenders in rebel-controlled areas of Congo are strangely similar to those in government-held areas. On September 3, forces of the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) arrested a human rights activist in Aru, northeastern Congo. Honoré Mosoko, from Justice Plus, was detained until September 6, evidently because he had given an interview critical about the RCD-ML to Voice of America. The RCD-ML is one of several rebel factions that have been backed by the Ugandan government.  In Goma, activists of Study and Action Group for a Well-Defined Development (GEAD) have been unable to do their work since May 2002, when soldiers of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) occupied their offices. The RCD is a Rwandan-backed rebel force that controls large parts of eastern Congo. In May, RCD soldiers seized documents and equipment from GEAD, locked the office and left soldiers guarding the building. During the night of May 29, soldiers visited the home of Delphine Itongwa, a leading member of GEAD, evidently to intimidate the organization further. Various efforts to reopen the organization's offices have failed. The RCD authorities have accused GEAD of links with Mai Mai rebels opposing the RCD, but have not been able to produce any concrete evidence to support this allegation.  """"GEAD has a right to do its work freely and not be harmed,"""" said Kippenberg. """"It is unacceptable that human rights defenders are being obstructed in their work, and their organization suspended without any procedure or possibility of appeal.""""","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

Human Rights Watch warned that the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the world's highest human rights body, has reached a crisis point, with proceedings curtailed by budget cuts and dominated by abusive governments intent on blocking international scrutiny and criticism. Human Rights Watch welcomed Mr. Vieira de Mello's appointment and urged him to make it his top priority to defend the United Nations' ability to monitor and publicly censure human rights abuses around the world.  """"Mr. De Mello needs to hit the ground running, or the gains made for human rights over the past decade could easily be eroded and lost,"""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch.

Membership in the commission should be dependent on respect for human rights and cooperation with the U.N. human rights mechanisms, Human Rights Watch said, and Mr. De Mello should especially encourage those qualifications for the chairmanship of the commission.  Human Rights Watch urged Mr. Vieira de Mello to work toward making a primary qualification for chairmanship the issuance of standing invitations to all U.N. rapporteurs. The expected new chair of the commission, Libya, has not issued such invitations.  """"The outlook for the next session of the Commission is grim indeed,"""" said Weschler. """"It will be a major challenge to defend the integrity of the Commission against those who are seeking to wreck it.""""  Weschler said many governments were muting criticism of their allies in the coalition against terrorism, and even using the fight against terrorism as a pretext for abuse, cracking down on political opponents or closing their doors to refugees.  Human Rights Watch called on the new High Commissioner to prioritize the monitoring of counter-terrorist measures, to ensure they comply fully with international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch also urged the new High Commissioner for Human Rights to devote his immediate personal attention to the human rights situation in several countries, including the persistent human rights violations in China; the sharply increased political violence in Colombia; the continuing disregard by the State of Israel and armed Palestinian groups for basic human rights and humanitarian law norms; and abuses in the Chechnya region of the Russian Federation.","Global","United Nations"

Jakhangir Shosalimov, a member of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (IHROU), and Tursunbai Utamuratov, head of the Karakalpakstan section of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), were detained last week in separate incidents. Police arrested Jakhangir Shosalimov on September 4, after he had helped a journalist to interview victims of police violence in the Chorsu market in Tashkent. According to IHROU, he was then taken to the Shaikhantaurski District Court and sentenced to 15 days of detention for breaching public order.  The deputy head of the Tashkent Municipal Police reportedly told a journalist from the Institute for Peace and War Reporting that Shosalimov organized a riot that had taken place earlier that day in the Chorsu market. However, witnesses told Human Rights Watch that Shosalimov simply escorted a journalist to interview a man who claimed that police several hours earlier had beaten his pregnant wife until she lost consciousness. The man also said the police beat him as well, and that a crowd at the market had intervened.  IHROU is the only registered independent national human rights group in Uzbekistan.  “This is a clear case of the authorities trying to cover up rights abuses in the country by intimidating human rights defenders,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “The international community gave a lot of credit to the Uzbek government when it registered IHROU this past March. But the last wave of detentions has shown that registration alone is no measure of government tolerance.”  Tursunbai Utamuratov was also arrested last week in Karakalpakstan in far western Uzbekistan. According to HRSU, about thirty police officers surrounded Utamuratov’s house, arrested him, and searched his house. Family members told HRSU that police did not show a search warrant.  According to HRSU, Utamuratov is accused of tax evasion, however, the authorities have not officially informed the family of the charges against him. As of September 8, neither Utamuratov’s family members nor his attorney had been granted access to him in custody  In 1996 a court sentenced Utamuratov to five years of imprisonment on a number of trumped-up charges, brought in retribution for acting as a whistle-blower in local government when he was a civil servant. He was released after fifteen months, and then attempted to clear his name. He became a member of HRSU in 2001.  Prior to his arrest, Utamuratov issued several bulletins aimed at clearing his name of the 1995 charges.  Human Rights Watch has documented a pattern of government harassment of human rights activists in Uzbekistan that include arbitrary detention, and arrest, unfair trials, and prison terms.  At the end of August, three other human rights activists were detained. Elena Urlaeva, also a member of HRSU, was forcibly detained in a psychiatric hospital in Tashkent in what appears to be an attempt to stop her human rights activities. Two other independent human rights activists, Polina Braunberg and Iskandar Khudaiberganov, were detained twice when they attempted to help a victim of police violence to carry out a peaceful protest and then again when they attempted to hold a press conference.

In a new briefing paper that details Colombia's human rights record, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) disputed the human rights certification made on September 9 by Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage, who released an estimated $70 million in training, weapons, munitions and other supplies to a military with a record of serious human rights violations.  """"To claim that Colombia has met human rights conditions makes a mockery of the law,"""" said Eric Olson, Americas Advocacy Director for Amnesty International USA. """"The US government is papering over the dismal failure of the Colombian government to meet these minimum human rights standards. Turning a blind eye to Colombia's human rights crisis can only increase violence and undermine the aspirations of all who yearn for justice and security there.""""  Under section 567 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Appropriations Act, the Colombian government must show that its military has suspended officers credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights or to have aided and abetted paramilitary groups; cooperated with the civilian judicial authorities who prosecute soldiers in civilian courts; and taken effective measures to break ties with paramilitary groups and execute outstanding arrest warrants for paramilitary leaders.  """"Since the last certification, there have been new reports of clashes between the military and paramilitary groups,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But the fundamental problems remain the same: no serious progress toward suspending officers implicated in abuses, toward effective judicial investigations of abuses, or toward breaking the persistent links between the military and paramilitary groups.""""  The briefing paper issued by the three groups describes, using specific case examples, how none of the three conditions has been satisfied. The briefing also shows how the Colombian government's resolve to uphold human rights has sharply deteriorated since May 2002, when the previous human rights certification was granted. New President Álvaro Uribe has taken actions that threaten to further weaken accountability for human rights violations while contributing to the growth of outlawed paramilitary groups.  """"This certification is an offense to those in Colombia who are being threatened or killed for their commitment to human rights,"""" said WOLA Executive Director Bill Spencer. """"It is also an affront to the U.S. Congress, which is being strong-armed by an administration set on fighting a war in Colombia hand in hand with the worst elements of that country's military.""""  The groups also raised questions about the record of Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio, who took office in July 2001. Osorio has dismissed or forced the resignation of prosecutors in charge of sensitive human rights investigations and derailed benchmark cases, among them the prosecution of retired Gen. Rito Alejo del Río, charged with forming paramilitary groups in the 1990s. General Del Río was cashiered in 1998 and the U.S. government cancelled his visa to the United States. In a recent article published in The Wall Street Journal, Osorio was quoted accusing 45 members of the U.S. Congress of engaging in a """"war"""" to discredit the Colombian authorities, stemming from their signatures on a letter expressing concern about human rights.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

In an August 26 document that has not been released to the public, Secretary of State Colin Powell reported to the U.S. Congress that Uzbekistan is making """"substantial and continuing progress"""" in meeting the human rights and democracy commitments contained in a Joint Declaration signed with U.S. officials in March 2002. The State Department's determination was required for $45 million in additional assistance to the Uzbek government to be released, under legislation enacted by the Congress in July.  """"The State Department did not use this law as it was intended,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"We expected a proactive effort. All we got was a pro-forma report.""""  The United States has publicly expressed concern about recent setbacks in Uzbekistan, which include deaths in custody of religious prisoners and the forced psychiatric detention of a human rights defender. Yet on the basis of conversations with U.S. officials, Human Rights Watch believes that the State Department made no attempt to use the new law to leverage additional progress on those concerns before it made its positive determination.  In March 2002, a U.S.-Uzbek Joint Declaration committed Uzbekistan to ensure a """"strong and open civil society,"""" """"respect for human rights and freedoms,"""" a """"genuine multi-party system,"""" """"free and fair elections,"""" """"political pluralism, diversity of opinions and the freedom to express them,"""" """"the independence of the media"""" and """"independence of the courts.""""  In determining progress in these areas, the State Department listed a number of steps taken by Uzbekistan in response to U.S. concerns. Yet for each step cited, Uzbek authorities have adopted repressive measures that undermine its impact. For example:  The State Department cited the registration of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan, the first such group permitted to function legally in the country, and expressed hope that other groups would be legalized soon. Yet since March, no other groups have been registered and at least four human rights defenders have been arbitrarily detained. Another defender, Yuldash Rasulov, is on trial on charges relating to """"religious extremism."""" On August 28, the authorities forcibly committed yet another human rights defender, Elena Urlaeva, to a mental institution, where for the past few days she has been denied visits even from her family.  The State Department cited prison sentences handed down against seven police and security agents since January for two deaths in custody, as well as an invitation to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit Uzbekistan. But since March, Human Rights Watch has documented three new deaths arising from suspicious circumstances in custody. Two deaths, those of Muzafar Avazov and Husnidin Alimov, took place in August just prior to the State Department's positive determination. Many other deaths in custody and countless reports of torture remain uninvestigated. In May the Uzbek government failed to provide the U.N. Committee against Torture with requested statistics on the number of detainees in its facilities.  The State Department cited declining arrests of Muslims whose religious practices and affiliations fall beyond state controls. Yet the pace of arrests and trials since March indicates that the Uzbek government has not relented in its campaign to arrest and persecute such people. Between February and July, Human Rights Watch's research alone found that 116 people were convicted on charges relating to religious """"extremism,"""" and that dozens more were arrested. The State Department acknowledges there are still about 6,500 prisoners in Uzbekistan convicted on """"extremism"""" charges, most of whom were arrested and charged for their protected religious beliefs, practices, and affiliations.  The State Department cited the opposition political party Birlik's ability to hold five regional congresses since April, without government interference. But past and current members of Birlik remain on police lists and are required to report regularly to police and to sign statements explaining their current activities. Members of other banned political parties continue to be harassed and risk arbitrary detention for gathering informally or discussing political issues. Also, since March, citizens who have tried to organize protests on economic, social, and political issues have been harassed, threatened, and detained.  The State Department cited the abolition of formal prepublication censorship. But authorities apparently have transferred the role of censor from the press censor's office to newspaper editors. After running several articles that would not have been published previously, the editor of at least one newspaper was subsequently summoned by the presidential administration and pressured to stop publishing such material. Overall media content has otherwise not changed. Journalists continue to risk arbitrary detention. Last week, Uzbek police arrested human rights defender Jakhangir Shosalimov, of the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan, on doubtful charges of inciting a riot, when in fact he had helped a journalist arrange an interview with a victim of police violence.  The State Department gave credit for progress that has yet to be seen. For example, it cites judicial reforms announced last August, before the Declaration was adopted, but which remain unimplemented. Conditions on U.S. assistance to Uzbekistan, which totaled $173 million this year, are likely to be maintained by the U.S. Congress, and Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration to use them more effectively to obtain progress.  """"We recognize that in many ways American engagement on human rights in Uzbekistan has intensified since September 11, rather than ending as many feared,"""" Malinowski said. """"But that engagement won't be effective unless the Bush administration sends the message Congress intended: that continued U.S. support for the Uzbek government depends on greater responsiveness to U.S. concerns on human rights.""""","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Uzbekistan",""

We strongly suspect that this blockage is related to China's recent widespread crackdown on the free flow of information over the Internet, and to its growing pressure on foreign companies to comply with state censorship. We urge your companies to continue to resist the Chinese government´s censorship pressure as a violation of internationally recognized rights of free expression. As you know, search engines such as Google and AltaVista play a critical role in ensuring the free flow of information to millions of users in China. Chinese users who want to read objective news, and educate themselves on such restricted topics as human rights, Tibet, religion, and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, often rely on your search engines. The Chinese government blocks access to thousands of web sites based on their content. Using Google and AltaVista remains one of the best ways to circumvent this censorship, since it permits searches that may turn up restricted information in unexpected locations that have not been blocked. We suspect it is just this formidable power that attracted the attention of Chinese government censors. Google´s practice of keeping and permitting access to “cached” pages – which are accessible via Google even if direct access is blocked – may also have been a factor. Companies that do business in China have an opportunity to play a proactive role in opening space for Chinese citizens to express themselves freely. Unfortunately, Yahoo!, along with a number of Chinese internet businesses and research institutes, has voluntarily signed a public pledge on """"self-discipline"""" in China that commits the company to investigate and block websites based on their content. We believe that signatories to that pledge risk making themselves partners in violations of freedom of expression. If they are search engines, they also risk undermining the power and reputation of their product. We strongly urge Google and AltaVista to continue to resist any censorship pressure from the Chinese government. In the past, Google has resisted pressure from interest groups to censor content, and we understand that AltaVista is making an effort to ensure that Chinese users continue to have access to its site despite the recent blockage. As you continue these commendable efforts, you will have the support of nongovernmental organizations, as well as allies in the U.S. government and the broader private sector. History has shown that coordinated action can be effective in forcing the Chinese government to back off from efforts to censor the Internet. When the Chinese government tried to clamp down on the commercial use of cryptography in October 1999, coordinated efforts by various companies and trade agencies forced the Chinese government to drop the requirement that encryption codes be turned over. We see such censorship efforts as an emerging problem in China and elsewhere. We would greatly appreciate an opportunity to discuss this matter with you directly, and look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

The unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Hamid Karzai on Thursday in Kandahar is intensifying calls for such a move. Some in the Bush administration called it a """"mid-course correction,"""" but the United States appears to be on the verge of a major U-turn. For months, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz have resisted calls for an expansion of ISAF, the International Security Assistance Force, composed of 4,500 troops from 19 states and headed by Turkey. But as insecurity, factional fighting among warlords, and lawlessness have continued, it has become clear that waiting years for the formation of a credible national Afghan army and police force is not the answer. """"We do not oppose ISAF expansion"""" beyond Kabul, Wolfowitz said Thursday, while calling on the international community to take a greater role. General Tommy Franks, head of the U.S. command in Afghanistan, said there were """"a number of places that would indicate the desirability of expanding the ISAF."""" Karzai himself, the United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan, and members of the U.S. Congress in both parties have been urging expansion of the peacekeeping force. As long as security outside of Kabul is in the hands of warlords, Afghans will not be secure. And as long as the Kabul government is dependent on regional warlords, its legitimacy will be open to question. Greater security throughout the country is a prerequisite for rebuilding devastated infrastructure, encouraging the re- emergence of Afghan civil society, and establishing legal and administrative institutions to protect the rights of all Afghans. A field presence of international peacekeepers will encourage compliance with disarmament and demilitarization agreements. Factional rivalry in northern Afghanistan has led to a rise in attacks on humanitarian aid workers and Afghan civilians, threatening the delivery of urgently needed aid and resettlement assistance. Ethnic Pashtuns, a minority in the north, have been subject to targeted violence including rape, seizure of farmland, and demands for money by local commanders. Wolfowitz visited Mazar-i-Sharif in July and expressed alarm over the violence as an obstacle to development, but gave backing to the local warlords whose forces are responsible for many of the abuses in the north. Ironically, by relying on warlords and opposing an expansion of the peacekeeping force, the United States has allowed the situation to become more, not less, unstable. Other parts of the country are also plagued by violence, affecting Afghan women, ethnic minorities, and returning refugees. In several areas around Herat in the west, and Kandahar in the south, minorities have been harassed by local forces. On most roads between major cities, armed groups regularly extort money from farmers, traders and anyone not under the """"protection"""" of a regional strongman. The Bonn agreement provided for an international peacekeeping force in Kabul, but also indicated that such a force """"could, as appropriate, be progressively expanded to other urban centers and other areas."""" The UN Security Council, which renewed the peacekeepers' mandate in May, will need to vote to redefine its mandate, while seeking contributions troops, funding, and logistical support from member states to gradually increase its scope. The United States should immediately take the lead in drafting a Security Council resolution, seeking support from European governments and others on the Council. President George W. Bush, when he speaks at the United Nations on Sept. 12, should publicly endorse expansion of the peacekeeping force. Secretary of State Colin Powell should consult closely with Afghan leaders and UN officials to devise a workable strategy for increasing security. Certainly, the U.S. Congress can also help. The administration should support legislation adopted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Aug.1, authorizing $1 billion over two years for more peacekeepers, then work with Congress to get the necessary funds appropriated. During his visit to Afghanistan, Wolfowitz said that Washington is committed to Afghanistan's reconstruction, declaring that the U.S. had learned a lesson from 10 years of benign neglect. It's now up to the Bush administration to make good on that promise, not only by giving aid, but also by doing more to create the security conditions needed for a peaceful, stable Afghanistan to emerge.

Such crimes are committed routinely by both rebel and paramilitary forces in Colombia.     Although the government has not stated its reasons for rejecting the court's jurisdiction during this period, the move appears intended to bolster the government's bargaining power in eventual peace negotiations.     """"This step looks like a prelude to impunity, via some kind of amnesty law,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. """"At the moment, peace has never seemed further off, and this dispensation will only encourage more horrific abuses against civilians to occur. President Uribe can reverse the declaration at any time, and he should do so now.""""     Colombia ratified the ICC's treaty on August 5. Unbeknown to the general public, it introduced a declaration under Article 124 of the statute, a transitional provision that allows state parties to reject the court's jurisdiction for a seven-year period for crimes covered under Article 8 of the statute. Article 8, which covers war crimes, includes crimes like intentional attacks on the civilian population, hostage-taking, summary executions, torture and the recruitment of children under 15.     The Article 124 declaration was not made public at the time of Colombia's ratification, nor was it discussed in the Colombian Congress. According to a foreign ministry statement on September 2, """"Congress was aware of this possibility and presented no objection at the time."""" But Colombia's ambassador to the United Nations, Alfonso Valdivieso, admitted Congress """"probably didn't know"""" about the government's plans.     The government of President Andrés Pastrana made the declaration two days before President Uribe took office, reportedly in consultation with the new president. Another declaration the government attached to the ICC ratification stated that the government believed itself free to decree amnesties or pardons for political crimes.","Americas, Colombia, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Human Rights Watch warned against any reprisals by Indonesian security forces, noting the concern of local Papuans in the area that they may be targeted. """"In the aftermath of the attacks, Indonesia should fully comply with international human rights standards and not in any way use this terrible incident as a pretext to detain or mistreat innocent Papuans,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch's Asia Division.  On Saturday, August 31, 2002, Papua Police Chief Made Mangku Pastika confirmed that one Indonesian and two American schoolteachers had been killed after their vehicles were ambushed by a group of unknown gunmen, near Tembagapura in Indonesia's eastern most province of Papua. All three victims were employed at an international school for the children of employees of the Freeport gold mine in Papua, which is owned by U.S-based Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, Inc. Ten other individuals from the two-vehicle convoy were injured, some seriously, and were evacuated immediately for medical treatment in Townsville, Australia and Jakarta, Indonesia.  On Sunday morning government forces reported an exchange of fire with an armed group close to the scene of the ambush. The Indonesian military shot dead an unidentified Papuan male, who they suspected of being a member of the armed opposition separatist group OPM (Free Papua Movement). The Indonesian military has already publicly accused the OPM of being responsible for the attack and has launched sweeping operations to track them down. Yet National Police chief Gen. Da'I Bachtiar confirmed on Wednesday that they were as yet unable to conclude whether the perpetrators were members of the OPM.  """"There should be an immediate, impartial investigation into the attacks on unarmed civilians,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Indonesian security forces must not retaliate against local citizens, as they have done so often in the past. The United States should urge Indonesia to refrain from reprisals.""""  Because of the repeated failure of Indonesia to impartially investigate such incidents in Papua, Human Rights Watch urged Indonesia to convene a panel of independent experts to investigate the killings, including international specialists, local civilian and religious authorities and known credible human rights experts. Freeport McMoRan should fully cooperate with such an investigation. Only an independent investigation would have credibility both with local citizens and internationally.  Last November, Papuan independence leader Theys Eluay, the chairman of the Papua Presidium Council, was abducted and assassinated. Twelve members of the military's elite Special Forces branch, Kopassus, have since been charged with the killing but have yet to go to trial.  Human Rights Watch has documented serious human rights abuses in Papua, where thousands of civilians have been terrorized and many have been tortured and killed during counterinsurgency campaigns. Reported abuses have included unnecessary and often lethal use of force by Indonesian police and military forces against peaceful pro-independence demonstrators; torture and brutal beatings of detainees; ethnic and racial discrimination by government authorities; intimidation of journalists, human rights activists and others who attempt to expose abuses by the security forces; and arrest and imprisonment of Papuan leaders for nonviolent advocacy of independence.  Armed Papuan opposition groups have also been responsible for serious abuses, including attacks on security posts, with major incidents resulting in casualties in December 2000 (Abepura), February 2001 (Betaf) and June 2001 (Wasior). The OPM has never killed foreign nationals in Papua although they do have a history of kidnapping foreigners to bring attention to their cause.","Asia, Indonesia",""

This week the Belgrade authorities accepted a list of accession demands from the Council of Europe, but Human Rights Watch said the list omits important commitments in areas where Yugoslavia’s record remains poor.     Human Rights Watch detailed its concerns in a memorandum distributed to members of the Council’s Parliamentary Assembly scheduled to meet over the course of the next week, to discuss Yugoslavia’s application for admission, in advance of an expected vote on the application by the full Assembly at the end of September.     “The moment just before accession to the Council of Europe is critical for setting countries on a clear course on human rights,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “The Council will miss an important opportunity to promote reform in Yugoslavia if it leaves these gaps in its accession demands.”     The current list of Yugoslav post-accession commitments includes continued cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), but remains silent on the issue of domestic trials of war criminals not sought by the ICTY.     To date, only two war crimes trials have been held in FR Yugoslavia, although hundreds of perpetrators of war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo live in the country. The ICTY has indicated that it will focus its resources on trying the highest-ranking military and political figures, while the rest should be tried before national courts.     “There is a clear need for the Yugoslav authorities to commit to accountability for war crimes and to build the independent legal institutions capable of carrying out that goal in keeping with European fair trial standards,” said Andersen. “The Council of Europe should explicitly get behind that goal as well.”     Human Rights Watch said the list of Yugoslavia’s commitments to the Council of Europe is also incomplete when it comes to improving the performance of the police. While the list includes reference to important structural reforms of the police forces, it fails to call for     investigation and punishment of law enforcement officials who abuse their powers;   amendment to the criminal code to specifically define torture as a criminal offense, as requested by the United Nations Committee against Torture back in 1998; and   vetting procedure for all members of law enforcement structures to dismiss and, where appropriate, bring to justice those found to have committed human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations.   Human Rights Watch also expressed concern that the plight of the Roma did not make it into the list as such, despite widespread discrimination against Roma in various fields of public life and frequent reports of violence they suffer at the hands of law enforcement officials.     “These are some of the most serious human rights concerns in Yugoslavia today,” Andersen said. “They should be explicitly addressed in its Council of Europe accession documents, and should be at the top of the Council’s agenda for monitoring and technical support in Yugoslavia going forward.”","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Dr. Wan had planned to travel to Canada in September as the first recipient of a newly established human rights award. The award, to be presented by both organizations on September 13 in Montreal, recognizes “Dr. Wan’s courageous activism in combating a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in China, and efforts to protect the rights of those affected or most at risk of HIV/AIDS.”   """"Many health experts fear that the AIDS epidemic in China is developing into one of the worst in the world,” said Mickey Spiegel, senior researcher in the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “It is only through the actions of people like Dr. Wan that there is any hope of dealing forthrightly with this public health and human rights disaster. Unfortunately, his courage in speaking out against human rights abuses in China has placed him at great personal risk.”  Dr. Wan, 38, had been under heightened police surveillance and was last seen in Beijing on August 24. Friends and relatives have been unable to contact him, and police officials have not responded to requests for an investigation into his disappearance.  Since the mid-1990s, Dr. Wan has been coordinator of the AIZHI (AIDS) Action Project, a nongovernmental organization based in Beijing that provides some of the only basic information on HIV/AIDS available to people in China through a widely used Web site (www.aizhi.org). He has been instrumental in exposing a growing HIV/AIDS epidemic in China’s Henan Province, where as many as one million people may have been infected as a result of unsafe blood collection practices. In July 2002, Dr. Wan’s organization was evicted from its offices at a private university in Beijing after the university was pressured by the government to shut the organization down.  “Dr. Wan has contributed enormously to breaking the conspiracy of silence around AIDS in China,” said Richard Elliott, director of policy and research for the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network. “If he is in government custody, we urge his immediate release, and that he be allowed to travel to Canada to receive his award.”  Dr. Wan was selected earlier this summer to be the first recipient of an “Award for Action on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights,” an international award program established this year by the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network and Human Rights Watch to recognize activists who have made exceptional contributions to protecting the rights and dignity of people living with and affected by HIV/AIDS.  “We recently assisted Dr. Wan in obtaining a visa from the Canadian Embassy in Beijing in order for him to attend the awards ceremony in Montreal, and his travel arrangements have been made,” said Elliott. “We have now contacted officials at the Department of Foreign Affairs in Ottawa, asking them to make further inquiries through their office in Beijing, and we are urging the Canadian government to raise concerns about Dr. Wan’s whereabouts and well-being with the Chinese government as soon as possible.”  As a government official, Dr. Wan founded China's first AIDS hotline in 1992. A year later, he was fired from that post, as openness about HIV/AIDS and sexual minorities and their risk of contracting HIV was not welcomed by the authorities. With support from a variety of private and international sources, he has continued this work and become one of the most visible AIDS activists in the China.

About the Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network The Canadian HIV/AIDS Legal Network is a national organization engaged in education, legal and ethical analysis, and policy development. Founded in 1992, the Network’s promotes responses to HIV/AIDS that respect human rights; facilitate prevention efforts and access to care, treatment and support; minimize the adverse impact of HIV/AIDS on individuals and communities; and address the social and economic factors that increase vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and to human rights abuses. The Network is an NGO in Special Consultative Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. Its work has received national and international recognition, and the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS has included the Network’s activities in UNAIDS’ collection of “best practices.”  About Human Rights Watch Human Rights Watch is an independent, nongovernmental organization that conducts regular, systematic investigations of human rights abuses in some seventy countries around the world. Its reputation for timely, reliable disclosures has made it an essential source of information for those concerned with human rights.

Human Rights Watch called on the United States to immediately begin discussions with other members of the U.N. Security Council to approve an expansion of the peacekeeping mandate in Afghanistan.  The International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a peacekeeping force of 19 states currently under Turkish command, has been confined to providing security within Kabul. In an August 27 interview with a London newspaper (The Daily Telegraph), Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said that the U.S. would no longer oppose the expansion of ISAF to other areas in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch today confirmed with administration officials in Washington D.C. that American policy has shifted, though a decision to pro-actively seek ISAF expansion had not yet been made. """"The Bush administration has finally acknowledged that the scope of ISAF should be expanded,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But the administration should now take the lead to act."""" President Hamid Karzai and many Afghans have repeatedly called for ISAF expansion. Greater security is needed for reconstruction of the country, protection of women's rights, the safe return of refugees and the internally displaced, and to support the Bonn process, Human Rights Watch said. With ISAF limited to Kabul, the Afghan government has been heavily dependent on regional warlords to provide basic security. Human Rights Watch has noted that security conditions in many areas of Afghanistan remain dire, and serious abuses of human rights continue. There are several areas in and around the cities of Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif and Kandahar, in which criminals and local warlords have reportedly threatened and harassed the populace, particularly ethnic minorities and returning refugees and displaced persons. Human Rights Watch urged the United States and others on the U.N. Security Council to redefine ISAF's mandate to include areas deemed insecure by the U.N. mission in Afghanistan and by the Afghan government.

On Wednesday, journalist Sergei Duvanov was attacked outside his home in Almaty by unknown assailants. He suffered serious injuries, including severe head trauma and extensive cuts and bruises. The attackers reportedly said, """"you know why we're doing this"""" and """"next time we'll make you a cripple."""" There were no signs of a robbery and persons close to Duvanov were convinced that the attack was in retaliation for his recent criticism of government policies.  Duvanov was scheduled to travel to a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Warsaw next month where he had been invited to speak about human rights abuses in Kazakhstan. He received official notice of his invitation the same day as the attack.  """"Coming on the heels of Duvanov's courageous reporting and in light of the Kazakh government's general intolerance of independent media, it is difficult to dismiss this attack as a simple act of hooliganism,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch urged a prompt independent investigation and prosecution of those responsible. According to press reports, President Nazarbaev has denounced the attack on Duvanov and called for a police investigation of the incident. On the day of the attack, independent short-wave radio station """"Dat"""" (Kazakh for """"I demand a word"""") broadcast Duvanov's analysis of the political situation in Kazakhstan, including a look at the possibilities for a change in leadership for the country.  Duvanov, who also works as editor-in-chief of the """"Bulletin,"""" published by the non-governmental organization Kazakhstan International Bureau for Human Rights and Rule of Law, has consistently focused his work on justice and civil rights issues. Earlier this  year, the Kazakh government brought a case against Duvanov for his Internet postings about government attempts to silence journalists covering Swiss and U.S. investigations into alleged corruption by President Nazarbaev and family members. On July 9, 2002, officers from the national security service KNB, formerly the KGB, arrested Duvanov and informed him that a case against him had been opened for """"insulting the honor and dignity of the President,"""" under article 318 of the Kazakh Criminal Code. Duvanov was released from police custody the same day, but the case against him remains open.  """"Punishing journalists under so-called 'honor and dignity' laws is an outdated Soviet tactic that undermines the Kazakh government's claims to an open society,"""" said Andersen, """"These laws were used by the Soviets to hide abuses and criminalize dissent and President Nazarbaev is using them the same way today.""""  Other Kazakh journalists have also been physically assaulted in apparent retaliation for their reporting. Lira Baiseitova, an independent journalist who wrote for """"SolDat"""" newspaper, reported attacks in 2000 and 2001. In May 2002, Baiseitova published a controversial piece in SolDat regarding Swiss bank accounts held by the Nazarbaev family, and the following day, her 25-year old daughter """"disappeared."""" Police later informed Baiseitova that her daughter had been arrested for heroin possession. Baiseitova's daughter died in police custody and Baiseitova received conflicting reports about the cause of her death.  Also in May, employees of the """"SolDat"""" newspaper were reportedly beaten by unknown assailants and suffered severe injuries. The same month the offices of another newspaper, """"Respublika,"""" were destroyed by a firebombing. Police reportedly failed to investigate the incident. On August 16, independent television reporter Artur Platonov was physically attacked and suffered injuries requiring hospitalization.

On Tuesday, August 27, Elena Urlaeva, a member of the non-governmental organization Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, and Larissa Vdovina attended a protest outside the Ministry of Justice building against government rights abuses. Police halted the protest by arresting and detaining them, along with six other protestors. Urlaeva and Vdovina were held in the Mirza Ulugbekski district police station until Wednesday, when they were transferred to the psychiatric hospital for compulsory treatment.   Medical staff at the hospital confirmed that both women have been given psychiatric drugs since their detention. Urlaeva told Human Rights Watch that she has been given injections and tablets.  “The government is using old Soviet tactics in an attempt to silence Urlaeva and make her stop her human rights activities,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch.  In 2001, Urlaeva was forcibly detained in psychiatric detention for over two months under circumstances that raised serious concerns that she was being targeted for her human rights activities. Since her release last year, she has continued to actively defend victims of human rights abuse. On June 5, a Tashkent court ruled that Urlaeva should again be subjected to forced treatment in a psychiatric hospital, but the authorities only executed the decision on August 27.  Urlaeva attended the August 27 protest in order to demand that the court decision be overturned. Vdovina was protesting her illegal dismissal from work and the failure of the courts to uphold her legal rights. Olga Krasnova, another protest participant who was detained, told Human Rights Watch that local authorities beat her in police detention. She said that she was held for 10 hours at the Yunosobadski police station and then released. A Human Rights Watch researcher observed bruising on her arms, back and legs.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Syria´s state security court found the activists guilty of “attempting to change the constitution by illegal means,” “spreading false information,” and other vaguely worded political charges and sentenced them to two to 10 years in prison. On August 28, the court handed down judgments to the last three defendants, sentencing engineer Fawaz Tello to five years in prison, physician Kamal Labwani to three years, and teacher Hassan Saadun to two years. “The European Union does a lot of business with Syria, and it has a responsibility to respond to a human rights crisis of this magnitude,” said Lotte Leicht, Brussels director of Human Rights Watch. “The criminal prosecution of these activists was a blatant violation of their right to freedom of expression. The European Union, and especially France among the member states, should raise their cases with Syrian authorities and campaign for their release.” The European Union is Syria´s main trading partner, with some 55 percent of Syria´s exports going to EU member states. The roundup of the activists began in August 2001, with the arrest of independent member of parliament Mamoun al-Homsi. Nine others were arrested in September 2001, including outspoken parliamentarian Riad al-Seif and 72-year old lawyer Riad al-Turk, a veteran political activist who was imprisoned without charge and held incommunicado from 1981 to 1998. Homsi and Seif were tried in the Damascus criminal court and sentenced earlier this year to five years in prison. Turk was prosecuted in the state security court and sentenced to two and a half years in June. The remaining seven defendants—all of whom were active in the country´s popular independent civic forums and human rights organizations—were tried in the security court. Lawyer Habib Issa received a five-year sentence on August 19, economist and university professor Aref Dalila was sentenced to 10 years, and physician Dr. Walid al-Bunni to five years, on July 31. Businessman Habib Saleh was sentenced to three years in June. The security court´s procedures do not meet international fair-trial standards and its decisions cannot be appealed. “You´re a doctor, so learn to go to your clinic and not interfere in politics,” one of the court´s judges told Kamal Labwani, according to the BBC. Syria and the European Union have close relations. Syria has received grants from the European Commission and loans from European Investment Bank to support economic infrastructure projects. According to the Delegation of the European Commission in Syria, seven Financing Agreements for specific projects have been concluded since 2000. The European Union has also been negotiating an Association Agreement with Syria since May 1998, with the most recent session in Damascus in June 2002. The Association Agreements stipulate that relations between the parties “shall be based on respect of democratic principles and fundamental human rights as set out in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, which guides their internal and international policy and constitutes an essential element of [the agreements].” “The European Union has contacts and leverage with the Syrian government on many levels,” said Leicht. “It should not ignore the harsh sentences of these political reformers and human rights activists.” Leicht said the European Union, at all levels, should be pressing for the prisoners´ unconditional release, and the release of others imprisoned in Syria solely for expression of their opinions and peaceful civic or political activity.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Syria",""

Earlier this month, an appellate Sharia court in northern Nigeria upheld a stoning sentence against a 30-year old woman for having sex outside marriage. A Sharia (Islamic law) court sentenced Ado Baranda to death by stoning in May after finding him guilty of raping a nine-year old girl. The defendant, who is in his fifties, reportedly pleaded guilty and declined the opportunity to appeal.  “The reason for his decision not to appeal has not been confirmed, but on the basis of past experience, we are concerned the trial may not have been fair,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. “The absence of fair trial process is especially worrying when death sentences are handed down.” Previous trials in Sharia courts in several northern states of Nigeria have been characterized by an absence of due process. Defendants do not always have legal representation; they are often ill-informed about procedures and about their rights. Judges and other court officials frequently lack legal training.  In January 2002, for the first time since Sharia was extended to cover criminal cases, a man was sentenced to death and executed. In the trial, the defendant did not have legal representation and did not take up the opportunity to appeal.  A spokesman for the Jigawa state government was quoted on August 27 in the Nigerian newspaper ThisDay and in Agence France Presse (AFP) as saying, “In Sharia there is no compromise. The only compromise is if someone should appeal.” The government spokesman reportedly also stated that the governor of Jigawa would not intervene in the case of Ado Baranda.  Human Rights Watch called on Nigeria’s federal government to abolish the death penalty in Nigeria and ban cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments such as stoning. Despite statements from senior government officials, including President Olusegun Obasanjo and Minister of Justice Kanu Agabi, opposing such punishments and declaring them unconstitutional, the federal government has yet to prove its willingness to act.  Human Rights Watch is opposed to the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherently cruel and irreversible nature.  “We deplore the crime of which this defendant is accused, and anyone found guilty of rape should receive a heavy sentence. However, taking another person’s life in the name of justice is not an appropriate punishment, especially when the fairness of the trial may be in doubt,” said Takirambudde.","Africa, Nigeria","Religious Freedom"

The New York-based group criticized the Serbian government’s passivity in the face of repeated attempts by extreme nationalists to disrupt an exhibition of war photographs by American artist Ron Haviv, organized by local activists. The exhibition mostly consists of photographs documenting war crimes in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo.  “By failing to respond to this kind of harassment, the authorities essentially condone it,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “The problem stems from the government’s reluctance to seriously confront the issue of war crimes against non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. Those who wish to talk or learn about the crimes face intimidation, and the government tacitly consents.”  In the latest incident on August 25, 2002, supporters of former Bosnian Serb leader and war crime indictee Radovan Karadzic prevented an opening of the exhibition in the central Serbian city of Kragujevac. The protesters shouted nationalist slogans and insulted visitors, leading exhibition organizers to suspend the opening. The incident in Kragujevac follows similar events in the towns of Uzice and Cacak. Ron Haviv’s exhibition in Uzice closed on June 5, 2002, five days ahead of schedule, when a group of nationalists took photos off the wall as the police stood idly by. In Cacak, on July 15, protesters physically attacked one of the organizers and injured his head; the organizers were forced to move the exhibition from the city’s Cultural Center to a smaller, less suitable space.  Serbian law prohibits and provides for punishment for disruption of the public peace, as well as physical attacks. To date, the Serb authorities have failed to denounce the nationalist actions or launch any investigations into possible criminal responsibility for the incidents. The government has also failed to react to threats received by human rights activists campaigning for public debate on war crimes. In a statement published in Belgrade newspapers on August 11, 2002, an association of Serb nationalists threatened that “in order to prevent the anti-Serb activities of the non-governmental organizations, [the association of Serb nationalists] will use all permissible civilized means, and, if necessary, those that are not.” The statement singled out Natasa Kandic, director of the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center, and also referred to other individuals involved in the campaign.  “The extremists have free rein, because the government stands aside and does not respond,” said Andersen. She said the government’s dismal record in domestic war crimes trials, and its half-hearted efforts to cooperate with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), made it clear why Serbian nationalists feel free to intimidate those who seek debate on war crimes.  Since the fall of former President Slobodan Milosevic in October 2000, Yugoslavia’s domestic courts have convicted only one person on war crimes charges.  The new authorities in Belgrade have transferred five ICTY indictees to the custody of the Hague tribunal; eight more indictees have surrendered voluntarily. Human Rights Watch attributes the government’s limited cooperation with the ICTY to international pressure, rather than a genuine commitment by Serb officials to uphold human rights and the rule of law. Seventeen indictees are believed still to be at large within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

On August 26, the WPA adopted a plan to have the group's executive committee determine members of a team to visit China to assess evidence that political and religious dissidents, labor activists and others are being detained in psychiatric institutions. The WPA team hopes to visit China and report back by May 2003. Human Rights Watch had urged the WPA to adopt a strong resolution calling on China to cease psychiatric abuses and to fully cooperate with a WPA investigation, and warning that China's WPA membership was at stake if it did not adopt effective remedies.  """"The WPA must play hardball in its talks with China on the terms of the mission,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"A truly independent investigation would clearly be useful, but it can't be used by Beijing as a smoke screen for the abuses to continue."""" Human Rights Watch said the effectiveness of the WPA's limited action would depend upon the composition of the working party, whether China would have any say in its composition, and whether its members would have complete, confidential and unrestricted access to psychiatric facilities and detainees. The Yokohama delegation representing Britain's Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) had proposed that the WPA stand by the organization's Madrid Declaration of 1996 that prohibits a diagnosis of mental illness based on political or religious belief. But its motion that would have gone further in ensuring a completely independent mission was defeated. It abstained from the vote out of concern over the makeup of the mission. """"The prospects of getting unrestricted access to Chinese mental hospitals would be greater if the WPA had clearly indicated China risked losing its WPA membership if it didn't fully cooperate,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. According to """"Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and its Origins in the Mao Era,"""" a recent report by Human Rights Watch and the Geneva Initiative of Psychiatry, China's use of psychiatric imprisonment goes back to the beginnings of the People's Republic. Although there had been a steady decline in numbers of commitments to police-run mental asylums throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, the numbers rose again after the crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual group in July 1999.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

For the first time, crimes against humanity can be punished and prosecuted in a single world court. Next Tuesday sees the launch session at the UN of the new international criminal court. The signatories to the ICC (77 and rising) will begin selecting judges before the court itself opens for business early next year. In many respects, celebrations are justified. Britain could, however, yet share responsibility for the celebrations turning sour. The good news is clear. The birth of the court, on July 1, was against heavy odds: many sceptics had been confident that a tribunal with worldwide jurisdiction over atrocities and genocide could never come into being. """"Never again"""", the pious phrase that was heard so often after 1945, had come to seem a vile lie. Never again what?, Cambodians, Rwandans and others could reasonably ask. Now, for the first time in history, a single institution exists which can bring the Pol Pots and Pinochets to justice. Britain's role in this remarkable saga has, in part, been admirable. Tony Blair's personal commitment made a real difference in the battles that led up to the signing four years ago of the Rome treaty, which paved the way for the court. But there are worrying signs that this early resolve is becoming increasingly shaky in the face of American intransigence. Washington says it fears US citizens will be unfairly targeted. In reality - as Cherie Blair has pointed out, more explicitly than her husband dares to - the Americans are wrong to fear malicious prosecutions of their soldiers or other US citizens. Checks and balances will ensure that frivolous cases never get to court. So far, US pressure has not been successful, despite constant attempts to create artificial deadlines. Last month, Washington threatened to sabotage the Bosnian peacekeeping operation unless American citizens were offered special immunity from justice. Despite fissures among supporters of the court, the US backed down somewhat from its ultimate demands. Washington, however, has not given up. It now arm-twists east European countries to do its bidding - including a threat that the Nato door will be slammed in their faces unless they comply with American demands. The US wants its citizens to be granted impunity for all time. This absurd demand would damage not just the court, but America itself, which can have no interest in creating new enemies. Washington has demanded that Belgrade renounce the terms of the treaty affecting US citizens, while pressing the Serbs to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in the Hague. The Serbs are not alone in scenting rank hypocrisy. European foreign ministers meeting in Elsinore this week will discuss how strongly to oppose US pressures; the European commission has already rebuked Romania for caving in. A large dose of Hamletian indecision is likely at Elsinore, but internal battle lines are forming. Everybody claims to be in favour of the ICC: that is the easy part. European governments are, however, worried that things are going badly wrong, and that London is at the heart of it. Tony Blair stands accused of playing a divisive role in his eagerness not to offend George Bush. British officials have told European counterparts that they oppose any attempt at a coordinated rejection of American demands - just as they did in July when they lined up with the US during a crucial security council debate. The British insist that they are looking for a compromise which will save the day, while other Europeans indulge in comfortable criticism. This dismissive attitude is alarm ingly reminiscent of the pragmatism that Douglas Hurd liked to boast of when he was foreign secretary and messing up the Balkans. I remember his insistence on the need for compromise ahead of a 1992 peace conference on Yugoslavia - a conference which paved the way for the worst horrors. When I interviewed Slobodan Milosevic in his Knightsbridge hotel a few days later, the Serb leader was clearly delighted to have been let off the hook. Hurd's determination to make accommodations at any cost represented moral abdication on a grand scale. It would be disastrous if Blair and Jack Straw followed in the shabby footsteps of John Major and Hurd in negotiating a """"compromise"""" which undermined the prospects for lasting justice. Blair and Straw are in danger of trying so hard to please the White House that they poison the international court. Two-tier justice is no justice at all. One day, Americans must understand that. In the meantime, Tony Blair must not allow himself to become George Bush's partner in weakening European resolve, thus damaging the court that the prime minister himself helped to create.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, United Kingdom",""

Foreign Ministers on August 30-31, we are writing you about the most recent Bush Administration attack on the International Criminal Court (ICC). As you know, Washington is applying intense pressure on European Union Member States as well as E.U. Candidate States to sign what it claims are """"Article 98 agreements."""" These bilateral agreements, referring to Article 98(2) of the ICC Treaty, would require a signatory European Union Member State to send any American national sought by the Court to the United States instead of surrendering him or her to the ICC.    Washington's latest attack comes at what should be a moment of celebration. In early September, the ICC's historic first Assembly of States Parties will convene at the United Nations headquarters in New York. Nearly eighty states have ratified the Rome Statute, including, most recently, Colombia. Many more signatory states will ratify before November 30 in order to participate in the election of judges and the prosecutor. The Court's """"Advance Team"""" is at work in The Hague creating the technical and administrative infrastructure the Court will need to open in 2003. The International Criminal Court is a tremendous achievement for which your government, as a founding State Party and the European Union as a whole, deserves much credit.   However, the U.S. government is determined to continue obstructing the Court. Having failed during the U.N. Security Council debate in July to secure an iron-clad exemption from the Court's jurisdiction for U.S. personnel, the Bush Administration is determined to prevent the European Union from adopting a coordinated position rejecting these agreements. In the last week the Bush Administration has explicitly warned European Union governments not to challenge U.S. pressure on E.U. Candidate States and not to formulate a coordinated rejection of Washington's purported """"Article 98 agreements."""" We believe this unprecedented diplomatic overreaching is due to Washington's alarm that the E.U.'s Common Foreign and Security Policy, tracking the Common Position on the ICC, will define itself in support of the Court and in opposition to the requested Article 98(2) agreements with the U.S..   For the legal and policy reasons explained below, Human Rights Watch urges your government to:   (1) At the upcoming Informal Meeting of Foreign Ministers in Denmark, support the adoption of a coordinated European Union rejection of U.S. demands to enter into the purported """" Article 98 agreements.""""   (2) At a minimum, at the Meeting insist on deferring the adoption of a coordinated position on these agreements until there has been sufficient time analyze and debate fully its legal implications. This is all the more essential in light of the E.U.'s Common Position on the International Criminal Court.   (3) At the upcoming OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting and the General Debate at the United Nations Fifty-Seventh General Assembly articulate the importance your government attaches to the ICC.   Article 98 Agreements   Human Rights Watch believes ICC States Parties and signatory states have a legal obligation that prevents them from entering into Article 98 agreements with non-State Parties, particularly the United States, the only country to have officially repudiated the Rome Statute.   Article 98 was included in the Rome Statute to provide an orderly and rational process for the handling of suspects among states cooperating with the Court. It was not intended to allow a state that has refused to cooperate with the Court to negotiate a web of agreements to secure exemption for its citizens or otherwise undermine the effective functioning of the Court. Signing such an agreement with the United States, given its current policy of non-cooperation with the Court, would contravene the obligations that governments undertook upon signing or ratifying the Rome Statute.   In this context it is important to recall Article 98's negotiating history. The provision was inserted into the Rome Statute on the insistence of the United States at the Rome Diplomatic Conference. U.S. negotiators argued that Article 98 would increase Washington's """"comfort level"""" with the Court and keep the U.S. engaged in the ICC process. States agreed to include Article 98 on this basis. Given the Rome Statute's preference for good-faith national investigations and prosecutions, this rule made some sense: governments could have """"first crack"""" at any of their nationals who were suspects, on the understanding that the suspect would be surrendered to the ICC if the Court found that national proceedings were not conducted in good faith. However, in light of the U.S. government's repudiation of the Court, Washington has eliminated the underlying rationale for any Article 98 agreement with the United States, since the Bush Administration would refuse to surrender an American suspect to the ICC even if the Court found the U.S. investigation or prosecution to have been a complete sham. Thus, your government and the E.U. would be justified in refusing to enter into such agreements with the United States.   To elaborate our legal views:   (1) Article 98 must be construed narrowly and consistently with the jurisdictional regime in the Rome Statute, which is based on the nationality of the accused or the state where the crimes occurred.   (2) Article 98 does not override the requirement that national prosecutions for Rome Statute crimes be subject to ICC scrutiny to determine whether investigations and prosecutions are conducted in good faith.   (3) States Parties and signatories of the Rome Statute are legally required to ensure that these basic and important aspects of the Rome Statute are not violated: States Parties by virtue of their legal obligations in the Rome Statute to cooperate with the ICC; signatories of the Rome Statute by virtue of their legal obligations under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to """"refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose"""" of the Rome Statute.   (4) Article 98 permits a State Party to enter into jurisdictional-routing agreements with another State Party that allows it first chance at investigating and prosecuting. Such agreements are technically consistent with the complementarity principle in the Rome Statute, although Human Rights Watch discourages States Parties from entering into them with other State Parties.   (5) Article 98 does not permit a non-State Party (and particularly one that has repudiated the Rome Statute) to effectively provide immunity from the ICC's jurisdiction and to obstruct the efforts of the ICC either to prosecute the most serious international crimes or to ensure that good faith national prosecutions occur.   (6) States Parties and signatories of the Rome Statute should not sign an agreement providing immunity from ICC prosecution with a country that has repudiated or has not signed the Rome Statute - to do so would undermine the """"object and purpose"""" of the treaty.   (7) Agreements (""""Article 98"""" agreements or Status-of-Forces Agreements) that purport to require States Parties and signatories of the Rome Statute to turn over military personnel suspected of committing crimes within the ICC's jurisdiction to a country that has repudiated or has not signed the Rome Statute are thus not valid.   Beyond the legal arguments, Human Rights Watch urges the European Union to reject Article 98 agreements for important policy reasons. The effective widespread exemption of a certain class of persons - U.S. nationals - from the jurisdiction of the Court would cause a serious breach in the regime of international criminal responsibility envisioned by the Rome Statute. The exemption could also serve as a dangerous precedent to encourage other states to seek similar immunity for their citizens. This would undermine the effectiveness and credibility of the Court.   If the E.U. is unable to agree on a coordinated rejection of the U.S. demand for a purported Article 98 agreement, we urge you to defer the matter for at least several months to allow time to fully consider the implications of the European Union's Common Position on the International Criminal Court in light of the complex legal and policy issues involved. In reality, the Court will not be able to request the surrender of anyone for at least a year, so it is unreasonable to demand the European Union Member States be rushed into negotiations or cease a """"go slow"""" approach.   Before and since the Rome Diplomatic Conference, the E.U. has provided vital leadership in building the Court, an institution we believe has the potential to be the most important human rights mechanism created in fifty years. We know ICC States Parties worldwide are looking to the European Union to provide leadership here in a manner consistent with its Common Position on the Court. To falter now would not only forfeit that leadership role but would also damage the E.U.'s Common Foreign and Security Policy. Ironically, capitulation to this pressure would also embolden the most unlilateralist actors within the Bush Administration.   The General Debate at the United Nations General Assembly    Human Rights Watch urges your government to include a strong reference to the ICC in your intervention at the forthcoming General Debate at the United Nations Fifty-Seventh General Assembly. In the last two years, the General Debate has provided a valuable forum for states to highlight the importance they attach to the ICC. This is the first General Assembly General Debate since the entry into force of the Rome Statute on July 1, 2002. It is also the first session since the Bush Administration's unprecedented """"unsigning"""" of the Rome Statute and its attacks on the Court. For these reasons, we believe the General Debate presents an especially appropriate moment to celebrate the Court's coming into being. Strong statements of support will track the many positive interventions made during the extraordinary plenary session of the ICC Preparatory Commission on July 3 as well as the statements made at the open meeting of the U.N. Security Council on July 10. We urge you to include a strongly worded statement of support at the forthcoming General Assembly to help underscore the breadth and depth of support for the ICC.   Human Rights Watch appreciates your government's contributions to the establishment of the International Criminal Court. We are confident that you as an E.U.

The paper details the arbitrary arrest, unfair trials and torture of hundreds of independent Muslims in Uzbekistan since October 2001, the last time the administration scrutinized that country's record on religious freedom. Turkmenistan, one of the most repressive countries in the world, in 1997 outlawed all religions except Sunni Islam and Russian Orthodoxy.  In its letter to Powell, Human Rights Watch said that designating both countries would help reverse perceptions that the United States is unwilling to take to task its allies in the war against terrorism for serious human rights abuses.  """"These are two very repressive governments with appalling records on religious persecution,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The U.S. administration cannot duck those facts.""""  Andersen said that failing to designate Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan as countries of particular concern would call into question the Bush administration's commitment to religious freedom. """"If Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are not trampling on religious freedoms, then who is?"""" said Andersen. """"This whole process of evaluating religious freedom will be seen as a completely cynical exercise unless the U.S. administration does the right thing on these two countries.""""  Among the groups most affected by the Turkmen government's draconian restrictions on religion are Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists, Adventists and Hare Krishnas. Islamic groups also suffer state harassment. Last year, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended that the administration designate Turkmenistan a country of particular concern.  """"Turkmenistan is a bastion of tyranny,"""" said Andersen. """"The administration's failure last year to act on the Commission's recommendation was disgraceful.""""  The Human Rights Watch briefing paper on Uzbekistan documents 116 convictions of religious prisoners on charges based on their membership in unregistered religious organizations, possession or distribution of """"extremist"""" literature, and meeting for private prayer or Islamic study. Many other detainees are believed to be awaiting trial. Police beat and torture prisoners to coerce testimony. After conviction, prison officials frequently torture religious inmates and compel them daily to renounce their faith and ask the state's forgiveness.  Earlier this month, two religious prisoners, Muzafar Avazov and Husnidin Alimov, died in custody under ghastly circumstances that strongly indicated they had been tortured. A third, Husnidin Hikmatov, died at home in May two days after he was released because of injuries he sustained apparently from torture. He had been serving a 17-year sentence on """"extremism"""" charges. A letter smuggled out of an Uzbek prison, described in the briefing paper, details some of the harrowing torture, including sexual assault, that religious prisoners suffer.  Last year, hundreds of religious prisoners-a small proportion of Uzbekistan's estimated thousands-were amnestied, but faced harassment and rearrest after their release.  """"This year the Uzbek government has been utterly unrelenting in its arrest campaign,"""" said Andersen. """"And it is trying to persuade others that it's all part of the global campaign against terrorism. But in fact, it is undermining the Bush administration's principle that the war against terrorism not be a war against Islam.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan","Religious Freedom"

But it has done little to expose and condemn the ways some states are using radical interpretations of Islamic law, or Shariah, to subordinate and exclude women. The U.S. should be equally concerned about the consequences of these interpretations on Muslims as well as non-Muslims. Just this week, an appellate Shariah court in northern Nigeria upheld a """"death by stoning"""" sentence against a woman for having sex outside marriage. The case of Amina Lawal, the 30-year-old Nigerian woman sentenced to death, should raise grave concerns about how Islamic law is used in Nigeria and in other countries to brutalize and subordinate women. No country that values human dignity and the equality of all its citizens can afford to have a legal system in place that endorses discrimination, torture, and cruel and inhuman punishment. Immediate reform of the aspects of Shariah that deny women equality under law and in practice is needed. Combined with local traditions, the effect of such verdicts is to make women afraid. A public sentencing sends a message to all women: that if they step outside the strictures of Shariah, they, too, can expect a painful and ignominious death. If she loses her final appeal, Ms. Lawal can expect to be buried up to her chest and stoned to death, leaving behind three motherless children. But countless other women in Nigeria will fear for their own lives as a result. Shariah need not be bad for women. Throughout the world, Muslim women want to live observant lives with human dignity and respect for their rights. Many Muslim women I know and work with are faithful Muslims and categorically reject the abuse of Shariah to sow their oppression. In Saudi Arabia in March, at least 14 girls may have died unnecessarily in a school fire because of extreme interpretations of the Islamic dress code. Members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice interfered with rescue efforts because the fleeing students were not wearing the obligatory public attire (long black cloaks and head coverings) for Saudi girls and women. Also in Saudi Arabia, women's testimonies in court are equal to half those of a man. A woman in Pakistan who has been raped and wants the state to prosecute her case must have four Muslim men testify that they witnessed the assault. Absent these male witnesses, effectively the rape victim has no case. Equally alarming, if she cannot prove the rape allegation, she runs a very high risk of being charged with fornication or adultery, the criminal penalty for which is either a long prison sentence, including public whipping, or, though rarely, death by stoning. The application of Shariah is not limited to criminal matters, but in some countries some aspects of Shariah also govern civil matters. Morocco's """"personal status code"""" (the Mudawwana) is one example. Under it, women are treated as legal minors and denied legal autonomy to conclude their own marriage contracts. This code establishes male authority over female family members, requires women to obey their husbands in all matters, and sharply limits women's -- though not men's -- access to divorce. Moroccan law further discriminates against women in the marriage process by allowing men to have up to four wives simultaneously. There will no doubt be significant and vigorous disagreement about whether the above examples are faithful interpretations and applications of Shariah. While this is being debated, millions of women living under Shariah contend with laws and practice that make a mockery of international human rights protections and endanger their lives. There are varying interpretations among Islamic jurists about whether these applications are correct, but they are grossly unfair to women, antithetical to human-rights principles, and should be reformed. How do we protect vulnerable women in countries like Nigeria where a radical interpretation of Shariah is being enforced? The international community must pressure governments to reform criminal laws and strengthen secular justice systems so that the rule of law applies across society. Civil societies must be strengthened, and local women's groups that are pushing for reform should be supported. The U.N., European Union, and other multilateral bodies should redouble their efforts to support long-term projects that improve women's legal and other status. The U.S. identified the restoration of Afghan women's basic rights as one of the principal goals of ousting the Taliban. This must be a goal not only for Afghanistan, but also for the other parts of the world where the growing power of discriminatory law, including certain interpretations of Shariah, is a pernicious and chronic threat to women's very existence.","United States, Global","Women's Rights"

The legal system is being used to punish adult women for consensual sex,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The death penalty is never an appropriate punishment for a crime, and, in this instance, the very nature of the crime is in doubt.""""  In March 2002, a Sharia court in the state of Katsina in northern Nigeria had sentenced 30-year old Amina Lawal to death for having engaged in sex outside marriage. The government used her pregnancy as evidence of her having committed adultery. Ms. Lawal now has an eight-month old child.  Over the past year, some northern Nigerian states have increasingly applied Sharia law to criminal cases, among them theft and adultery. Consequently, Nigerian Sharia courts have ordered amputations as punishment for theft and death penalty by stoning for adultery cases. To date, no stoning sentence has been carried out.  Jefferson urged the Nigerian government to commute the death sentence of Amina Lawal and drop the criminal charges against her.  Human Rights Watch, which opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty, also urged Nigeria to end the death penalty and the prosecution of consensual sex between adults.","Africa, Nigeria","Women's Rights"

The report finds the rebels responsible for widespread killings, summary executions, rapes, and pillage during the put-down of a mutiny beginning on May 14, 2002. """"The commanders responsible for these war crimes should be promptly arrested and prosecuted,"""" said Suliman Baldo, senior researcher in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.     Baldo welcomed the recent signing of a peace accord by Congolese President Kabila and Rwandan President Kagame. The agreement called for the disarming of the former Rwandan Armed Forces (ex-FAR) and Interahamwe militia in Congo implicated in Rwanda's 1994 genocide, and a withdrawal of Rwandan forces from Congo.     However, Human Rights Watch said that war crimes and crimes against humanity continue to be committed daily by all parties to the war in the Congo, including the Rwandan army and its proxy force, the RCD-Goma.     """"Impunity plagues the Great Lakes region, and until the belligerents and the international community show resolve in uprooting it, innocent civilians will continue to be massacred by lawless forces,"""" said Baldo.     The 30-page report, titled """"War Crimes in Kisangani: The Response of Rwandan-backed Rebels to the May 2002 Mutiny,"""" is based on a three-week research trip to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Human Rights Watch research team established that Congolese military and police elements attempted a mutiny against Rwandan elements within RCD-Goma in Kisangani on May 14, briefly occupying the local radio station and killing several persons believed to be Rwandans.     The attempted mutiny soon ended, but RCD-Goma flew in from Goma the top commanders of its army to coordinate a brutal repression campaign afterwards. Human Rights Watch research documented the killing of dozens of civilians in the Mangobo area of Kisangani in the course of the repression, as well as numerous rapes, beatings, and widespread looting.     In addition, the loyalist RCD-Goma elements executed a large number of detained police and military personnel, many of them at the Tshopo Bridge, and threw their mutilated bodies in the river. Many of the bodies later resurfaced. Human Rights Watch also documented killings at other locations, including an abandoned brewery, the military barracks at Camp Ketele and at the Mangobo airport. A final death toll remains to be determined, but Human Rights Watch established that at least 80 persons, and probably many more, died during the mutiny and the repression that followed.     Directly implicated in the killings were: Gabriel Amisi, also known as Tango Fort, the assistant chief of staff for logistics of the RCD-Goma army; Bernard Biamungu, commander of the Fifth Brigade headquartered in Goma; Laurent Nkunda, the commander of the Seventh Brigade based in Kisangani, and other senior officers of the Fifth and Seventh Brigades. Biamungu was seen giving commands to soldiers to go to Mangobo soon before civilians began to be killed there, and was personally at the scene of some of the killings. Biamungu, Amisi, and Nkunda were all seen at the Tshopo Bridge shortly before summary executions took place there on the night of the 14th.     Human Rights Watch questioned whether the U.N. Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) failed to carry out its mandate to protect civilians """"under imminent threat of physical violence."""" The U.N. Mission had more than a thousand soldiers in Kisangani and were clearly aware of the killings.     However, Human Rights Watch commended the detailed investigation into the Kisangani events by MONUC and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights that contributed to the establishment of an accurate record of the abuses. The Security Council in July issued a strong call for accountability for the killings.     """"We welcome the U.N. Security Council's call for accountability in Kisangani,"""" said Baldo.

U.N. human rights bodies have in recent years expressed serious concerns about human rights in Libya, including: - extrajudicial and summary executions perpetrated by state agents; - a high incidence of arbitrary arrest and long-term detention without trial; - the systematic use of torture and other ill-treatment or punishment; - imposition of the death penalty for offences that cannot be characterized as the most serious, including political and economic offences; - lack of judicial independence; - continuing inequality between women and men in such areas as inheritance, freedom of movement, nationality and divorce; - numerous restrictions in law and practice on freedom of expression and, in particular, the right to express opposition or criticism of the government.  Human Rights Watch has called on the leadership of the newly constituted African Union to make sure that the government that will be leading the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the world's chief human rights body, had a strong track record on human rights, was prepared to safeguard against any attempts to weaken the international human rights system, and was willing to cooperate with all U.N. human rights monitoring mechanisms. Libya should begin by issuing an open invitation to the U.N. human rights mechanisms to visit the country.

The ad hoc human rights court for East Timor convicted former East Timor governor Abilio Osorio Soares of crimes against humanity and sentenced him to three years imprisonment on August 14, 2002. Soares had been implicated in the attacks on an independence leader's house in April 1999 and the Suai church massacre in September 1999. """"The court's action is a mockery of justice. The sentence amounts to little more than a slap on the wrist,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Asia for Human Rights Watch. """"This signals that Indonesia is not serious about holding the worst abusers accountable."""" The prosecutor had asked the court to sentence Soares to 10 and one-half years, just over the minimum. The maximum penalty possible was death. Verdicts for several other defendants are expected soon, including those for former police commander of East Timor Brig. General Timbul Silaen and two lieutenant colonels implicated in the Suai massacre. """"The next verdicts are the ones to watch,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Almost any guilty verdict will seem tougher by comparison, giving the false impression that justice has been done."""" Human Rights Watch previously expressed concern over legal loopholes that threatened to undermine the effectiveness and comprehensiveness of the Indonesian judicial process in the East Timor cases.  Judges did not allow the trials to be derailed by a constitutional amendment banning retroactive application of laws, as many feared. But the trials were still hindered by a definition of crimes against humanity that limited command responsibility for the actions of subordinates, and by a presidential decision limiting the mandate for the tribunal to a handful of cases that occurred in April 1999 and after the referendum of August 30, 1999.  The indictments portray the 1999 violence in East Timor as a civil disturbance rather than a systematic and widespread terror campaign, thereby ensuring from the outset that the establishment of cases of crimes against humanity would be much more difficult. The role of the military and Indonesian officials in organizing and arming militia groups and in orchestrating the violence has never been fully revealed in court. Only four East Timorese witnesses testified in Jakarta and at least one of these has alleged intimidation. Many indicted suspects have not even been detained. """"The entire process is deeply flawed,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. After the verdict, Soares said he would appeal, repeating his claim that he could not have prevented well-armed groups from acting in a """"horizontal conflict."""" According to Indonesian press accounts, he also said that """"many orders came right from the center and did not involve the province."""" """"The conduct of the trials thus far undermines the Bush administration's claim that expanded U.S. cooperation with the Indonesian military is now justified and will benefit human rights,"""" Jendrzejczyk said. """"We're a long way from seeing any serious accountability.""""

The military officer, discovered in Angola among a number of demobilized rebels of National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), will be transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) for prosecution. During the genocide, soldiers and national policemen under Bizimungu’s command directed the massacre of tens of thousands of Tutsi civilians who had taken refuge in churches, hospitals and schools. Soldiers and policemen also ordered civilian officials and ordinary citizens to join in hunting down and killing the Tutsi and punished them if they failed to do so.  “Delivering justice for a genocide is a slow and enormous undertaking,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “That was true for the Holocaust and it is true for Rwanda. What’s important is to persist — both in tracking the accused and in ensuring their prosecution.”  Commenting on the conflict between the current Rwandan government and the ICTR, which has blocked the work of the tribunal, Des Forges said, “It’s essential for the U.N. Security Council to resolve this issue. There’s no point in arresting people unless you know you can bring them to trial.”  As a relatively young military officer, Augustin Bizimungu was proposed as chief of staff by Col. Theoneste Bagosora, a major decision-maker in Rwandan military circles at the start of the genocide. Initially rejected by other officers, Bizimungu was subsequently named to replace another officer who was deemed not rigorous enough in exterminating the Tutsi minority.  Col. Bagosora is also in the hands of the ICTR and will be tried in early September.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"

It is becoming hard to square that commitment with the Bush administration's strange and single-minded crusade against the International Criminal Court. Supporters and critics of the ICC ought to agree on one thing: The fate of the world is not at stake in the debate over this institution. Yet the administration's obsession with the remote possibility of the ICC's pursuing an American has begun to trump its pursuit of virtually every other important national interest. In July the administration promised to shut down every United Nations peacekeeping mission in the world if the U.N. Security Council didn't grant American peacekeepers permanent immunity from the ICC. The total number of American military personnel serving today as U.N. peacekeepers is -- hold your breath -- one. (Several dozen Americans also serve the United Nations as military observers and several hundred as police monitors, but all are unarmed and therefore hardly likely to be accused of war crimes). Yet for this the administration was willing to risk operations vital to peace and stability from Lebanon to Cyprus to Bosnia. For this it was willing to create a crisis in the NATO alliance, which met last month to consider, for the first time in its history, the possibility of an American withdrawal from a military engagement in Europe. Enlarging NATO has been a top administration priority. But now it is telling aspiring allies such as Romania and Estonia that their NATO membership may be at risk unless they promise not to cooperate with ICC investigations of Americans. Last week, the State Department told dozens of foreign diplomats that unless their countries make a similar pledge, they may lose U.S. military assistance. Major European and Asian allies are exempt from this threat; most poor countries in the developing world are not. Under the ICC Treaty, the United States is entitled to seek so-called Article 98 agreements that would prevent third countries from surrendering American suspects. But many countries that support the ICC will be reluctant to grant such agreements to a country so intent on undermining the court. Now they may be forced to choose between their commitment to the rule of law and their relationships with the United States. The last time I checked, the United States was pressing countries for military cooperation against terrorists who committed a crime against humanity. Now it is threatening to end military cooperation with many of the same countries if they try to meet their obligations to the ICC, which is also meant to bring terrible criminals to justice. The administration might also have considered that virtually every member of the ICC is a democracy. (Dictatorships such as China, Cuba and Sudan have not applied for fear of exposing themselves to the court's jurisdiction). This means that the threat to cut military assistance is also targeted primarily at democracies. As the State Department warned on Wednesday, it could risk U.S. relations with Colombia, which joined the ICC to pressure the rebels and paramilitaries terrorizing its people. It could deny aid to Mali, a young African democracy that joined in hopes of deterring potential coup plotters. Meanwhile, military aid to such repressive countries as Egypt, Uzbekistan and Saudi Arabia, which are not members of the ICC, wouldn't be jeopardized at all. This may be the only sanction in American diplomatic history aimed almost exclusively at governments that share American values -- the ultimate dumb sanction. Countries may avoid it by giving in to the administration's demands. But even then some of America's closest friends will feel mugged, and America will reap far more resentment than reward. Of course, the administration will argue that this is necessary to protect Americans from a rogue international court. But even if the ICC does go badly wrong, the most powerful nation in the history of the world surely will have the resources to defend itself against 18 judges in Holland who will have no army, police or independent enforcement power. The unlikely possibility that someday, somewhere, some American might be investigated by this court is no reason to threaten allies in the middle of a war, or to sanction fragile democracies whose success is important to America. Privately, many administration officials see this. But they seem trapped by their anti-ICC rhetoric, unable to end a reckless quest that has done more to hurt America than it could ever do to undermine this court. Those who share the president's original, more pragmatic world view must somehow get this message through: It's time to stop sacrificing the important to the trivial. The ICC tail must stop wagging the dog of American foreign policy.","United States",""

The U.S. Department of Justice has misused immigration charges to dodge legal restraints on its power to detain and interrogate people as it pursues its terrorist probe.  """"An immigration violation should not give the government license to rip up the rule book,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. """"By restricting judicial oversight and blocking public scrutiny, the government has exercised virtually unchecked power over those it has detained.""""  The ninety-five page report, """"Presumption of Guilt: Human Rights Abuses of Post-September 11 Detainees,"""" is based on Human Rights Watch interviews with scores of current and former detainees and their attorneys. The report provides the most comprehensive analysis yet of the Justice Department's treatment of non-citizens swept up in the post-September 11 investigation.  Human Rights Watch found that the U.S. government has held some detainees for prolonged periods without charges; impeded their access to counsel; subjected them to coercive interrogations; and overridden judicial orders to release them on bond during immigration proceedings. In some cases, the government has incarcerated detainees for months under restrictive conditions, including solitary confinement. Some detainees were physically and verbally abused because of their national origin or religion.  Some 1,200 non-citizens have been secretly arrested and incarcerated in connection with the September 11 investigation, although the government has not disclosed the exact number. The vast majority are from Middle Eastern, South Asian, and North African countries. The report describes cases in which random encounters with law enforcement or neighbors' suspicions based on no more than national origin and religion led to interrogation about possible links to terrorism.  At least 752 men were then held on immigration charges while the government continued to investigate them. Turning the presumption of innocence on its head, the Department of Justice kept them in detention until it decided they had no links to or knowledge of terrorism. None of the 752 men has been indicted for terrorist-related crimes. Most were ultimately removed from the United States.  Using immigration law violations to detain these men while they were criminally investigated enabled the Justice Department to deny non-citizens their rights under U.S. criminal law - for example, the right to court-appointed counsel and the right to be promptly charged after arrest. In some cases, the Justice Department flouted regular procedures to keep non-citizens in the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) on the off chance that they might be found to be engaged in terrorism, a practice that amounts to unlawful """"preventive detention.""""  """"The U.S. government has failed to uphold the very values that President Bush declared were under attack on September 11,"""" said Fellner. """"It has ignored basic restraints on a government's power to detain that are the hallmark of free and democratic nations.""""  Human Rights Watch also criticized the U.S. government for blocking the public's right to know what its government is doing. Secret arrests and secret hearings are incompatible with core democratic values of openness, government accountability, and the rule of law.  Human Rights Watch calls on the U.S. government to: Immediately release the names of all persons detained since September 11 in connection with the terrorism investigation, and reverse its policy of secret hearings; Inform all INS detainees of the charges against them within forty-eight hours of arrest or release them, and rescind the rule that permits indefinite delay in charging INS detainees in """"exceptional circumstances;"""" Advise all INS detainees who are questioned about terrorism of their right to remain silent, to have an attorney present during questioning, and to have one court-appointed if needed; and Comply immediately with all judicial orders to release detainees on bond, and stop keeping persons in INS detention until law enforcement decides that they are innocent of terrorist links.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/08/14/human-rights-watch-comments-council-europe-list-post-accession-commitments","Human Rights Watch Comments on the Council of Europe List of Post-Accession Commitments for Yugoslavia","Human Rights Watch Comments on the Council of Europe List of Post-Accession Commitments for Yugoslavia","","08/14/2002","On July 2, 2002, president of the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly Peter Schieder handed to the Chamber of Citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FR Yugoslavia) a list of commitments that the country must be """"determined to honour"""" following its accession to the Council of Europe. The FR Yugoslav authorities undertook to accept this list of commitments on August 29, 2002, in anticipation of the next plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly, to take place in the period September 23-27, 2002. An Assembly vote in favor of FR Yugoslavia's accession would allow the Committee of Ministers to invite the country to join the organization as its forty-fifth member state.   Human Rights Watch does not take a position on FR Yugoslavia's accession per se, but is concerned about the omission from the list of a number of key human rights requirements where urgent progress is warranted. These include fair and independent war crimes proceedings before national courts; preventing and punishing police violence; and protecting the Romani minority from discriminatory treatment. Genuine improvement in the human rights situation in FR Yugoslavia will not be possible unless these issues are addressed. Human Rights Watch urges the Parliamentary Assembly and the authorities of the FR Yugoslavia to ensure that references pertaining to these important areas, as detailed below, be included in the list of FR Yugoslavia's post-accession commitments:   Prosecution of War Crimes Before National Courts The Assembly list rightly insists on continued cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). A democratic society, dedicated to respect for human rights, cannot develop unless accountability for the most serious violations of human rights-war crimes-is established. However, the ICTY can only deal with a fraction of the war crimes cases. The tribunal's statute contemplates that where it deems appropriate, it may defer cases to competent national courts. As such, in June 2002, the tribunal devised a program of action whereby it would focus on the prosecution of the highest-ranking political and military figures, while the intermediary- and mid-level accused should be tried before national courts.   The issue of domestic war crimes trials in FR Yugoslavia should, therefore, figure on the list of its post-accession commitments. While the list of commitments includes requests that the authorities """"cooperate to establish the facts concerning the fate of missing people and giving all information concerning mass graves,"""" and that they """"largely inform the people of Serbia about the crimes committed by the regime of Slobodan Milosevic,"""" these requirements fall well below measures that would establish accountability in judicial proceedings of those responsible for the crimes.   To date, only two war crimes trials have been held in FR Yugoslavia, although hundreds of perpetrators of war crimes in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo live in the country. In just one additional case, the public prosecutor has filed an indictment against two suspects, one of whom has been detained while the other is still at large. There is a clear need for the Yugoslav authorities to commit to accountability for war crimes, including by creating competent and independent legal institutions that meet European fair trial standards and bring to justice individuals responsible for war crimes not being prosecuted before the ICTY.  In view of the foregoing, PACE members and the authorities of the FR Yugoslavia should consider amending the list of post-accession commitments, following the references to cooperation with the ICTY, to include language pertaining to the Yugoslav government's commitment:   To establish accountability of war crimes perpetrators before national courts, in full cooperation with the ICTY and with deference to its complementary jurisdiction, and in particular:  take an unequivocal public position that the prosecution of war crimes are a fundamental aspect of the rule of law and the principle of justice and a basic moral obligation owed to the victims;  where evidence indicates that war crimes have been committed, apply existing law and promptly and determinedly initiate war crimes proceedings, in accordance with fair trial standards contained in the European Convention on Human Rights and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.        Police Brutality The new authorities have not used police violence against the political opposition, but police abuses against ordinary citizens are still commonplace. The Serbian Ministry of Interior has either ignored allegations of police torture and ill-treatment made in the media and human rights reports, or claimed that it had no knowledge of the alleged events. Of the six known court decisions since October 2000 dealing with excessive use of force by the police, the convicted law enforcement officers received sentences of less than six months in prison, with the exception of one case in which an August 2002 verdict sentenced the two accused to eighteen and ten months imprisonment respectively.   The Belgrade Center for Human Rights registered cases of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment in ten cities in Serbia during 2001. The reports by the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center suggest that the trend has continued unabated in 2002. (Detailed descriptions of some of these cases, all of which date from 2002, are available in the enclosed Human Rights Watch briefing paper).   Despite recommendations by international monitoring bodies such as the U.N. Committee against Torture, FR Yugoslavia has not to date introduced a provision into its criminal law specifically defining torture as a criminal offense.   The new federal Criminal Procedure Act, which entered into force on March 28, 2002, obligates the police to provide an arrested person with immediate access to a lawyer. The police must also immediately inform the investigating judge about the arrest, and the judge may request to see the detained person at once. These provisions are intended to prevent arbitrary and excessive use of force by the police. However, the climate of impunity inherited from the previous regime and barely confronted by the current government raises doubts about the implementation of these new rules.   Human Rights Watch suggests that, in addition to the existing references to required improvements in policing structures and practices, the list of post-accession commitments pertaining to law enforcement also include an undertaking to:   Investigate and punish, through criminal or disciplinary proceedings, law enforcement officials who use excessive force or otherwise abuse their powers and, in particular: end the practice of denying outright the occurrence of police violence and promptly launch criminal investigations when allegations are made, including in cases of abuse targeting Roma;   strictly enforce existing laws on internal affairs that provide for disciplinary proceedings and sanctions against law enforcement officials who abuse their powers;  amend federal criminal law to specifically define torture as a criminal offense;  undertake a vetting procedure for all members of law enforcement structures; dismiss and, where appropriate, bring to justice those found to have committed human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations;    Violations of the Rights of Roma Since the change of government in October 2000, the authorities in Belgrade have enacted a law that recognizes the Romani population as a national minority, and they have increased the use of the Romani language in state television and radio programs. However, police brutality against Roma continues to be common, and discrimination in various fields of public life remains widespread. (For recent examples of police abuse against Roma, see Human Rights Watch briefing paper appended to this letter).   In addition to violent abuse and harassment on the part of law enforcement authorities, Roma in FR Yugoslavia also continue to suffer widespread discrimination in all fields of public life, including in education, housing, employment, health care, and access to public goods and services. Denial of access for Roma to privately owned restaurants and sports facilities is also commonplace. Although public prosecutors are duty bound to prosecute such cases ex officio, they routinely dismiss discrimination complaints or simply fail to take any action to address them.   Thousands of Romani families in FR Yugoslavia live in makeshift settlements in the vicinity of towns, left to survive without electricity, running water, or sewers. The position of displaced Roma from Kosovo has been particularly difficult because this group has suffered from both the lack of housing and police abuse. Roma displaced from Kosovo are also particularly vulnerable to arbitrary evictions from their makeshift homes, while the authorities have failed to provide them with alternative accommodation. (See appended Human Rights Watch briefing paper for details).   Human Rights Watch suggests that the authorities of the FR Yugoslavia and members of the Parliamentary Assembly explicitly address the discriminatory treatment of Roma in the list of post-accession commitments, including, for example, undertakings by the government to:  adopt effective measures to prevent and punish discrimination against Roma in all fields of public life, including in the judicial system, access to housing, education, employment, health care, and social services; and   adopt a comprehensive body of legislation prohibiting ethnic, racial and other forms of discrimination in all fields of public life and providing effective civil, criminal and administrative remedies for breach thereof.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Bush called for """"a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business world."""" Yet the State Department has recommended dismissal of a lawsuit alleging corporate complicity in violent human rights abuse in Indonesia. Its actions suggest that the administration's concern with corporate responsibility ends at the U.S. borders. The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Washington by 11 residents of Aceh, the westernmost province of Indonesia and site of a vicious war between separatist guerrillas and the Indonesian military. In the suit, the plaintiffs charge that they were raped, tortured or kidnapped - or their relatives murdered - by Indonesian soldiers paid to protect a big Exxon Mobil natural gas plant in the province. On a visit to Aceh a year ago for Human Rights Watch, I heard first-hand about atrocities by both sides. Often in reprisal for abusive guerrilla attacks, Indonesian troops shot and beat civilians and torched villages. The issue in the lawsuit is whether Exxon Mobil is complicit in these abuses through alleged """"logistical and material"""" support given to Indonesian troops protecting operations it runs in north Aceh. Exxon Mobil denies the allegations. The suit was brought under various U.S. federal statutes including the Alien Tort Claims Act of 1789. This law has been interpreted to permit victims of serious human rights violations abroad to seek civil damages in U.S. courts against their alleged abusers who are found in the United States. Despite its ancient vintage, the first human rights case was brought under the law only in 1979. Suits against corporations began in the 1990s, mostly against oil and mining companies operating in conflict-ridden countries. The Exxon Mobil suit could be an important test case clarifying the human rights rules governing efforts to maintain the security of such operations. At Exxon Mobil's suggestion, the judge in the case sought the nonbinding opinion of the State Department as to whether the suit would adversely affect American interests. The response, by the department's legal adviser, William Taft 4th, said that U.S. interests would be harmed and recommended the suit's dismissal. The State Department justifies its position with a series of strained and contradictory arguments. On the one hand, it fears an Indonesia so powerful that it will retaliate against U.S. companies and cease cooperating in the war on terrorism. On the other hand, it portrays an Indonesian economy so fragile that it could be devastated should the lawsuit discourage foreign investment. Clearly, both can't be true, and probably neither is. Indonesia cannot afford to turn its back on the world's largest economy. And the investment it needs should not be of the sort, as the suit alleges, that underwrites the separatist and communal violence plaguing the country. The State Department presumes that the Indonesian government will see the suit as """"interference in its internal affairs."""" To back this up, it submits a letter from the Indonesian ambassador in Washington taking exception to U.S. adjudication of """"an allegation against an Indonesian government institution."""" However, the suit is not brought against an Indonesian government institution but against Exxon Mobil for alleged complicity in serious human rights abuse. It is entirely appropriate for U.S. courts to uphold basic standards of conduct for U.S.-based corporations. The administration's position speaks poorly for its vision of both corporate responsibility and the war on terrorism. Corporate responsibility is not simply a matter of transparent balance sheets. It is also a matter of how companies treat people. Nor does it advance the war on terrorism for the U.S. government to turn a blind eye toward alleged security force violence against civilians. It is hypocritical and ineffective to accept such violence in the name of one's own cause while trying to deny it to others in pursuit of theirs. The Bush administration should support legal scrutiny of any allegation of violent abuse, not make exceptions when U.S. corporations are implicated.","Asia, United States, Indonesia",""

The government should also end the longstanding practice of using psychiatric incarceration for political ends.   The World Psychiatric Association (WPA) should actively investigate reports of systematic political abuse of psychiatry in China. The WPA's triennial World Congress meets in Yokohama, Japan from August 23-29, 2002.  In a 298-page report, """"Dangerous Minds: Political Psychiatry in China Today and its Origins in the Mao Era,"""" Human Rights Watch and the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry, a Netherlands-based international foundation, compare the treatment of dissidents in mental asylums to similar abuses in the former Soviet Union. The sentencing of political dissidents to special psychiatric hospitals on the basis of false diagnoses led to the forced withdrawal of the Soviet Union from the WPA in 1983 and it was not readmitted until 1989, after the Gorbachev reforms had brought an end to systematic political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union.  """"The world medical community should speak out on this important issue,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The Chinese psychiatrists who bravely refuse to participate in state repression need to feel they have support from abroad.""""  It appears that only a minority of Chinese psychiatrists have actually been involved in these practices. Other psychiatrists have written extensively about """"political cases"""" in the Chinese professional literature, perhaps with the goal of forcing a broader ethical debate both inside and outside of China.  Extensive documentary evidence makes it clear that the political use of psychiatry was much more common in China during the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) than in either the former Soviet Union or China today. During that turbulent period, the official view was that virtually all forms of mental illness were caused by politically deviant thoughts.  However, official psychiatric theory in China continues to condone the involuntary treatment in custodial mental asylums of dissidents and nonconformists including Falun Gong members, independent labor organizers, whistle blowers and individuals who complain about political persecution or official misconduct.  Wang Wanxing, a political activist whose family is still seeking his immediate release, was first arrested in the mid-1970s. He was arrested again in 1992 and held in an institution for the criminally insane based on a diagnosis by police psychiatrists that he was a """"paranoid psychotic."""" Wang was released in 1999 but later that year was returned to the same institution when he attempted to discuss his incarceration with foreign journalists. He remains in detention and is being treated for """"political monomania,"""" according to government officials.  While it is impossible to know precisely how many such persons are currently being held in mental asylums alongside the genuinely mentally ill, numerous official documents from China included in """"Dangerous Minds"""" state that during the 1980s, the percentage of people held in asylums who were being punished for committing political offenses was as high as 15 percent of the total criminal psychiatric caseload.  """"The WPA delegates should adopt a strong resolution in Yokohama calling on China to cease these abuses and to fully cooperate with a WPA investigation,"""" said Robert van Voren, general secretary of the Geneva Initiative on Psychiatry. """"A WPA-led delegation should visit the asylums, carry out independent medical examinations, and monitor conditions and treatment, especially in the police-run asylums.""""  Under the WPA's Madrid Declaration, passed in 1996, all forms of psychiatric diagnosis or treatment on the basis of the political needs of governments are explicitly forbidden.  Human Rights Watch and the Geneva Initiative also urged the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and Ill-Treatment to address the issue of political psychiatric abuse in China.  They called on the Chinese government to conduct a systematic review of China's legislation and administrative regulations governing forensic psychiatric assessment, the interactions between police and psychiatrists, and to remove all provisions stating or implying that dissident or nonconformist beliefs provide a justifiable basis for the diagnosis of mental illness.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Security Council must stand behind its intention of delivering justice to victims of both sides in the conflict that devastated Rwanda in 1994, Human Rights Watch said today. In a letter to current Security Council President John Negroponte, Human Rights Watch stressed the importance of bringing to justice not only those behind the genocide but also members of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in 1994.     """"The Rwandan Patriotic Army murdered thousands in 1994, committing war crimes and crimes against humanity,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The president of Rwanda, Paul Kagame, himself has admitted that some of his soldiers committed abuses. But now the Rwandan government opposes bringing the accused before international justice.""""     In 1994, the Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to prosecute genocide and other crimes against humanity committed in Rwanda. Until now, the tribunal has tried only those accused of genocide. But the chief prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, recently announced that she would seek indictments against some members of the RPA for violating international humanitarian law. Her effort to pursue the worst abuses by both sides to the conflict parallels her work in the former Yugoslavia.     Since then, the Rwandan government has hindered the travel of witnesses, causing the suspension of three genocide trials. It has also failed to provide documents requested by the prosecutor. The prosecutor reported these obstructions to the Security Council in late July.     The Rwandan government says the tribunal should try only genocide cases and leave any possible prosecution of RPA members to Rwandan courts. But victims of RPA crimes in 1994 have little chance for justice within the country. Rwandan military courts have tried very few RPA soldiers for 1994 crimes and those convicted have received light sentences. Rwandan authorities also have banned the newly created gacaca or people's courts from trying crimes by RPA soldiers.     In response to the prosecutor's charges, the Rwandan government repeated its own frequently voiced criticisms of the tribunal's performance.     """"Rwandan authorities deplore the failures of the tribunal, and there have been some,"""" said Roth.

The bodies of Muzafar Avazov and Husnidin Alimov, both religious prisoners at Jaslyk Prison, were returned to family members for burial in Tashkent Thursday. Individuals who had seen one of the bodies told Human Rights Watch that it showed clear signs of torture. The authorities reportedly restricted viewing of the second body. Both men had been imprisoned at Jaslyk Prison, well-known for its harsh conditions and ill-treatment and torture of religious prisoners. Human Rights Watch has learned that the body of Muzafar Avazov, a 35-year old father of four, showed signs of burns on the legs, buttocks, lower back and arms. Sixty to seventy percent of the body was burnt, according to official sources. Doctors who saw the body reported that such burns could only have been caused by immersing Avazov in boiling water. Those who saw the body also reported that there was a large, bloody wound on the back of the head, heavy bruising on the forehead and side of the neck, and that his hands had no fingernails. """"These deaths reveal the horror of Uzbek prisons,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"It seems the small signs of progress on torture we had seen were mere window-dressing, intended to hide Uzbekistan's persistent problem and placate international critics."""" These latest incidents of serious human rights violations could complicate Uzbekistan's relations with the United States. The United States has allied itself closely with Uzbekistan in the war against terrorism, but U.S. government officials have expressed concern that Uzbekistan's harsh treatment of independent Muslims could be counterproductive to the anti-terror effort. The U.S. government recently adopted a law requiring that before delivering aid to the Uzbek government, the Bush administration must determine that Uzbekistan is making """"substantial and continuing progress"""" in meeting the human rights commitments contained in a U.S.-Uzbekistan March 2002 joint declaration. Uzbek authorities, including numerous police officers, brought the body of Muzafar Avazov, to the family home at about 3:30 p.m. on August 8. Police cars surrounded the area and checked visitors who approached the house, preventing some from entering. When the burial occurred at 6:00 p.m. that evening, police closed the road to traffic. Authorities from the office of General Prosecutor Rashidjon Kodirov reportedly threatened the family not to talk to the media or give interviews to others about the circumstances surrounding Avazov's death. In May 2002, Human Rights Watch received reports that prison authorities had beaten Muzafar Avazov and put him in a punishment cell for stating that nothing could stop him from performing his prayers. The authorities also returned the body of 34-year old Husnidin Alimov to his family in Tashkent on August 8, but they reportedly restricted viewing of the body. Prior to the death, relatives of people imprisoned in Jaslyk told Human Rights Watch that prison officials had placed Alimov in a punishment cell. He was reportedly placed there before the end of June and spent many weeks there before his death. Prisoners are often placed in such cells for praying or refusing to ask for forgiveness from Uzbek President Islam Karimov. Conditions are reportedly severe and beatings common. """"Deaths under such circumstances are highly suspicious,"""" said Andersen. """"The Uzbek government must ensure that full and open investigations are conducted into these deaths and into the conditions and treatment of prisoners in Jaslyk. There is an urgent need for regular, independent, international monitoring of conditions there."""" A large number of police accompanied Alimov's body and were present during the funeral. The father of another man who died in May, apparently after terrible beatings in Jaslyk, was reportedly detained by police directly after the funeral and sentenced Friday to 15 days in custody on an administrative charge, related to his attendance at the funeral. Police reportedly questioned him about how he heard about the funeral and why he attended. Both men were serving prison sentences on charges related to their religious activity. Since 1997, the government of Uzbekistan has waged a campaign against religious Muslims who practice their faith outside of state controls. The peaceful expression of independent religious views has landed thousands in prison on charges of extremism. The government has particularly targeted members of Hizb ut-Tahrir, a banned Islamic group that calls for the peaceful reestablishment of the Caliphate in Central Asia. Uzbek authorities routinely prosecute those accused of affiliation with the group on charges of anti-state activities or possession or distribution of """"illegal religious materials."""" """"Torture is an unmistakable feature of this campaign,"""" said Andersen. In the past fifteen months alone, Human Rights Watch has documented 11 deaths arising from suspicious circumstances in custody. According to information from the human rights group Memorial, Alimov was sentenced in 1999 to 16 years in prison, on a range of charges, including spreading religious """"extremist"""" materials. Avazov was sentenced in mid-2000 to 20 years in prison. He had been accused of membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir.

Ambassador John Negroponte President of the Security Council United States Permanent Mission  to the United Nations 7019 UN Plaza New York, NY 10017   Dear Ambassador Negroponte:   In 1994 soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) killed thousands of civilians, in the process committing war crimes and crimes against humanity. A U.N. Commission of Experts concluded that the RPA had """"perpetrated serious breaches of international humanitarian law"""" and """"crimes against humanity."""" The Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to prosecute not just the genocide that had devastated Rwanda but also """"other systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law"""" (Security Council Resolution 955, 1994), including those committed by members of the RPA. The government of Rwanda now opposes the prosecution of RPA members by the tribunal. In confronting this challenge, the Security Council should demonstrate its commitment to the equitable justice essential for long-term peace in Central Africa by calling on Rwanda to cooperate fully with the tribunal.   On July 23 the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda reported to the Security Council that the Rwandan government was hindering the progress of genocide trials as a way of pressuring her to slow down investigations of crimes allegedly committed by members of the RPA in 1994. The recent difficulties between the tribunal and the Rwandan government began soon after the prosecutor announced that indictments would be sought against members of the RPA. In at least two meetings with high-ranking United Nations or tribunal officials, Rwandan President Paul Kagame has privately expressed concern at the speed with which investigations against RPA officers and soldiers are progressing-exactly contrary to the official Rwandan government position deploring the slowness with which the tribunal works. The Rwandan government suggests that the tribunal should try only cases of genocide and leave prosecution of RPA crimes to Rwandan courts. It asserts that these courts have tried, convicted, and punished RPA members who committed abuses. But the trials have been few and the penalties of those convicted have been light. Only one senior officer, a major, has been tried for massacres committed in 1994. Convicted by court martial in January 1998 after confessing to having ordered the slaughter of more than thirty civilians, he was sentenced to life in prison, but he successfully appealed his sentence and was freed soon after. By June 1998 five others had been convicted of capital offenses committed in 1994, but four were privates and one a corporal, and all received light sentences. The corporal, convicted of having killed fifteen civilians, was punished by only two years in prison.   Most Rwandans know nothing of these RPA trials or discount their importance because of the small number and light penalties involved. Victims of RPA abuses in 1994, their families, and many other Rwandans continue to demand justice for these crimes.   The Rwandan government has just launched an innovative popular justice program called gacaca courts, with the stated purpose of delivering justice and contributing to reconciliation. Although the law establishing these new jurisdictions mandates them to try crimes against humanity and war crimes, Rwandan government authorities have made it clear from the start that these popular courts are to deal only with accusations of genocide. Despite such clear orders, Rwandans continue asking gacaca courts to list those killed by RPA soldiers among the victims of 1994 and they ask that these local courts bring implicated RPA soldiers to justice. So far their requests have been in vain.   Rwandan authorities have told Rwandans, as they have told the Security Council, that Rwandan courts will deal with RPA crimes. Had Rwandan prosecutors wanted to try these crimes, they have had ample time to act. They have also had ample evidence: RPA violations of international humanitarian law have been documented by monitors of the field office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, by the U.N. Commission of Experts, and by Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues in various publications, including a detailed account in Leave None to Tell the Story (1999).   In a response to the prosecutor, the Rwandan government concludes correctly that the tribunal is at a crossroads and that its credibility is at stake. But its credibility does not hinge on any of the improvements suggested by the Rwandan government, useful though some of them might be. It hangs rather on the full implementation of its mandate as established by the Security Council in 1994.   Victims of RPA crimes have virtually no chance of obtaining justice in any Rwandan court, whether military court or gacaca court. Failing to provide them justice at the international tribunal as well will feed resentment and desire for revenge, explosive sentiments in a region where armed groups continue to operate in opposition to recognized governments.   We urge the Security Council to address the central issue, namely the need for the prosecutor to be able to investigate and charge those who committed the gravest crimes in 1994, whether genocide or other violations of international humanitarian law. In this we are asking that the prosecutor be given the same latitude to pursue the worst abuses by all sides to the conflict as she has in the former Yugoslavia. By insisting that the Rwandan government give its full cooperation by facilitating the travel of witnesses and by providing documentation needed by the prosecutor, the Security Council will fulfill its original intention of contributing to justice as the basis for peace and reconciliation in the region.

Africa is due to chair the next session of the commission on a rotational basis, and Libya was nominated by the African regional group. Libya's nomination was confirmed at the recently concluded inaugural summit of the new African Union. The commission will begin its annual session in March 2003.  """"Countries with dreadful rights records should never be in charge of chairing the Commission on Human Rights,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"Libya's long record of human rights abuses clearly does not merit such a reward.""""  Human Rights Watch said Libya's nomination violated commitments African leaders had made to promote human rights and good governance through the New African Partnership for Development (Nepad). Nepad's steering group comprises Presidents Mbeki of South Africa, Wade of Senegal, Obasanjo of Nigeria, Moi of Kenya and Gaddafi of Libya.  """"It's a real setback for African governments' stated new commitment to human rights,"""" said Mungoven.  The Nepad establishes a code of governance supporting basic freedoms and a system of peer review among African governments to hold each other to account for human rights violations, among other things. The scheme has received qualified support from international donors, including members of the G-8 group of industrialized nations.  """"Libya's appointment to the steering group of Nepad has already raised the eyebrows among supporters of Nepad,"""" Mungoven said. """"But putting Libya forward as Africa's choice to lead the world's human rights forum should really ring alarm bells.""""  Over the last decade, Libya has detained government opponents for years without charge or trial, prohibited the formation of political parties or independent non-governmental groups, and muzzled its press. In the past, the Libyan government has also been responsible for torture, """"disappearances"""" and the assassination of political opponents abroad.  In a letter to Presidents Obasanjo, Wade and Mbeki, Human Rights Watch called on Nepad leaders to withdraw Libya's nomination or spell out publicly the clear benchmarks for African participation in the commission, consistent with Nepad's goals. Donor governments considering financial support to Nepad should make their concerns known and call for Libya's withdrawal.

The civil suit, filed on June 11, 2001 in the District of Columbia, alleges that the Indonesian military provided """"security services"""" for Exxon Mobil's joint venture in Indonesia's conflict-ridden Aceh province, and that the Indonesian military committed """"genocide, murder, torture, crimes against humanity, sexual violence and kidnapping"""" while providing security for the company from 1999 to 2001. The plaintiff's claim that Exxon Mobil was aware of widespread abuses committed by the military but had failed to take any action to prevent them.  In the wake of business scandals involving Enron and WorldCom, among others, U.S. President George Bush has called for """"a new ethic of personal responsibility in the business world,"""" arguing that Americans need """"confidence in the character and conduct of all of our business leaders.""""  """"Corporate responsibility shouldn't stop at the water's edge,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"If the Bush administration is serious about promoting ethical business practices, it shouldn't be trying to stop this court case from going forward.""""  Human Rights Watch is not a party to the lawsuit and takes no position on claims regarding Exxon Mobil in Indonesia, but is deeply concerned that the State Department would request that the case be dismissed rather than taking a neutral position and allow the legal proceeding to run its course.  Background  The case was filed by the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF), a U.S. non-governmental organization, on behalf of eleven anonymous plaintiffs against Exxon Mobil in a U.S. Federal Court in the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs allege that Exxon Mobil violated the U.S. Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture Victims Protection Act, international human rights law, and the statutory and common law of the District of Columbia. The suit held that Exxon Mobil was liable for the alleged abuses because it provided """"logistical and material"""" support to the military.  Exxon Mobil vigorously denied the allegations and said the lawsuit """"recently filed by the International Labor Rights Fund (ILRF) containing these allegations is without merit and designed to bring publicity to their organization.""""  The company later petitioned U.S. District Court Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer, the presiding judge in the case, to solicit an opinion from the State Department whether this suit would have an adverse effect on U.S. foreign policy. On May 10, Judge Oberdorfer sent a letter to the State Department requesting """"out of an abundance of caution, in the tense times in which we are living…whether the Department of State has an opinion (non-binding) as to whether adjudication of this case at this time would impact adversely on interests of the United States"""" and seeks specifics about """"the nature and significance of that impact."""" The letter stated that the plaintiffs alleged that """"Exxon Mobil Corporation and various of its subsidiaries and affiliates ('Exxon') are legally responsible for human rights violations suffered by plaintiffs at the hands of an Indonesian Army unit engaged by Exxon to provide security for its Arun Project in Aceh, Indonesia.""""  The State Department argued that the Indonesian government would view judicial scrutiny of the company's conduct as a referendum on the human rights record of the Indonesian armed forces, which would dissuade it from cooperating with the United States in counter terrorism. However, the State Department itself routinely criticizes the human rights record of the Indonesian military in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices while maintaining diplomatic relations. Indeed, in its letter to Judge Oberdorfer, it condemned """"human rights abuses by elements of the Indonesian armed forces in locations such as Aceh.""""  The State Department could have issued a neutral opinion on the suit, but instead sided with Exxon Mobil and sent a response to Judge Oberdorfer on July 29, 2002 arguing that the case should be dismissed.  The State Department also argued that the litigation's """"potential effects on Indonesia's economy could…adversely affect important United States interests"""" and could impede further cooperation with U.S. companies. It said that continued business with U.S. companies would expose the Indonesian government and local companies to the highest business standards as another justification for dismissing the lawsuit, even though the suit could determine whether Exxon Mobil did follow acceptable business practices.  """"The administration can't simultaneously argue that U.S. companies impart the best business practices in Indonesia while trying to dismiss a case that could determine whether a U.S. company actually followed those practices,"""" said Roth.  The State Department claimed that the suit may actually hurt progress on human rights in Indonesia. Indonesian human rights groups, however, fear that the State Department's letter will bolster and legitimize the Indonesian military's resistance to judicial scrutiny of abuses, especially in conjunction with the U.S. government's recent decision to resume limited military cooperation with Indonesia. Human Rights Watch has strongly criticized the resumption of U.S. military assistance because it could undermine efforts to strengthen civilian and judicial oversight of the military without clear conditions on human rights. (For more information see """"The Indonesian Military and Ongoing Abuses,"""" a Human Rights Watch backgrounder, July 2002 available here. State Department Undercuts Indonesian Peace, Judiciary  The State Department's efforts to influence the case also undercuts credibility of U.S. efforts to promote an independent judiciary in Indonesia that is free of political interference. Ironically, when a suit by the Karaha Bodas Company, a joint-venture of two U.S. firms, against the Indonesia state energy firm, Pertamina, came up in talks with his counterpart last week in Jakarta, Colin Powell reportedly explained that the U.S. government does not interfere with ongoing court cases.  Two weeks before the State Department sent its opinion to Judge Oberdorfer, Indonesia's Ambassador to the U.S., Soemadi DM Brotodiningrat, sent a strongly worded letter objecting to the lawsuit to Richard L. Armitage, the U.S. Deputy Secretary of State. Chillingly, the Ambassador noted that the lawsuit """"will definitely compromise the serious efforts of the Indonesian government to guarantee the safety of foreign investments, including in particular those from the United States.""""  The ambassador's letter also warned that the suit would have an adverse impact on peace talks in Aceh that are """"at an extremely sensitive and delicate stage."""" However, the Indonesian security forces have increased military operations, proposed martial law, and arrested Acehnese peace negotiators since those negotiations began.  """"Instead of condemning the Indonesian government's threats against American investors and the Aceh peace process, the State Department has apparently buckled to them,"""" Roth said.  In late June 2002, Exxon Mobil notified the State Department that it had joined the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights program that began in 2000 and has been adopted by both the Clinton and Bush administrations. The program was developed by the State Department in conjunction with the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, multinational oil and mining companies, and human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch. According to the State Department, the program is designed to """"guide Companies in maintaining the safety and security of their operations within an operating framework that ensures respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.""""  """"It is the height of hypocrisy for the State Department to publicly promote human rights principles for the oil and gas industry and then tell a judge that scrutiny of an oil company's human rights record runs counter to foreign policy,"""" said Roth.

It is our understanding that the United States government is currently seeking to restore a joint program aimed at intercepting aircraft suspected of transporting illegal drugs. We would strongly urge you to reject any such program if it entails the unlawful use of lethal force against civilians.   As you well know, international law enforcement standards strictly limit the use of lethal force against fleeing suspects. Principal 9 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (adopted in 1990 by the Eighth U.N. Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders) permits the intentional use of lethal force by law enforcement officials only """"when strictly unavoidable to protect life."""" Firearms may be used against criminal suspects only """"in self-defense or defense of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury"""" or a """"grave threat to life"""" and only when """"less extreme means are insufficient.""""   We are deeply troubled, therefore, by the possibility that a renewed aerial anti- narcotic program in Peru could violate these norms by authorizing the downing of aircraft that refuse to observe identification procedures or disregard orders to land. Unless these aircraft actually present a threat of death or serious bodily injury to law enforcement officers or third parties, they cannot be considered legitimate targets of lethal force.   We have raised these concerns repeatedly with the U.S. government. In a letter to President George W. Bush in July 2001, for example, we explained how the use of lethal force in aerial anti-narcotics operations in Peru had violated international law. Unfortunately, however, it appears that the U.S. government may now be seeking to evade responsibility for these violations rather than end ing them. A renewed program in which Peruvian pilots alone do all the work could leave the Peruvian government to take all the blame for the violations that inevitably occur.   It is important to stress that any such program would be entirely unacceptable even if it incorporated measures aimed at avoiding """"mistakes"""" such as the downing of a plane transporting an American missionary family last year. The airspace where anti- narcotic interceptions occur is frequently crisscrossed by aircraft transporting business people, missionaries, tourists, and other law-abiding civilians, making implementation of any such measures hazardous at best. But even if """"mistakes"""" could be avoided in the future, the downing of aircraft that pose no imminent threat to human life will still be a violation of international law, no matter what their cargo may contain.   Although policymakers commonly refer to counter-narcotics efforts in terms of a """"war on drugs,"""" it is important to keep in mind that this label is entirely rhetorical in nature. The effort to curb drug trafficking is not war, it is law enforcement, and should be guided by law enforcement standards. Suspects may not be fired on as if they were combatants in an armed conflict, however well-founded suspicions ma y be that they are engaged in illicit activity.   Peru has itself already embraced this fundamental principle in its efforts to curb street crime and outbreaks of violence during demonstrations. I urge you not to compromise it now in the name of drug enforcement. Just as your government would never permit the summary execution of people selling drugs in the street, it would be unconscionable for it to allow suspected traffickers to be summarily shot down in the air.   I appreciate your attention to this important matter. And I would be most grateful to have an opportunity to discuss it with you further next week during my visit to Lima.

We have some concerns and recommendations we hope you will consider.  The trials occurring before the Special Panels are crucial both to bring justice to the victims of past violence, and to strengthen accountability and the rule of law. As you know, the UN's International Commission of Inquiry recommended in January 2000 that an international tribunal be created for East Timor. No such tribunal was created -- largely due to strong resistance from the Indonesian government -- and the Special Panels and the Ad Hoc Human Rights Court in Jakarta must try to fill that void. The Special Panels also have many of the features of a mixed national-international tribunal due to UNTAET's extensive role in their creation and administration, and the presence of international judges and prosecutors. We are concerned about the perception in East Timor and in the international community that justice is not being done.  We are aware of the devastated condition of East Timor's justice system when UNTAET and the transitional governing structures began their work. We also realize that efforts have been made to improve the Serious Crimes Unit in particular and to improve administration and the defense bar through new positions. In addition, the UN and the Justice Ministry share responsibility for the Special Panels. But there are some long-standing concerns that have yet to be resolved. We hope that the Ministry of Justice will work with the UN to achieve progress in these areas as soon as possible:  Ensure adequate defense: We understand that three international Public Defenders positions have been created (with two still vacant), following a period of inadequate defense and reliance on lawyers seconded by international NGOs. We urge that the remaining two posts be filled as quickly as possible with well-qualified lawyers, that adequate resources be provided to these posts, and that the pool of public defenders be expanded as necessary to meet defendants' needs.  Address the problem of empty seats on the Court of Appeal: Two out of three chairs are empty after the contracts of the sitting judges ended. There is now a backlog as nearly all Serious Crimes cases have been appealed.  Address the problem of empty seats on the Special Panels: One of the Special Panels is short an international judge, and we understand a Timorese judge is on maternity leave. This means that one panel must borrow a judge from the other, and the two panels are unable to sit concurrently.  When recruiting judges, ensure appropriate experience: International judges should have sufficient grounding in international human rights and humanitarian law. To ensure the appointment of judges with considerable trial experience, the job level for judges should be raised from its current P-3 level. Ensure adequate trial transcription or, at a minimum, effective audio recording: There are no written trial transcripts. Audio recordings on CD-ROMS are now being used, but 3-5 languages are used in any given trial. According to one source, on at least one recording, all languages were recorded together on a single, unintelligible track. The lack of a tracking mechanism for the CD-ROMS makes it very difficult to locate particular testimony. We understand that as a result the recordings are rarely used and much time is devoted to disputes about prior testimony.  Address the lack of qualified interpreters: Proceedings are often delayed while an interpreter is located, or interrupted to check or protest the quality of translations, in those cases where a Timorese judge or a Malaysian case manager can catch the translation problems.  Institute a trial calendar: The absence of a trial calendar for the court means that days of trial are lost because people do not know when their case is on the calendar and do not attend.  Provide judges with necessary support staff: The judges lack law clerks and secretaries, hampering their ability to conduct legal research.  We understand a position has been filled at the beginning of July to help coordinate court administration. This may be an opportunity to address longstanding recommendations relating to court administration.  Adequate funding is necessary to ensure the Special Panels can deliver justice to all parties. The UN, the Timorese government, and bilateral donors share responsibility in this area. However, some basic administrative and staffing changes will not require significant new funding and should be implemented immediately.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or we can be of assistance.

The new law authorizes the use of military force to liberate any American or citizen of a U.S.-allied country being held by the court, which is located in The Hague. This provision, dubbed the """"Hague invasion clause,"""" has caused a strong reaction from U.S. allies around the world, particularly in the Netherlands.     In addition, the law provides for the withdrawal of U.S. military assistance from countries ratifying the ICC treaty, and restricts U.S. participation in United Nations peacekeeping unless the United States obtains immunity from prosecution. At the same time, these provisions can be waived by the president on """"national interest"""" grounds.     """"The states that have ratified this treaty are trying to strengthen the rule of law,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"The Bush administration is trying to punish them for that.""""     Dicker pointed out that many of the ICC's biggest supporters are fragile democracies and countries emerging from human rights crises, such as Sierra Leone, Argentina and Fiji.     The law is part of a multi-pronged U.S. effort against the International Criminal Court. On May 6, in an unprecedented move, the Bush administration announced it was """"renouncing"""" U.S. signature on the treaty. In June, the administration vetoed continuation of the U.N. peacekeeping force in Bosnia in an effort to obtain permanent immunity for U.N. peacekeepers. In July, U.S. officials launched a campaign around the world to obtain bilateral agreements that would grant immunity for Americans from the court's authority. Yesterday, Washington announced that it obtained such an agreement from Romania.     However, another provision of the bill allows the United States to assist international efforts to bring to justice those accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity - including efforts by the ICC.     """"The administration never misses an opportunity to gratuitously antagonize its allies on the ICC,"""" said Dicker.

The 50-page report, """"Paying the Price: Worker Unrest in Northeast China,"""" analyzes in detail the demonstrations that took place from March through May 2002 in three cities in northeastern China, and the government response to them. """"The Chinese Communist Party is facing a serious dilemma: it claims to protect workers, but those very same workers are protesting in the streets,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The workers want the right to form their own trade unions. They want to have a voice in decisions affecting their work and their benefits."""" The unprecedented demonstrations lasted longer than any since the 1989 pro-democracy movement. In Liaoyang, metal workers laid off from former state-owned enterprises took to the streets intermittently over a ten-week period. In Daqing, laid-off oil workers encountered a massive show of force and security forces detained at least sixty workers for periods ranging between twenty-four hours and two weeks. In Fushun, thousands of laid-off miners and workers from nearby factories blocked roads and rail lines until they were given limited payouts. Four key protest leaders in Liaoyang city were indicted on March 30, 2002 after leading a four-year effort to bring workers' complaints to the attention of local authorities. They may be put on trial at any time. Yao Fuxin, Pang Qingxiang, Xiao Yunliang and Wang Zhaoming are charged with """"illegal assembly, marches and protests"""" and could face five-year prison terms. The four men have been held for almost five months with little, if any, access to family and with no legal representation. Across China, state-owned enterprises that once promised workers lifetime employment and a secure retirement have downsized or closed. Many workers, some with decades on the job, are owed months in back pay and have lost their pensions, as well as health and social welfare benefits. """"These workers are protesting the hypocrisy of the Chinese government,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Although the Chinese constitution calls workers 'the masters of the country,' the government treats protesting workers as criminals."""" Chinese law prohibits workers from organizing independently. Only one organization, the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), can legally represent workers, and it is under the control of state authorities. It has never spoken out against the laws and regulations routinely used to justify putting independent labor activists in prison. Human Rights Watch found that the Chinese government's response to all three protests was relatively restrained, in part perhaps because labor unrest threatens the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party, and authorities fear an even broader backlash if they crack down too hard. In their handling of the protests, however, Chinese officials violated fundamental rights to free association, expression and assembly. Authorities refused to issue permits for demonstrations, threatened employed workers with loss of pay if family members took part in rallies, and placed restrictions on media access to the affected areas. Security forces physically assaulted protesters, seizing many for short periods of time and refusing to release them until they promised to forego further protests. Human Rights Watch called on the Chinese government to immediately and unconditionally release all those detained for peaceful activities to promote the rights of workers to associate freely. This urgent request applies to workers held in connection with this year's protests in the northeast, to those held for trade union activism during the 1989 pro-democracy movement and in 1992 and 1997-98, and to those in prison for exposing workers' problems to a broad audience within China and to the international media. China should also fulfill its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights that it ratified in 2001. China has declared that the application of Article 8(1)(a) must be consistent with China's Trade Union Law--the very law that denies China's workers the right to organize independent trade unions. As a member of the International Labor Organization (ILO), China is obligated to abide by its core principles, including free association and the right to collective bargaining. Human Rights Watch called on China's trading partners and governments involved in bilateral human rights """"dialogues"""" to put pressure on Beijing to ask ILO's assistance in reforming its labor practices to bring them into conformity with international freedom of association standards. Human Rights Watch further appealed to corporations doing business in China, urging that they refrain from complying with requests from Chinese authorities to discriminate against, fire, or in any way discipline workers who attempt to form their own unions, peacefully protest their conditions of work, or go on strike.","Asia, China and Tibet","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

It also includes a provision sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy that, for the first time, makes assistance to the Uzbek government conditional on that country's efforts to improve its human rights record and to institute political and legal reform.

In the Declaration, Uzbekistan pledged, among other things, to:  - build a """"strong and open civil society"""" - ensure """"respect for human rights and freedoms based on the universally recognized principles and norms of international law"""" - establish a """"genuine multi-party system"""" - ensure """"free and fair elections"""" - permit """"political pluralism, diversity of opinions and the freedom to express them"""" and ensure the """"independence of the media"""" - provide for separation of powers, including through """"the establishment of a freely elected and multi-party bicameral legislature"""" - ensure the """"independence of the courts""""  Since signing the Declaration, Uzbekistan has failed to make significant improvements in any of these areas, Human Rights Watch said.

New York, August 2, 2002) The convictions on July 31 of two more Syrian political activists is another sign that the government of Bashar al-Asad is intent on stifling independent voices and moving backwards on freedom of expression, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch called on President Asad to unconditionally release Dalila and Bunni, as well as eight others who were arrested as part of a clampdown in August and September 2001.  """"Instead of fulfilling public expectations of more space for political debate, the government is closing it down,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The imprisonment of Syria's peaceful political critics is disgraceful.""""  Professor Dalila and Dr. al-Bunni were both found guilty on three counts: attempting to change the constitution by illegal means, inciting armed rebellion, and spreading false information, according to a defense lawyer. Each count carried a separate prison term but the sentences reportedly will be served concurrently, not consecutively.  Since August 2001, the government has arrested ten outspoken advocates of political reform, including individuals involved in organizing the independent civic forums that became popular throughout the country after the death of president Hafez al-Asad in 2000.  Four of those arrested were tried and sentenced earlier this year: members of parliament Mamoun Homsi and Riad al-Seif, to five years imprisonment, in March and April, respectively; veteran political activist Riad al-Turk, to thirty months in June; and human rights activist Habib Saleh, to three years, also in June. Homsi and Seif were tried in the Damascus criminal court. The others were prosecuted in the state security court. The court's procedures do not meet international fair-trial standards and its judgments cannot be appealed. The parliamentarians' convictions were upheld on appeal.  """"Syrian activists are only trying to voice their opinions and create independent institutions in a landscape devastated by decades of repression,"""" Megally said. """"These trials and harsh sentences send an intimidating message to others wishing to exercise basic rights such as freedom of expression and association."""" He urged President Bashar al-Asad to release unconditionally all ten activists and take immediate steps to de-criminalize peaceful political expression.  Aref Dalila, 59, has been held in solitary confinement since early May and not permitted to leave his cell, according to information Human Rights Watch received on July 17. He has thrombosis in his left leg, a condition that developed 10 years ago and required an operation six years ago, and has used anti-coagulant medication ever since. Professor Dalila currently suffers from inflammation of his back, which may be explained by the dampness of his cell and his prolonged confinement there.  Dr. Walid al-Bunni, born in 1964, is an ear, nose and throat specialist. He is married and the father of three children.

The report, mandated by a U.N. General Assembly resolution after Israeli objections forced the Secretary-General to disband a U.N. fact-finding team, largely limits itself to presenting competing accounts of the events during the Israeli military operations. The report doesn't move us forward in terms of establishing the truth,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Its watered-down account of the very serious violations in Jenin exposes the risk of compiling a report without any first-hand information.""""  While the report describes some general allegations that have been made about the conduct of the Israeli and Palestinian sides during the Israeli operation, it draws almost no conclusions on the merits of those claims. It makes only limited reference to the obligations of the parties under international law, makes few clear conclusions about violations of that law, and does not raise the issue of accountability for serious violations that may have been committed, some of which rise to the level of war crimes. Its information and analysis are strongest when dealing with the blockage of humanitarian and medical access to the camp.  Human Rights Watch said part of the report's problems stems from the terms of its mandate. Set up by a U.N. General Assembly resolution after the Secretary-General was forced by Israel's objections to disband a U.N. fact-finding mission, the report was collated from existing sources. The report was hampered still further when the government of Israel did not comply with the United Nation's request for information.  """"Even with what they had, they could have done more,"""" Megally said.  Examples of the report's failings include the following:  It refers to the fact that civilians died in the operation, without examining the circumstances of their deaths. It makes no mention of the strong evidence suggesting that some were willfully killed, such as Jamal Fayid, a 37-year old paralyzed man, who was crushed in the rubble of his home on April 7 after Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers refused to allow his family time to remove him from their home before a bulldozer destroyed it.  The U.N. report mentions that missiles were """"at times"""" fired from helicopters, minimizing evidence suggesting that their use was intense and indiscriminate in Jenin camp, particularly on April 6 when missiles caught many sleeping civilians.  In its section dealing with abuses outside Jenin, the report fails to consider the systematic targeting of the offices of Palestinian media organizations, as well as the serious impediments faced by international journalists and human rights monitors attempting to document events.  It does not discuss what, if any, steps the parties have taken to investigate credible allegations of violations of international humanitarian law raised in the report-vital for ensuring accountability and discouraging future violations. Human Rights Watch researchers spent three weeks on the ground, including in Jenin camp, immediately following the operation. Researchers gathered detailed accounts from victims and witnesses, carefully corroborating and independently crosschecking their accounts with those of others to reconstruct a detailed picture of events in the camp in April 2002. The findings were published in a 52-page report, """"Jenin: IDF Military Operations."""" In early May, the Israel Defense Forces made a commitment to investigate every incident documented in the report. To date, Human Rights Watch has had no response from the IDF as to the progress of any such investigations.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","United Nations"

More recently, the flood of weapons has spilled back into Kenya, making the resort to violence more likely -- and more deadly. The spread of small arms and patterns of election-year ethnic violence threaten to endanger human rights as the country gears up for the next round of elections, anticipated for late 2002.   Human Rights Watch's report """"Playing with Fire: Weapons Proliferation, Political Violence, and Human Rights in Kenya"""" documents the dangerous nexus between arms availability and ethnic attacks in Kenya. It highlights politically instigated armed violence on Kenya's coast during the last general election cycle, in 1997. More than 100 people were killed and over 100,000 people displaced in weeks of attacks in a quiet resort area.   The report includes first-hand testimony from perpetrators of the attacks who said they were backed by ruling party politicians. They gave detailed accounts of how they were recruited, armed, trained, and led to attack ethnic communities that were viewed as likely opposition voters in the 1997 elections.   From 1998 to 1999 a government commission of inquiry in Kenya known as the Akiwumi Commission examined that and other cases of inter-ethnic violence, including other incidents attributed to the ruling party. Its report, issued nearly three years ago, has yet to be made public. The release of the HRW report helped spark renewed debate in Kenya about the impunity for those who have fomented ethnic violence. It was followed by renewed calls for the release of the Akiwumi report in the media, in parliamentary debate, and by civil society groups.    The HRW report was launched with a press conference in Nairobi on May 31. It was covered extensively by the Kenyan media and international press, including the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune, BBC World Service, VOA, AP, Reuters, and AFP.","Africa, Kenya","Arms"

The first of the two executions, that of T.J. Jones, is scheduled for August 8. Jones was convicted in 1994 of a murder committed in the course of a carjacking when he was 17. Because he has asked his attorney not to pursue further appeals or seek clemency, his execution next week is all but certain. Toronto Patterson, the second juvenile offender scheduled for execution this month, was also convicted of murder at the age of 17. His death sentence will be carried out on August 28 unless he is granted a reprieve. Texas executes far more juvenile offenders than any other state. Of the 19 juvenile offenders put to death nationwide since 1976, when executions resumed after a three-year moratorium, 11 were from Texas. The most recent execution was that of Napoleon Beazley, who was put to death in May despite pleas for clemency by the judge who presided over his trial and Archbishop Desmond Tutu, among others. Just six other states have carried out such executions in the past 26 years. Of those states, only Virginia has executed more than one juvenile offender. Virginia has put three juvenile offenders to death, two in 2000 and one in 1998. Even in Texas, lawmakers are having second thoughts about allowing juvenile offenders to be put to death. In the last legislative session, a measure that would have risen the minimum age for capital punishment to 18 passed in the Texas House of Representatives and would have been approved by the state Senate if Gov. Perry had not threatened to veto it. Indiana abolished the death penalty for juvenile offenders this year, and Montana did the same in 1999. Similar measures are being considered in at least nine other states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania and South Carolina. """"Texas is out of step with the rest of the country,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of going forward with these executions, it's time for the state to rethink this barbaric practice."""" In a related case in June, the U.S. Supreme Court found that the execution of offenders with mental retardation was unconstitutional, reasoning that a national consensus had developed against it. The Court noted that 18 states and the federal government prohibited such executions. Sixteen states and the federal government set 18 as the minimum age for the death penalty. Another 12 states do not permit capital punishment under any circumstances. The rising number of states that bar the execution of juvenile offenders and the rarity of such executions in states that do permit them makes it likely that the court will address the issue in the near future. In fact, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens told a gathering of federal judges in July that the execution of juvenile offenders could be the next major capital punishment issue decided by the Supreme Court. Stevens was the author of the court's ruling on the execution of persons with mental retardation. Elsewhere in the world, only Congo and Iran are known to have executed juvenile offenders in the last three years. Each now explicitly repudiates the practice, making the United States the only country that continues to claim the legal authority to execute juvenile offenders. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty under all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights"

Secretary Powell will make his first official visit to Indonesia on August 2, where he will meet with President Megawati Sukarnoputri and Cabinet officials, including Security Minister Bambang Yudhoyono. Powell should make clear that the U.S. support for the Indonesian military will be strictly conditioned on human rights progress,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"Removing restrictions on cooperation with the Indonesian armed forces will undercut those working for reform. If Secretary Powell goes ahead, the United States will strengthen the military at the expense of civilian institutions, and send the wrong signal to Indonesia's leaders.""""  Some supporters of increasing U.S.-Indonesian military ties claim that it will encourage reform and respect for human rights. But decades of U.S. support for the Soeharto-era armed forces had no such effect, Human Rights Watch said, and it is unlikely that any amount of foreign military training or exposure to democratic institutions abroad will change the military's behavior in the absence of effective civilian control and accountability for serious abuses.  """"Some argue that Indonesia's cooperation in the war on terror means the United States must support the Indonesian military, no matter what,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"But until the Indonesian armed forces demonstrate commitment to accountability and civilian control, they will be an unreliable partner in fighting terrorism.""""  There are widespread allegations that elements of the Indonesian armed forces helped create and train radical Indonesian Muslim organizations. The army has certainly done very little to rein them in. For example, the Indonesian military allowed the most prominent such group, Laskar Jihad, to operate freely in conflict areas such as Central Sulawesi and the Malukus.  There are credible and widespread reports of biased interventions by army units and leakage of military weapons from security forces in the provinces of Maluku and North Maluku that have helped fuel communal violence.  Human Rights Watch also urged Secretary Powell to demonstrate his support for civilian institutions by meeting with leading human rights non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and with members of the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission (Komnas-Ham).  """"Powell should indicate strong U.S. support for the rebuilding of civilian institutions,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"That could include the Indonesian police, which have been separated from the military since April 1999.""""  During last September's visit to Washington by President Megawati Sukarnoputri, the Bush Administration lifted an embargo on sales of non-lethal commercial arms to Indonesia and resumed a high-level defense dialogue, as well as various bilateral and multilateral exchanges involving Indonesian military officers. However, under the Leahy amendment in the FY 2002 foreign aid bill, certain human rights conditions must be met before the administration can provide International Military Education and Training (IMET) to Indonesia or sell U.S.-funded arms and arms supplies. The new FY 2003 bill is currently under consideration in Congress.  The Senate Appropriations Committee removed any restrictions on IMET, but the legislation maintains human rights conditions on U.S. government-funded arms transfers as well as lethal commercial weapons and supplies. Senate floor action is expected in September. The House has not yet acted on the bill.  Anti-terrorism legislation passed by both houses of Congress on July 25, 2002 (supplemental 2002 foreign appropriations bill) provides $16 million to the Indonesian police, including $12 million to establish an anti-terrorism unit in the police.

The euphoria that immediately followed her freedom has now faded. But this week's visit to Burma by United Nations special envoy Razali Ismail opens the door for progress toward restoring democratic, civilian rule and basic human rights. After nearly 20 months under house arrest, Ms. Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, emerged with a clear agenda for next steps. These included release of all political prisoners, immediate talks to continue political dialogue between the NLD and the ruling State Peace and Development Council and movement from """"confidence building"""" gestures to discussions about a transition process. But the secret two-way dialogue, begun in October 2000, is in limbo. There has been no word of further talks since Ms. Suu Kyi's release, and at the time neither she nor the government announced an agreed upon schedule for the dialogue. Nor did Ambassador Razali publicly suggest a timeframe for further talks. At a U.N. press briefing, he insisted that the SPDC's leaders are committed to """"make the transition from military government to civilian constitutional government,"""" without hinting at any road map for when or how that might take place. More than 300 political prisoners, including NLD activists and members of parliament, have been freed; including 32 who were released in advance of Ambassador Razali's mission. But hundreds more are still imprisoned. Overall human-rights conditions in Burma remain dreadful, with severe restrictions on political freedoms and continued use of forced labor, torture, child soldiers and other serious abuses. However, it would be a mistake to assume that nothing has changed in the last three months, or that the situation is back to square one. In some ways, Ms. Suu Kyi's release is simply the tip of the iceberg. Above and below the surface, internal and external factors are at work that could result in at least some incremental progress, facilitated by Ambassador Razali's Aug. 2-6 visit. Both the government and the opposition have been testing each other, cautiously measuring each other's intentions, as well as the level of suspicion and mistrust between them. Closing the confidence gap remains a key objective. Twice since May, Ms. Suu Kyi has left her compound and traveled outside of Rangoon. An attempt to travel into the Burmese countryside triggered her confinement back in 2000, but during her most recent forays to meet with NLD supporters and ethnic minority groups, the government did nothing to intervene. In late July, she was greeted by a crowd of thousands in Moulmein, southeast of Rangoon, where she opened an NLD office and publicly renewed her call for democracy. No doubt the military finds this kind of open political activity alarming and potentially threatening. But the cautious tone and pace of Ms. Suu Kyi's reemergence on the Burmese stage seems designed to reassure the SPDC, as she also signals her desire to resume a private dialogue. Ambassador Razali must now build on these recent developments, pushing the SPDC to expand the space for the NLD and other opposition groups to operate, without fear of retaliation or punishment. Persuading Rangoon to allow more NLD township offices to reopen would be a clear step forward, as well as getting agreement on a general amnesty for all political prisoners. But the U.N. must also refuse to be coopted, and avoid cosmetic gestures aimed mainly at improving Burma's international image. The SPDC's invitation last week to Sergio Vieira de Mello, the newly appointed U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, to visit the country was premature and ill timed. Mr. de Mello won't even be officially confirmed in the position until September, and in any case, he shouldn't consider going to Rangoon unless a visit would have concrete results. Externally, the Burmese government is dealing with a more complex international environment than it faced prior to Ms. Suu Kyi's release. Her freedom raised expectations of more to come. If the SPDC does nothing to deliver on those expectations, it risks losing any possibility of establishing more normal relations with the outside world or obtaining the aid and investment the country desperately needs. A recent assessment mission to Burma by the International Monetary Fund found a troubled economy and deteriorating social conditions. No Western government has announced plans to lift sanctions on economic or military ties with Burma, but there are some expanded opportunities for humanitarian assistance. By taking positive steps to improve human rights and resume the dialogue, the SPDC can greatly improve the climate for such assistance. At a U.S. Congressional hearing on June 29, the U.S. State Department said that American sanctions would remain in place, but """"significant reform and improvement in observance in human rights will spur a positive response."""" At the same hearing, an official from the U.S. Agency for International Development described plans for spending $1 million in the current fiscal year's budget on a limited program for HIV/AIDS inside Burma, delivered through NGOs and U.N. agencies and administered in consultation with the NLD. The U.S. might give more aid after receiving a report from a field mission to Burma by the Centers for Disease Control. This two-track American approach -- keeping sanctions but increasing targeted humanitarian aid -- makes sense, and enjoys bipartisan congressional support. The European Union has adopted a similar posture, maintaining sanctions while exploring possibilities for increased humanitarian assistance and providing funds to deal with Burma's urgent HIV/AIDS crisis. But Japan, once Burma's largest bilateral aid donor, has gone further. After Ms. Suu Kyi's release, Tokyo disbursed $4.9 million of a $29 million Official Development Assistance loan approved earlier for renovation of a hydroelectric power plant in eastern Burma. This was a mistake, since Tokyo should not have taken such a step without first receiving assurances that the aid would trigger concrete human-rights progress. New ODA to Burma for infrastructure projects had been suspended since 1988. In a major political gesture, Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi will visit Burma from August 3-5, the first visit by a Japanese foreign minister in 20 years. She will meet with military leaders to urge progress in the dialogue, and may also see Ms. Suu Kyi. Such a meeting would clearly be useful. Ms. Kawaguchi should express firm support for Ambassador Razali's mission, but not give the ruling generals any promises of additional ODA absent significant changes on the ground. Both the Japanese foreign minister and U.N. envoy should raise, in their talks with the SPDC, the serious problems of Burma's ethnic minorities, whose representatives are not yet included in the dialogue. Ambassador Razali should discuss the persecution of Burma's Muslim population, enduring the aftermath of violent confrontations with Buddhists last year in eastern Burma and in Arakan state, near the Bangladesh border. Not only did the authorities fail to intervene quickly to stop beatings and deaths and the destruction of Muslim shops, homes and mosques, but there were credible reports in some cities outside Rangoon of military intelligence officers stirring up anti-Muslim violence. A key factor behind the violence was the destruction of Buddhist statues by the Taliban in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in March 2001, fueling resentment against local Muslims. Ambassador Razali should try to meet with Muslim residents and leaders, including in areas hit by the violence. The day she was freed, Ms. Suu Kyi said her release marked a """"new dawn for the country."""" Perhaps. Pressures for change have certainly grown since her previous release from house arrest in 1995. Ambassador Razali must somehow restore the sense of momentum that existed in May, tempered with a realistic assessment of how far Burma still has to go.

Cobban argues that criminal prosecutions are a """"strait-jacket"""" solution imposed from outside Rwanda. But the Rwandan government itself initially requested the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (though it later opposed it) and decided on national trials for the more than 100,000 jailed in Rwanda on charges of genocide. Its preference for prosecution is understandable: both before and during the colonial period, Rwandan authorities judged major crimes in formal proceedings and imposed punishment on those found guilty.   Cobban favors a more """"restorative"""" solution like the gacaca system, a traditional Rwandan procedure for solving local problems. As Cobban's own example (a dispute over $10) shows, gacaca traditionally deals with minor issues not involving criminal responsibility, one reason why the Rwandan minister of justice originally rejected its use in genocide cases.   The Rwandan government has now decided to use a form of gacaca for the cases of all but the accused ringleaders of the genocide. But as Rwandan Ambassador Sezibera told Cobban, these are """"gacaca courts, not just plain gacaca."""" Cobban claims that """"human rights organizations"""" oppose gacaca-true neither of Human Rights Watch nor of Rwandan organizations. We do, however, protest that """"gacaca courts"""" - no longer community-based conflict-resolution mechanisms, but parts of a centrally-organized state initiative - put the investigative power of the state at the service of the prosecution while prohibiting legal assistance for the accused.   In addition, gacaca will examine only the genocide, not the contemporaneous killings committed by soldiers of the Rwandan Patriotic Front that now controls the government. This same failing, to date, leads to the charge of """"victors' justice"""" that Cobban cites against the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.   Cobban's analysis is most troubling when she resorts to medical metaphor. She acknowledges the planning and organization of the genocide by state authorities, detailing how killers coolly and regularly slaughtered Tutsis as daily """"work."""" Yet in her view, these were not horrible crimes but a """"social psychosis,"""" not acts of volition but a """"collective frenzy""""; the architects of the genocide are not more culpable than ordinary killers but """"sicker.""""   Cobban's analysis resembles that of the perpetrators themselves. They argued that the slaughter was """"spontaneous,"""" committed by people driven mad out of fear and anger. Rwandan killers have indeed been traumatized but their ailment resulted from their conduct rather than causing it.   Mob psychology cannot explain choices made during the genocide: why some individuals killed for reward or pleasure, or from fear of punishment, while others did not. To judge the killers as merely """"sick"""" devalues the courage and decency of the millions who resisted this inhumanity, sometimes at the cost of their lives.   Cobban's medical metaphor allows no place for individual responsibility. A person plagued by cancer is a victim of unfortunate circumstance, but is not at fault. Murderers, let alone orchestrators of genocide, are different. When they corral victims into churches and stadiums and systematically slaughter them with guns and machetes, the killers are not the latest hapless victims of the genocidal flu. They are deliberate, immoral actors. Treating them as no more culpable than children who refuse to wear coats and catch cold is both wrong and dangerous. Wrong because it does a deep disservice to the victims, as if their deaths were a natural accident, not a deliberate choice. Dangerous because it signals to other would-be mass murderers that they risk not punishment but, at most, communal therapy sessions.   Cobban proposes healing rituals, such as those used after the Mozambican war, as a way to restore individuals and societies to health. Such rituals have no equivalent in Rwanda; but, of course, other non-judicial initiatives can and should be used to promote reconciliation. Contrary to Cobban's claim, prosecutions do not exclude other alternatives. Burundi, for example, plans both a truth and reconciliation commission and investigations that may lead to national and international prosecution.   Cobban speaks highly of Mozambique's grant of a blanket amnesty to all human rights abusers, asserting that it has led to some years of peace. But countless other cases show that it is more usual for such impunity to breed violence. In Sierra Leone, for example, the amnesty granted in the 1999 Lomé peace accord reinforced the Revolutionary United Front in its methods of amputation, rape, and murder, and condemned the country to many further atrocities.   Aware of the troubling implications of her prescriptions, Cobban insists she is not """"attempting to undermine the norms of individual responsibility"""" but only trying to distinguish between """"policy responses"""" in normal times and those after times of atrocity. In the latter case, she believes, """"punishment should be only a small (or even non-existent) part of the response"""" directed at the highest levels and meant for """"incapacitation""""-to avoid the leadership regrouping. For this, """"a limited number of more or less summary executions,"""" apparently without the fault-finding or truth-telling of a genuine trial, would suffice.   But it is precisely at a time of atrocities - or when a tyrant contemplates committing atrocities - that a policy of trial and punishment is essential. Justice reinforces social norms and deters some would-be perpetrators. True, until recently, tyrants could reliably avoid justice by using violence and intimidation to shut down their national courts. The threat of international prosecution, as an alternative, did not exist. But just as international justice is becoming an occasional reality, just as tyrants must think twice before committing horrendous crimes, Cobban offers her therapeutic dodge, her sick-man's excuse to responsibility.   As the International Criminal Court is born, giving hope of more effective international prosecution of the most heinous human rights crimes, one can only imagine the long line of perpetrators who would choose therapy instead of prison cells. Before we agree to counseling instead of punishment, we owe it to the victims of the Rwandan genocide - and to all future victims of genocide - to contemplate Cobban's theory from their perspective.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/31/indonesia-megawatis-administration-yet-reform-military","Indonesia- Megawatis Administration Yet to Reform Military","Indonesia: Megawati's Administration Yet to Reform Military","","07/31/2002","After one year in office, President Megawati's administration has restored a degree of political stability in Indonesia. But her efforts to secure support and stability have led to a retrenchment of many of the old interests of the Soeharto regime that ruled for three decades, most notably the military. The last year has seen a resurgent military, while half-hearted judicial measures against corruption and human rights abuses have only demonstrated the level of impunity. Megawati's administration has yet to deal effectively with problems of military reform, the ongoing violence in conflict areas such as Aceh and Papua, and attacks on human rights defenders. These issues should all be on Secretary Powell's agenda. Lack of military reform There were some tentative reform measures under Presidents Habibie and Wahid, such as separating the police from the military and reducing the army's political role. However following the turmoil that ousted Wahid in July of 2001, Megawati has increasingly looked to the military for support. The institution has enjoyed a resurgence in influence, including new commands, impunity for human rights abusers, and weakening civilian control. The territorial command structure, the architecture of the military's domestic security role that posts soldiers all the way down to the village level, has only been strengthened, with new regional commands created in Aceh and Maluku. Army chief of staff General Ryamizard Ryacudu recently condemned proponents of reforming this structure: """"This is not the time to be talking about getting rid of or not getting rid of the territorial commands. It is irrelevant. What I would like to see are some intelligent and clear thoughts and ideas about how expansive a role should be entrusted to the territorial commands in safeguarding integrity, regional unity, and the safety of the nation now and into the future."""" Rather than being prosecuted, officers implicated in human rights violations have frequently been promoted. Retired Lt. General Hendropriyono, known as the Butcher of Lampung for his role in a 1989 massacre, was named National Intelligence Chief despite his suspected role in funding the Timorese militias. Major-General Sjafrie Syamsoeddin received the key post of military spokesman despite his role as Jakarta military commander during bloody 1998 riots that ultimately brought down Soeharto. More than a thousand civilians died in the riots, and several students disappeared or were shot by snipers thought to be members of the police or military. And Major-General Mahidin Simbolon, an officer linked to the creation of the Timorese militias, was promoted to Regional Commander for Papua, where there are recent reports of militia activity. The military has thumbed its nose at civilian control by ignoring summons by the National Human Rights Commission investigating the 1998 killings of students. Deployments and strategies in Aceh and Papua reportedly lack the civilian input required by recent laws. East Timor Trials in Jakarta Trials are underway of 18 military, police, government and militia leaders in Jakarta before special ad hoc human rights tribunals. But domestic and international organizations observing the process have excoriated the indictments and prosecution for ignoring the most serious and significant criminal offenses. Most charges are limited to the army's failure to intervene in a supposed civil conflict, overlooking the widely accepted role of the army in creating, arming, and directing the militia campaign of terror. The weak prosecution and unchallenged statements of defense witnesses have if anything reinforced the army's version of events in Indonesia. Many high-ranking suspects were never charged at all, ignoring documentary evidence and the recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission and other investigators. These include Generals Wiranto and Zacky Anwar Makarim. The first verdict may be handed down as early as Thursday, August 1. Prosecutors have asked for sentences just over the minimum of ten years for the former governor, provincial police chief, and five low-ranking officers linked to the Suai massacre. There are concerns that any convictions or sentences - however token or limited - will be used by supporters of military aid in the U.S. government to justify removing all remaining restrictions on U.S.-Indonesian military cooperation. Armed Conflict in Aceh The government continues to address the long-running conflict in Aceh mainly through a military approach. Both the Indonesian army and the opposition Free Aceh Movement (GAM) have been responsible for serious abuses, including torture, abductions, and extrajudicial executions. The military commander for Aceh, Major-General Djali Jusuf, recently stated """"Of the central government's six programs for Aceh, only the security scheme was implemented. Other matters such as economic and social development have become completely stagnant."""" Talks between the Free Aceh Movement and the government had made some small progress under the mediation of a Swiss organization, the Henry Dunant Centre, with the participation of retired U.S. General Anthony Zinni, an advisor to Secretary Powell. These efforts have been undermined by an aggressive military campaign waged under the authorization of a series of Presidential Instructions beginning in 2001. President Megawati is expected to renew those instructions in August 2002, and some within the military have been pushing for greater authority enshrined in law or a declaration of martial law. The provincial parliament has made little progress in adopting implementing regulations for the Special Autonomy Act, adopted in July 2001. Autonomy measures intended to reduce demands for independence have been largely limited to the imposition of Shariah law, which many Acehnese say they have not asked for and do not want. Decentralization of oil and gas revenues has created new opportunities for corruption at the provincial level. In recent weeks the army has been making moves to obtain a declaration of martial law in the province. After a visit to the region security minister Yudhoyono labeled the rebel group as terrorists, which some saw as an effort to deflect criticism for a coming crackdown. But the governor and Acehnese civil society organizations have come out strongly against martial law. The Regional Commander for Aceh recently stated, """"The risks of implementing martial law are too high. There will be casualties on all sides including civilians and our troops too."""" However there is still support for martial law or civil emergency status, a decision that may be made in August. There are also signs that the army is increasing troop strength even without a formal designation, what some observers have called martial law by stealth. Based on its documentation of the impact of the war on civilians, Human Rights Watch believes that martial law would lead to an increase in military abuses and impunity, and so resentment towards the central government. Legal and judicial reform The Megawati administration has made little headway in reforming Indonesia's corrupt and ineffective legal system. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Independence of Judges and Lawyers, Param Cumaraswamy, told the press during his July visit to Indonesia: """"I didn't realize corruption was so endemic. Practically everyone with whom I discussed the matter admitted the prevalence of corruption in the administration of justice."""" The same week a Jakarta-based NGO called Indonesian Corruption Watch issued a report that described a court mafia of corruption from the lowest court clerk to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, the government's initial response to these critiques has been highly defensive. Until this enormous problem is addressed, Indonesians -and donors and private foreign investors-- will lack confidence in the rule of law in Indonesia. This is a fundamental problem that action on a few high-profile cases will not in itself begin to repair. Human Rights Defenders Well-organized gangs attacked several Jakarta NGOs that had criticized military officials in March of 2002. In conflict areas such as Aceh and Papua, death threats and physical attacks on NGO workers are common. For example, in December 2000 three young field workers for an NGO called Rehabilitation Action for Torture Victims in Aceh (RATA) were killed. An eyewitness named four army informers as the perpetrators but they were later allowed to escape from detention. At the same time, the National Human Rights Commission (Komnas-HAM), a semi-independent body first established by then President Soeharto in 1993, has become increasingly ineffective and marginalized after playing a credible and important role in the Soeharto period. Some crucial investigations have been half-hearted, or never followed up. The parliament recently recommended appointment of new members, but some highly qualified candidates were passed over. Even so the newly formed commission can still carry out investigations and push for prosecutions. For example, the commission last year conducted a preliminary inquiry into the massacre of 31 people at a plantation, Bumi Flora, in East Aceh on August 9, 2001. As of late July 2002 a long-awaited follow-up investigation was underway but had reportedly run into problems due to lack of security. This investigation should be carried out in a comprehensive and transparent manner with results swiftly made public and acted upon with prosecution of those responsible.","",""

The sentence followed the retrial of Ibrahim and twenty-seven others before the Supreme State Security Court. Ibrahim, director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in Cairo, was once again found guilty, including on the count of accepting foreign funds without authorization. Nadia 'Abd al-Nour, the Ibn Khaldun Center's chief accountant, who was originally sentenced to two years of imprisonment on a fraud charge, was handed down the same sentence today. Human Rights Watch called for their immediate and unconditional release, and for Ibrahim to be allowed to travel abroad for urgent medical treatment.  The verdict comes on the heels of a new law of associations passed by the Egyptian parliament last month, giving the authorities draconian powers to dissolve non-governmental organizations (NGOs) by administrative order and without recourse to a court of law, and to interfere unduly in their internal affairs.  Two other Ibn Khaldun employees who had earlier received two-year prison terms for fraud, Khaled al-Fayyad and Usama Hammad 'Ali, received one-year suspended sentences on this occasion and are expected to be released shortly.  Two defendants sentenced in the original trial to five-year prison terms on separate bribery and forgery charges, Magda Ibrahim al-Bey and Muhammad Hassanein 'Amara, were sentenced on retrial to three years of imprisonment. The remaining original sentences against twenty-one other defendants who had been handed down one-year suspended sentences remained unchanged, as did a two-year prison sentence passed in absentia on another defendant, Marwa Ibrahim Zaki.  """"The retrial of Ibrahim and his co-defendants was as manifestly unfair as the original trial,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"The guilty verdict has done nothing to dispel our conviction that the case against Ibrahim and his colleagues has been politically motivated from the start.""""  As in the original trial, the defense team was denied adequate time to prepare its case, and some defense lawyers have stated that they were denied access to certain key documents altogether. The presiding judges, as in the original trial, consistently failed to respond to applications by defense lawyers for leave to challenge the constitutionality of the legislation under which two of the charges against Ibrahim were brought.  The presiding judge also failed to respond to pleas for proceedings to be suspended to enable Ibrahim to travel abroad for medical treatment. Ibrahim suffers from a degenerative neurological condition and his health has deteriorated significantly during his incarceration. Appeals to the Egyptian authorities to lift the travel ban imposed on Ibrahim prior to the start of this second trial fell on deaf ears.  The judges' written ruling, detailing the reasoning behind their verdict, must be issued within thirty days of the conclusion of the trial, after which the defendants are given up to two months in which to lodge an appeal.  Contrary to international standards for fair trial, the Ibn Khaldun defendants were denied the right to appeal against the original verdict on points of substance. Their challenge before the Court of Cassation was restricted to procedural points. However, according to Egyptian law, an appeal against this second verdict can be mounted on the substance of the case as well as on points of law.  Background  Saadeddin Ibrahim, a sociology professor at the American University in Cairo, was director of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies until its closure by the Egyptian government in June 2000. The center's activities ranged from minority rights to civic empowerment, including voter registration campaigns and election monitoring.  In May 2001, the Supreme State Security Court sentenced Ibrahim to seven years in prison and six co-defendants to prison terms ranging from two to five years with labor. Twenty-one other defendants were handed down one-year suspended sentences and released. The authorities shut down both the Ibn Khaldun Center and an affiliated organization promoting women's voting rights, the Hoda Association. On appeal, the Court of Cassation ordered a retrial, which opened before the Supreme State Security Court on April 27, 2002.  Ibrahim was first arrested on June 30, 2000, together with two of his associates, Nadia 'Abd al-Nour and Usama Hammad Ali. Others were detained over the following days. They were held in detention without charge and interrogated for up to six weeks and then released on bail. None of those who had been detained was charged, but an unspecified case against them remained """"pending.""""  At the time of the arrests, the Ibn Khaldun Center was working on a voter education project and a project to monitor upcoming parliamentary elections. In September 2000, immediately after Ibrahim announced that he intended to proceed with the Center's plans to monitor and report on Egypt's forthcoming national elections, which were held in October and November 2000, state authorities formally charged Ibrahim and his colleagues and referred the case to the Supreme State Security Court.  The trial opened on November 18, 2000, and concluded on May 21, 2001. Ibrahim was convicted of receiving donations without prior official permission, disseminating false information designed to undermine Egypt's stature abroad, and defrauding the European Union. Four of his associates were convicted of assisting in the perpetration of fraud. All five were acquitted of the conspiracy to commit bribery. Two others, a one-time employee and a policeman, were convicted of offering and accepting bribes and forging official documents.  Human Rights Watch monitored the trial closely. It concluded that the trial was manifestly unfair at all stages of the proceedings, and that the court undermined the ability of the defendants and their lawyers to mount an effective defense. The defense was denied access to key documents, and to the prosecution memorandum detailing its case against the defendants, until four months into the trial. When access to thousands of pages of documents was finally granted to defense lawyers, it was limited to a single session of several hours, and permission to photocopy any documents was denied. The minutes of the trial proceedings were incomplete, and defense lawyers were denied access to official summaries of proceedings. The presiding judge consistently failed to respond to defense challenges of constitutionality of relevant statutes, and to consider all documentation submitted on behalf of the defendants prior to reaching their verdicts.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

Risks Abusing Rights in China","Human Rights Watch Letter to Terry Semel ","07/30/2002","Terry Semel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Yahoo! Inc. 701 First Avenue Sunnyvale, California 94089  Dear Mr. Semel: We are writing to express our deep concern at news that Yahoo! Inc. has signed the """"Public Pledge on Self-discipline for the Chinese Internet Industry"""" sponsored by the Internet Society of China, a government-affiliated organization.  Yahoo has been a leader in bringing the Internet to millions of people in China. Yahoo's e-mail, online forums, and other publicly accessible services have enabled millions of global users to communicate within and outside of their countries. By agreeing to the pledge, Yahoo threatens to undermine the positive potential of the Internet in China. Were Yahoo to implement its provisions, it could become complicit in violations of the right to free expression. Yahoo would be seen in China and around the world not so much as a portal offering access to new ideas, but as a gatekeeper for an oppressive government.  In recent months, the Internet Society of China has encouraged Internet businesses, government units and research institutes around China to sign on to this standard. While signing the pledge is not required by law, it is, along with China's many restrictive Internet laws, another repressive measure against China's rapidly growing virtual community.  By agreeing to the pledge, Yahoo is facilitating censorship by the government. The vague language of the pledge would appear to require Yahoo to identify and prevent the transmission of virtually any information that Chinese authorities or companies deem objectionable. Signatories agree to """"[r]efrain from producing, posting or disseminating harmful information that may jeopardize state security and disrupt social stability, contravene laws and regulations and spread superstition and obscenity."""" Signatories must also """"monitor the information publicized by users on websites according to law and remove the harmful information promptly""""; and """"[r]efrain from establishing links to the Web sites that contain harmful information so as to ensure that the content of the network information is lawful and healthy."""" There is no definition as to what constitutes """"harmful information.""""  The government of the People's Republic of China systematically restricts freedom of expression. The China Democracy Party, an opposition political party formed within China, has been restricted, and its leaders arrested or forced to flee the country. Since 1989, student activists around the country calling for greater democratization and transparency have received prison sentences ranging from ten years to life. Chinese ethnic and religious minority activists who call for genuine autonomy or separatism, such as Tibetan Buddhists and Uighur Muslims, are routinely jailed. In Chinese prisons and labor camps all such political prisoners are often mistreated, denied medical treatment, and even tortured or executed. In China, in short, any public expression of views that differ from those of the state, and provision of information not deemed politically acceptable, may be considered """"harmful"""" and may result in a prison sentence. There is a strong likelihood that Yahoo will assist in furthering such human rights violations.  China is a signatory to, though it has yet to ratify, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 19 of the Covenant states that """"Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice."""" Any restriction on expression or on information must be prescribed by law. National security restrictions must have a genuine purpose and demonstrable effect of protecting a legitimate national security interest. The restriction imposed must be the least restrictive means possible for protecting that interest and must be compatible with democratic principles. In effect, the pledge places the burden on companies such as Yahoo to enforce the Chinese government's standards on freedom of expression.  We understand that Yahoo is obliged to abide by laws in countries where it does business, but Yahoo should make it a point to do everything in its power to avoid affirmatively endorsing insidious censorship practices. Signing the Public Pledge flies in the face of this principle. Yahoo should immediately and publicly clarify that it will abide by internationally recognized free expression standards, and that it will take no actions pursuant to the Pledge inconsistent with those standards. Yahoo should also clarify that if the only way to do business in China is to be complicit with government censorship, it will stop doing business there.  Were Yahoo to face demands to accept similarly restrictive standards in the United States or Europe, we are certain that you would do everything in your power to resist them, and that you would look to others to support your right to be free from censorship. Indeed, in April 2001, Human Rights Watch joined many other organizations in an amicus curiae brief standing by Yahoo when its Website was sued over its content.  Yahoo's image as an irreverent and open forum for free exchange is starkly contradicted by its willingness to abide by the repressive standards of the public pledge. As a standard bearer in an industry that depends on the free flow of ideas, it is not in Yahoo's interest to develop a split personality: innovative and open in the West, but tolerant of unlawful intrusions on expression in the East.  The pledge is an inappropriate commitment for an industry leader to undertake. We strongly urge Yahoo to withdraw from it. In the meantime, Yahoo should clarify its position on the censorship of Internet content to its users and the public in the interest of full disclosure, so that consumers can decide whether they wish to support such practices. In particular, users of Yahoo's Chinese-language website should be clearly informed what information will be monitored, what information will be excluded, and what will be reported to authorities.  On Friday, we contacted Yahoo several times by phone to request a meeting in order to discuss Yahoo's position in China, but received no response. We would greatly appreciate an opportunity to discuss this matter with you directly, and look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

Secretary Powell will travel to Pakistan this week as part of a larger trip to Asia, during which he will meet with senior officials to discuss key bilateral, regional and global issues.  """"This is an enormous opportunity for Secretary Powell to push for accountability for women's rights abuses and adherence to democratic principles,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch.  In a July 18, 2002 letter to Secretary Powell, Human Rights Watch said that the Pakistani government's response to continuing violence and discrimination against women has been inadequate and that the government should repeal discriminatory provisions of the 1979 Hudood Ordinances that impede and discourage women from seeking justice. The Hudood Ordinances, which criminalize adultery and fornication, are frequently used to prosecute victims of rape.  Although Pakistani law enforcement agents arrested some of the perpetrators in a recent, widely reported gang rape case, and an investigation is underway, Human Rights Watch said that police misconduct in the case and the excessive authority of tribal councils in Pakistan need to be addressed. The case involved the rape by four men of Mukhtaran Bibi, a Pakistani woman, during a tribal council meeting in southern Punjab on June 22, 2002. The rape, which occurred in the presence of a large number of villagers, was intended as """"punishment"""" for the conduct of her brother, who had been seen with an unchaperoned woman from another tribe.  Secretary Powell should also advise Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf against amending the Pakistani constitution unilaterally, Human Rights Watch said.  Musharraf's recently proposed amendments to the constitution would significantly strengthen the power of the presidency, formalize the army's role in governance, and diminish the authority of elected representatives. The amendments would circumscribe freedom of association and the right of individuals to stand for elected office, limiting the opportunity for moderate voices representing the majority of Pakistani citizens to exercise political leadership.","Asia, United States, Pakistan","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/23/afghanistan-unsafe-refugee-returns","Afghanistan Unsafe for Refugee Returns","Afghanistan Unsafe for Refugee Returns","U.N. Refugee Agency Sending """"Misleading"""" Message","07/23/2002","(New York) - The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) should reverse its newly-announced policy of promoting voluntary repatriation to Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said today. UNHCR issued a statement last week advising governments hosting Afghan refugees to offer incentives and assistance to all who wish to repatriate, and to resume processing the applications of Afghans with pending asylum claims.  """"By advocating for repatriation, UNHCR is sending the message to governments that conditions in Afghanistan are sufficiently stable for a large-scale return,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch. """"This is misleading and is contradicted by conditions on the ground.""""  Human Rights Watch investigations in recent months have found that conditions inside Afghanistan are still extremely unstable and that risk of persecution exists for certain groups. Continuing factional rivalry between General Abdul Rashid Dostum's Junbish forces and General Atta Mohammad's Jamiat troops has created a security vacuum in northern Afghanistan, leading to a rise in attacks on humanitarian aid agencies and Afghan civilians. Armed conflict between the two factions has increased over a wider area of the north in recent weeks, affecting at least four different districts during the week of July 8.  At the same time, ethnic Pashtuns, a minority in the north, continue to flee targeted violence, rapes of women and children, seizure of farmland and demands of money by local commanders in Farah and Faryab province. Human Rights Watch has also documented ongoing lawlessness and abuses by warlord forces in the south and west of the country.  In recent statements, UNHCR has cautioned governments not to rush repatriation before conditions are stabilized in Afghanistan - in direct contrast to its most recent position. On July 2, UNHCR announced that it was suspending assisted returns from Herat to Faryab and Samangan provinces and to parts of Balkh province in northern Afghanistan, because of continued insecurity. In May 2002, the UNHCR spokesperson in Kabul, Yusuf Hassan, called on governments not to put undue pressure on Afghanistan by prematurely promoting repatriation.  """"UNHCR has itself admitted that conditions are unsafe in parts of Afghanistan. So why advocate for refugees to return now?"""" said Reilly.  UNHCR has suggested that if Afghans with pending asylum claims are encouraged to voluntarily repatriate, it would relieve the pressure on asylum systems. But Human Rights Watch said this argument plays into the hands of governments such as Australia and the United Kingdom that are already putting pressure on Afghan refugees to return. Australia, for example, has begun making unqualified statements that Afghan refugees, recognized under the Refugee Convention but only given Temporary Protection Visas, will have to go home when those visas expire or may even face cancellation of their visas. The Australian government is currently offering Afghan detainees 28 days to accept financial incentives to return while threatening that they will have to go back without the money if their asylum claims are rejected.  In addition to the security problems facing returnees, many were not in fact returning to their homes but merely becoming internally displaced in urban centers like Kabul and Herat, contributing to the existing strain on infrastructure and resources, Human Rights Watch said.  """"There are serious doubts about the absorption capacity of Afghanistan and whether humanitarian agencies have the funding and resources to cope with the large-scale returns that UNHCR is promoting,"""" said Reilly.  On July 11, the chair of the 15-nation Afghanistan Support Group meeting in Geneva noted a budgetary shortfall of $777 million for reconstruction and rehabilitation and described the situation in Afghanistan as """"fragile."""" UNHCR also announced that 25 percent of its $271-million aid operation for Afghanistan was not funded and that it still needed $70 million.  Former U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata, has also raised concerns about the speed of refugee returns, especially from Pakistan. Ogata, who addressed the Security Council on July 19 following a visit to Afghanistan, said the scale of the return """"could overwhelm the absorptive capacity of receiving communities,"""" which """"could have grave implications for the security environment as well as the political stability of Afghanistan.""""  Human Rights Watch is also concerned that increasing harassment, arbitrary arrests and detention in Pakistan, combined with lack of assistance for Afghans, could be pushing refugees to return and undermining the voluntariness of their decisions.  Human Rights Watch called on UNHCR to postpone its promotion of voluntary repatriation to Afghanistan. UNHCR's own guidelines state that voluntary repatriation should not be promoted unless """"the large majority of refugees"""" can return """"in safety and with dignity"""" and the country of origin has """"provided a formal guarantee, or adequate assurances for the safety of repatriation refugees.""""  """"These preconditions clearly have not been met in Afghanistan,"""" said Reilly.","Asia, Afghanistan","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/23/letter-us-assistant-secretary-state-africa-walter-kansteiner-regarding-nigeria-and","Letter to US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter Kansteiner Regarding Nigeria and Angola","Letter to US Assistant Secretary of State for Africa Walter Kansteiner Regarding Nigeria and Angola","","07/23/2002","Dear Secretary Kansteiner:   Human Rights Watch welcomes your upcoming visit to Nigeria and Angola. We are writing to raise your attention to human rights concerns in both countries, and to urge your delegation to raise these concerns in your meetings with the Nigerian and Angolan government authorities.  Nigeria  Pre-Election Violence   One of the main concerns for the rest of 2002 and 2003 is the likely increase in political violence in the period leading up to elections. Local elections scheduled for August 2002 and state and presidential elections scheduled for 2003 have already created a sharp increase in political tension and political party infighting, as well as actual violence. In recent weeks, in the context of primaries for the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) at the local level, there have been a series of attacks, primarily carried out by thugs hired by rival candidates. These have resulted in several deaths and serious injuries, in different parts of the country, particularly in some of the southern states. This is just the first stage, so unless effective measures are taken promptly to bring those responsible to account, it is likely the violence will increase as the political stakes rise.   President Olusegun Obasanjo has put forward a bill outlawing political violence. However, this initiative, as well as general statements by federal government officials condemning acts of violence, appear to be ignored at the local level and are seen by many Nigerians simply as measures to pacify international opinion.   There has also been much controversy over the electoral bill and the restrictions on the number of political parties allowed to register for elections. After much heated discussion, three additional parties were allowed to register, bringing the total to six, but many parties that were not allowed to register are complaining bitterly about the arbitrariness and lack of transparency in the Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) decision-making process.   Human Rights Watch urges you to publicly call for free and fair elections and for the government to take steps to prevent further human rights abuses, before the situation escalates out of control. The Nigerian government and judiciary should be urged to ensure that individuals responsible for ordering or carrying out acts of political violence and intimidation are brought to justice promptly.   Vigilante Violence and the Need for Police Reform   Vigilante violence, and political use of vigilante groups, is likely to increase in the run-up to elections. Research by Human Rights Watch in the southeast of Nigeria uncovered serious human rights abuses by the vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys, active in Anambra, Abia and Imo states. The Bakassi Boys have been responsible for public and very brutal executions, systematic torture and unlawful arrests and detentions, often with the active support of state government authorities. Those targeted have included opponents of state governments. Likewise in the southwest, the O'odua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba ethnic militia group that has also taken on vigilante functions, has been responsible for repeated acts of violence, including killings of unarmed civilians. In the north, vigilante groups are sometimes used to enforce the application of Sharia law.   Clashes between vigilante groups and the police are already occurring. The emergence of these groups is clearly linked to the dramatic inadequacy of the national law enforcement agencies, especially the police force. Long-awaited reforms of the police force should be a priority of the government, but these reforms, like any training provided by foreign governments, should ensure practical application of human rights standards as a central component. The Nigerian police force continues to be responsible for systematic and widespread human rights violations. Measures taken so far, such as the recent introduction of """"Operation Fire for Fire"""", appear designed to increase rather than reduce the likelihood of further human rights violations by the police, and have already resulted in further extrajudicial executions and excessive uses of force.    Human Rights Watch urges your delegation to call on the Nigerian government authorities to take measures to curb and prevent further abuses by all these groups without delay, as in some cases, they already appear to escape the control of government and security agencies.   Inter-Communal Violence   Since President Obasanjo came to power in May 1999, there appears to have been an increase in inter-communal violence across Nigeria. Several thousand people have been killed in fighting between different ethnic groups, particularly in the central Middle Belt states (Nasarawa, Plateau, Taraba). There have also been repeated clashes in the southwest, in the Delta, and in the north (Kano, Kaduna).   There are a number of longstanding conflicts that could explode again at any time. Among the most serious in the last year was the crisis in Jos (Plateau state) in September 2001, which claimed more than 1,000 lives. In recent weeks, there have been repeated outbreaks of inter-communal fighting in several other locations in Plateau state. The other particularly worrying situation is the ongoing conflict between the Jukuns and the Tivs, and related tensions between other groups, in the central states of Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa. This conflict culminated in the killing of more than 200 civilians by the military in Benue in October 2001.   There is also likely to be a recurrence of what could loosely be called """"religious tensions"""" in some of the northern states, some of which may be linked, at least superficially, to moves to extend Sharia law. However, it should be noted that the religious factor is not the only explanation for these conflicts, and is often manipulated by different groups in their fight for political and economic control.   The government has embarked on a number of initiatives to study these problems, but it remains to be seen whether these will be effective remedies, or just token exercises. To date the government has preferred to shy away from implementing concrete measures to prevent further violence. The Nigerian government, at federal and state levels, should actively seek measures to resolve these conflicts and to reconcile the different communities affected.   Massacres by the Military   Between 22 and 24 October 2001, in a well-organized reprisal operation following the abduction and killing of nineteen soldiers by a Tiv armed group, Nigerian soldiers killed more than 200 unarmed civilians and destroyed homes, public buildings and other property in more than seven towns and villages in Benue State. In the weeks following the massacres and destruction, soldiers still stationed in the area committed other human rights violations, including rape of women, ill treatment, harassment and extortion.   The Nigerian government has failed to take any action against the soldiers or their commanders responsible for the killings in Benue, or even to issue a strong condemnation. On the contrary, President Obasanjo appeared to defend these actions, or to seek to legitimize them. He even indicated that this was the kind of response which could be expected from soldiers, and that they may have been acting in self-defense, despite the absence of any evidence to support this view. Eventually, the government set up a commission of inquiry, which began holding hearings in May 2002. It is too early to say what its outcome will be, but its remit is vague and contains no specific reference to the killings by the military.   Human Rights Watch also regrets that foreign governments remained conspicuously silent about these events. Although some, including the U.S., have indicated that they raised the issue privately with Nigerian government officials, the lack of any significant public response to one of the most serious cases of human rights violations by the Nigerian security forces in recent years has been striking.   Human Rights Watch urges you to use this opportunity to issue a strong, public condemnation of these killings and call on the government to ensure that such incidents are not repeated, and that the Nigerian authorities carry out a prompt and independent investigation into the killings and destruction by the military, leading to the swift prosecution of those responsible for ordering the operation and perpetrating these abuses.   Extension of Sharia Law   In the last few months, several of the northern states of Nigeria have increasingly applied Sharia law. This includes the handing down, and in some cases the implementation, of cruel punishments, after trials which are almost certainly unfair, with limited rights of appeal and sometimes no legal representation. On 3 January 2002, there was the first execution under Sharia in Nigeria: a man was hanged after being found guilty of murdering a woman and her two children in Katsina State. Two women have faced death sentences for adultery. One, in Sokoto state, won her appeal. The appeal of the other, in Katsina, is still pending. There have also been several cases of floggings and amputations.   Human Rights Watch is appealing to the U.S. government to raise not only the cruel, inhuman and degrading nature of these punishments, but also the broader, fundamental issues of due process and training of judges and other members of the judiciary.   Niger Delta   In the Niger Delta, there have been numerous protests directed at oil companies, as well as violence between different communities, often directly or indirectly linked to the division of oil money. It is likely that active conflict will heat up as the 2003 elections become closer, since the basic issues have remained the same. The federal government has put in place yet another special task force for security in the delta, and troops are still extensively deployed in protection of oil facilities, raising concerns. There was a major oil spill in Ogoniland in April 2001, of which the causes are still a matter of dispute, and which is still to be properly cleaned up. Many people from the delta believe that the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) will be little more than a vehicle for corrupt siphoning off of funds, in the manner of previous similar bodies. The NDDC held a major conference late last year with UNDP to develop strategies for spending its money, but has yet to engage in any substantial projects on the ground.  Angola  Internally Displaced Persons   Based on two fact-finding missions to Angola in 2001, Human Rights Watch wishes to draw your attention to continuing protection concerns for internally displaced persons in Angola.   As efforts to implement peace in Angola get underway, including the demobilization of tens of thousands of UNITA combatants, there has been a sharp new rise in the number of Angolans requiring immediate assistance as a consequence of the war. This has exacerbated the humanitarian crisis, and raised the specter of new human rights abuses.   A renewed commitment from the international community - as well as the Angolan government - is urgently needed to ensure the protection of Angola's internally displaced. Following thirty years of conflict, as many as one-third of Angola's thirteen million people are internally displaced; another 435,000 Angolans fled the country altogether and became refugees abroad.   Although the ceasefire has ended the forced displacement that accompanied the war, the need for attention to the displaced has become, if anything, more urgent. Some 500,000 civilians who were isolated from all assistance behind UNITA lines or kept in areas controlled by government armed forces during the last four years have become accessible to humanitarian agencies for the first time, placing new pressure on existing provisions for displaced people. A further 256,900 people from families affiliated to UNITA fighters also need assistance. During the first two months of 2002, about 98,000 displaced persons were newly registered by United Nations (U.N.) and nongovernmental humanitarian agencies in Angola. Since February, new arrivals have averaged some 30,000 people a month. These people are no longer fleeing the war, but are trying to escape starvation and find assistance where it is provided. At least half of these people require immediate medical care and food provision. Of the 1.4 million displaced people that were already receiving humanitarian assistance, more than 400,000 are living in more than one hundred camps and transit centers. Many of these facilities have very poor conditions.   The displaced also continue to face serious security threats, including harassment by government forces, restrictions on free movement, and possible forced return to areas where they would be at risk of political persecution and human rights abuses.   The government and U.N. agencies are currently developing plans to resettle the internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their areas of origin. The operation, due to start in July, is expected to move 500,000 people by the end of this year.   Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned, however, that human rights considerations are being marginalized within these plans, and that neither the government nor any U.N. agency is taking responsibility for implementing an effective protection system for the displaced as the resettlement plans go forward-including ensuring that nobody is forced to move against their will. Given the past protection problems faced by IDPs in Angola, among them those housed in government-approved camps, this is a serious omission.   Plans and Committees, but Not Enough Action   Plans do exist on paper to ensure that the protection needs of the displaced are met. Over the last two years, following a series of high-level international visits to Angola that brought greater attention to the needs of the displaced, the U.N. has worked closely with the Angolan government to put in place policies and structures that should respond to protection issues, in particular. Most significantly, the government has adopted a new law, the Norms for the Resettlement of Displaced Populations, that sets out clear guidelines for resettlement and assistance, based on the U.N.'s own Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.   A whole range of groups and sub-groups bringing together relevant U.N. and government agencies has also been formed, with responsibilities for different aspects of assistance to displaced persons. A U.N. inter-agency protection strategy for IDPs was developed in 2000 and 2001, and is currently under revision once again. But effective implementation of these plans has been lacking. There is confusion and dispute within the U.N. itself as to the roles of the different U.N. agencies, government structures, and other partners, including nongovernmental organizations. The government has failed to fulfill its own responsibilities.   Making matters worse is the fact that, as of June 2002, only 24 percent of a U.N. appeal for U.S. $233 million to address the humanitarian crisis in Angola in 2002 had been met. An additional U.N. bridging request of U.S. $141 million has been launched to the international donor community, which includes specific provisions for protection, mainly for UNITA underage soldiers and family members. Together with the mine action program, however, the funds requested for protection represent only 4.6 percent of the total being sought.   U.N. Protection Efforts: No Clear Ownership   The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been responsible since mid-2001 for coordinating U.N. initiatives in relation to the protection of the internally displaced. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), though it has only a limited mandate in relation to IDPs and a very small presence in Angola, has also played an important role in focusing attention on protection issues.   However, following the failure of major donors, including the U.S., to renew funding for UNHCR's program with IDPs in Angola, UNHCR's activities for IDPs in Angola are currently scheduled to close in 2002. OCHA is also reviewing its work with the internally displaced; Human Rights Watch has learned that there is even a possibility that it too may withdraw from protection work. Even as it is, the latest draft of the U.N. inter-agency """"protection strategy for IDPs and returnees"""" only provides for human rights issues to be taken up with the government authorities in the case of harassment of humanitarian personnel and looting of humanitarian assets. In case of forced resettlement or harassment of returnees and others, the strategy focuses on monitoring and sensitization, the promotion of community-based protection initiatives, and the development of referral systems for victims rather than direct intervention with government authorities regarding the protection of IDPs. This is seriously inadequate and should be changed. Human Rights Watch has been critical of OCHA's protection role with IDPs in Angola. The agency is overstretched with other responsibilities and lacks experience in protection work.   We also believe that as the international agency mandated to protect refugees, UNHCR has greater expertise and experience in providing protection to forcibly displaced people. As such, UNHCR would appear in principle to be the most appropriate agency to lead protection work among the internally displaced in Angola.   However, at this stage the most urgent need is for the plans for the protection of the displaced that have been adopted in recent years to be implemented, and for clear lines of responsibility to be established for that work. In light of this, any suggestion that OCHA's protection work in Angola be discontinued gives cause for dismay. As OCHA already has a presence on the ground that would enable it to take up relatively quickly the new challenges of protection created by the changed circumstances in Angola since the death of Savimbi, it should retain that role. But UNHCR's involvement is also critical. In particular, UNHCR should be given sufficient funding to place a mobile team of roving protection officers in Angola-with responsibility for protection monitoring, training and capacity building, technical advice, and supervision. The planned return of refugees and IDPs following the ceasefire could provide an opportunity for the expansion of UNHCR's protection role in Angola.   The current mandate of the U.N. Office in Angola (UNOA), established by the Security Council in 1999, expires in July 2002. The terms of its renewal are currently being renegotiated by the U.N.'s Department of Political Affairs with the Angolan government, taking into account the changed circumstances brought about by the ceasefire. UNOA's Human Rights Division, in particular, should be more active in bringing attention to human rights abuses against the internally displaced. At present, however, the draft new mandate for UNOA does not include any provisions that cover protection for internally displaced persons. This omission should be rectified.   We urge your delegation to focus attention on the plight of Angola's internally displaced persons, and to pledge greater financial support for programs to protect the internally displaced, particularly for UNHCR's protection activities in Angola. We also urge you to provide financial and other support for the creation of a national network among local nongovernmental organizations and church groups active on human rights issues and with dealing with the displaced.   Thank you for your attention to these issues.   Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Executive Director Africa Division","Africa, United States, Angola, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/23/human-rights-conditions-vietnam","Human Rights Conditions in Vietnam","Human Rights Conditions in Vietnam","Testimony of Nguyen Vu Binh","07/23/2002","I very much appreciate the invitation to testify before the US Congress. I sincerely thank the Honorable Loretta Sanchez and the Congressional Human Rights Caucus for this precious opportunity to present my views on the condition of human rights in Vietnam.  On the situation of human rights violations, we, the democracy activists and relatives of those arrested senselessly and illegally, have signed the July 6, 2002 joint statement to raise [public awareness] for the many cases of human rights violations, typified by the following incidents:  1. On April 25, 2001, two days after the ascension of Mr. Nong Duc Manh to the position of General Secretary, Public Security of Hai Phong city arrested Mr. Vu Cao Quan and held him in prison for nine days for interrogations on his and other intellectuals' writings.  2. On July 12, 2001, Public Security of Ho Chi Minh City stopped and robbed retired General Tran Do of the manuscripts containing his views on the Ninth Congress [of the Vietnamese Communist Party].  3. On September 5, 2001, thanks to the application to form the """"People's Association to Support the State Fighting Corruption,"""" Messrs. Pham Que Duong, Tran Khue, Hoang Minh Chinh and almost 20 other people were arrested or harassed.  4. Throughout September and October 2001, the State re-established neighborhood prosecution sessions to denounce Messrs. Hoang Minh Chinh, Pham Que Duong, Nguyen Thanh Giang, and Le Chi Quang.  5. In late 2001, Public Security apprehended poet Bui Minh Quoc after he undertook a fact-finding trip along the Vietnam-China border. He is currently serving two years of house arrest. Also placed under house arrest are sociologist Tran Khue and biologist Ha Si Phu.  6. In January, 2002 Deputy Minister for Culture and Information Phan Khac Hai issued a directive, ordering a search-and-destroy campaign of books written by democracy activists. This Directive is a blatant violation of freedom of thought and freedom of expression.  7. In the last few months, the authorities have arrested rows of young [democracy activists] like Nguyen Khac Toan, Le Chi Quang, and Pham Hong Son without justifiable reasons.  8. [The authorities] have cut off the phone lines to the families of Hoang Minh Chinh, Pham Que Duong, Hoang Tien, Tran Khue, Tran Dung Tien, Ha Si Phu, Nguyen Dan Que, Bui Minh Quoc, Nguyen Thanh Giang, Nguyen Vu Binh, and so on.  9. [The authorities] harassed and imprisoned many lay-people and officials of various religions.  From these and many other cases, I have some conclusions on the condition of human rights in Vietnam as follows:  - The Vietnamese authorities have violated human rights on a frequent, continuous, and systematic basis. Thanks to the opening [to the outside world] and better information, the collective knowledge of Vietnamese people has been raised considerably. That automatically leads to more and stronger voices demanding freedom, democracy, religious rights, and so forth. Rising alongside that development is the government's oppression, resorting to all kinds of sophisticated and treacherous tactics. Such oppression violates the people's fundamental rights which are defined in the constitution itself and in various covenants on human rights signed by the Vietnamese government. In recent years, given the upsurge of more democratic voices and their ability to link up, the violation of fundamental human rights have increased both in severity and brazenness. This trend is expected to continue in the future.  - The Vietnamese authorities' record of human rights violations fluctuates over time, with some improvement at times and rising severity at others. The condemnations and interventions of democratic governments and human rights organizations have brought about some limited results but most of the time, have been reactive in nature. The current situation comes from two causes: the domestic democratic force is not strong enough to protect itself and international pressure on the Vietnamese government remains scattered and inconsistent.  After studying, monitoring, and researching the human rights violations problem and the democratic movement, I would like to propose a few measures that might be able to reduce, prevent, or gradually stop human rights violations.  First and foremost, individuals and groups whose fundamental rights are frequently violated must have a way to protect themselves. The ultimate goal of the Vietnamese government is to isolate, separate, and divide the democracy advocates to stop their association at all cost. They achieve this goal through tactics carefully devised and applied to each target. To deal with this situation, therefore, people whose ideals are to fight for democracy have no other choice but to join and lean on one another. This coalition must take into account the real condition inside the country and around the world as well as the current state of the democratic movement itself. In my opinion, such alliance should be public and based on the common goals supported by most people [in Vietnam].  The coalition of courageous people advocating for human rights in a country where rights only exist on paper not only generates self-defending power but also provides an entity that democratic governments and human rights organizations can help protect much more effectively. Furthermore, such coalition, with its perceived promised future, could very well induce even more pressure and interventions [from the world community].  As for the democratic governments and human rights organizations, it is imperative to find the Vietnamese Communists' Achilles' heel and the most effective way of applying pressure to defend human rights. This is, indeed, not easy because too many contradictions exist in Vietnam, enough to confuse countless analysts. However, logically speaking, given that the country is going through the process of industrialization and modernization and beyond, with a giant number of cadres in the Party, government, administration, and associations from the central to local level to pay, what they need the most must be dollars. It is very important for the regime to spend money on these systems (and not on the projects they borrowed the money for) to remain alive.  However, given its stubbornness and its ability to do whatever to survive, this communist government will only compromise or make concessions when international pressure is assured to be consistent and determined. I understand the US House of Representatives passed the Vietnam Human Rights Act by a 410-1 vote. Democracy activists in Vietnam are highly encouraged by this action and would like to express their appreciation toward the representatives who supported this legislation. The Vietnamese Communist Party has vehemently protested and is applying pressure to throw out the bill. I think this is the right time for the US to express its determination to stand with the Vietnamese people by officially passing this bill [in the Senate]. I believe this legislation will help improve the human rights condition in Vietnam.  Honorable Members of the Caucus,  The current condition in Vietnam is relatively favorable to achieve a breakthrough in the effort to defend human rights and campaign for democracy. The credibility of the Vietnamese Communist Party has sunk to a pathetic level following the fallout of the court case involving Truong Van Cam and accomplices (a.k.a. the Nam Cam case); The reduction of tariffs on imported goods under AFTA will soon begin;  And finally, I always believe that when we can successfully stop and prevent human rights violations across the country we have also succeeded in democratizing this nation. Any measures to fight for human rights, therefore, should also aim for the ultimate goals aspired for so long by the Vietnamese people: Individual liberty and a democratic society.  Thank you very much! Nguyen Vu Binh Hanoi, Vietnam","Asia, United States, Vietnam",""

On the other were the number of executions and a date -- 58 killed on March 5, 1998; 146 to 166 killed on March 28, 1999; 41 killed on May 14, 1999. Soon, a black-robed clerk knocked and told me it was time. The armrests of the witness chair were smeared black from the sweat of those who had come before. To my right sat the prosecution; to my left was the accused. Milosevic leaned back defiantly, one arm draped over his chair, looking out at the gallery watching the trial. Three judges, a Jamaican, a Briton and a South Korean, sat in front wearing black robes with red trim. First, the prosecution led me through our grim findings: forced expulsions of ethnic Albanians, mass executions, rape and sexual abuse. Photographs of the Delijaj family were shown, including the bodies of Donietta and Gentiona, 5 and 7, being carried out of the forest. I remembered their makeshift tent, a plastic tarp draped over wooden posts, where the family had been hiding, and a mattress soaked blood red. Direct testimony lasted an hour. Now I was his. Acting as his own lawyer, Milosevic has taken every opportunity to cross-examine witnesses, often dredging up details about their private lives. I turned slightly to the left and looked at the accused. To my surprise, he smiled from across the room. Did he know something I didn't? Or was he trying to intimidate me? I don't know why, but I smiled back. It just came over me, maybe from rattled nerves. There was something amusing about this situation, that a once-all-powerful president was forced to confront a pesky human rights activist from New York. After years in the field tracking the havoc he caused, it was he and I in this room. Of course, we were hardly alone. Cameras from all sides pointed at me, whirring mechanically as they changed their angles of attack. I wanted to testify even though I knew that many Serbs who watched these court proceedings saw Milosevic as a heroic fighter against the world -- his team's star scorer playing in the World Cup. He spoke of global conspiracies against the Serbs; I listed concrete crimes of the army and police. He accused me of singling out the Serbs for committing atrocities in order to justify the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Serbian and Yugoslav government leaders stood accused, not the Serbian people, I told him. It was as if we were moving in parallel worlds. His diatribes were aimed at the invisible audience back home, not the court. He turned away from the judges, toward the gallery beyond the bulletproof glass, when he accused me of ''working hand in glove with NATO'' or writing anti-Serb statements from the comfort of New York. In the end, he put forth arguments commonly heard from a bar stool. ''You are a New Yorker,'' he said after nearly two hours of cross-examination. ''How many killings and rapes, for example, are committed every day in New York?'' ''Don't answer that,'' Richard May, the presiding judge, said. Milosevic quickly returned to his theme. ''How come that you as an American, as a New Yorker, you take greater care of the human rights of Albanians in Yugoslavia than you do about human rights of Americans in America?'' ''Irrelevant,'' May snapped. ''Next question.''  The question was irrelevant to the legal charges against him. But this line of reasoning couldn't fail to impress Serbs who believe they have been unfairly singled out for attack. Minutes later, our dance was done. I got up to leave, the armrests slightly blacker from my sweat. ========= Fred Abrahams is a former senior researcher for Human Rights Watch.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), the organization's governing body for human rights, will next week debate a draft Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture. The new treaty would establish an international system of inspection visits to places of detention, but would only apply to those countries that ratify it. The current text has been put forward by Costa Rica and enjoys wide support from ECOSOC members, including members of the European Union and many Latin American, Caribbean and African states. But the United States has signaled its opposition and wants negotiations on the text re-opened. “Yet again the Bush Administration is on a collision course with its allies over an important new mechanism to protect human rights,” said Rory Mungoven, Global Advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Last week, it was the International Criminal Court, this week, it's the prevention of torture.” Human Rights Watch said the draft Optional Protocol represented the best compromise possible after ten years of difficult negotiations. It addressed many of the concerns previously raised by governments, including the United States. The U.S. government has objected to the proposal, claiming that prison visits by an international body would be too intrusive. But the system of visits has many checks and balances, ensuring consultation with governments, prior-notification of visits and the confidentiality of reports. It can be adapted to different legal cultures, including federal systems. And if the U.S. government didn´t ratify the new treaty, it would not face any inspections at all. Human Rights Watch warned that the U.S. proposal to re-open negotiations on the draft would be the kiss-of-death for the treaty. Abusive governments, many of which have not even signed the Convention Against Torture, would use further negotiations to water down or block the adoption of the protocol. “By sending this treaty for more negotiations, the United States would be playing into the hands of countries such as Cuba and Iran, which want to block international scrutiny of human rights,” Mungoven said. Human Rights Watch said the U.S. government should not oppose or delay adoption of the protocol, even if it chose not to ratify the treaty itself","United States","United Nations"

Security Council members met yesterday to deliberate the situation in the Mano River Union of West Africa, Human Rights Watch called on them to take a comprehensive approach to ending the bloodshed and repression in Liberia.   """"Security Council sanctions to end the arms-for-diamonds trade in West Africa contributed to the emerging peace in Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division. """"Now the Security Council needs to condemn human rights abuses by the Liberian government and the rebels, take steps to end Guinea's support for the Liberian rebels, and ensure that the Liberian conflict does not destabilize the fragile peace in Sierra Leone.""""   Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to condemn abuses committed by all sides in the conflict in Liberia; to take steps to end Guinea's role in providing logistic assistance to the Liberian rebels; to strengthen the mandate of the U.N. Peace-Building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL) and increase its staffing and funding to enable the placement of human rights monitors to investigate abuses; and to request the Secretary-General to fill the vacant position of representative in Liberia, with a mandate to report to the Security Council and make recommendations to resolve the conflict.   In the nine-page letter to the Security Council, Human Rights Watch documented how, between April and June 2002, Liberian government forces committed scores of war crimes and other serious abuses against civilians in the northwest of the country. Fighting has raged in the country since the start of a rebel incursion in mid-2000.   Recent victims described to Human Rights Watch how members of the government army and pro-government militias executed numerous civilians, shot and beaten to death males of all ages for resisting conscription, carried out widespread rape of women and girls as young as twelve, subjected hundreds of civilians to forced labor, and restricted the movement of hundreds of civilians intending to flee as refugees into neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea.   Another disturbing development is the renewed use of child combatants by members of the Liberian security forces. Children are once again being recruited to form part of the army and pro-government militias.   In the face of renewed rebel action, the government of Charles Taylor has become increasingly intolerant of dissent. Since the imposition of a state of emergency in February 2002, the government has steadily imprisoned, harassed, and beaten individuals that have been critical of its policies.   Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the fate of five nurses from the Liberian humanitarian organization, Merci, who were abducted on June 20, 2002 from the Sinje camp area by the Liberian rebels. The Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebels have admitted holding the nurses in their northern stronghold of Voinjama. In addition, Human Rights Watch continues to receive credible reports of continued forced conscription of civilians, including children, by the LURD.  Victim and Witness Testimony of Human Rights Abuses by Liberian Government Soldiers  An elderly woman from a village near Masambalahun described how in late April 2002 she and some 150 other civilians hiding in the forest were indiscriminately fired on by Liberian government troops. After being forced to walk to nearby Bondowalahun, she describes how she witnessed the brutal killing of several civilians, including a young mother and her infant daughter:  When the soldiers - those under the command of CO Stanley - found us hiding in the bush we took off running in all directions. They saw we weren't rebels but fired on us anyway. As they rounded us up I saw many bodies scattered around - maybe fifteen or so. My brother was one of them. I wasn't able to have children, so my brother was the only person I had in my life. Then the soldiers made us walk to Bondowalahun. During the month we were there I saw them kill many people. After rounding up civilians from the bush they'd line them up and pick out four or five and kill them near the river. Sometimes we'd see their bodies when we went to fetch water. One day when I was down near the river I saw an officer named Chief Jalloh take a young woman who held her little daughter in her arms. He asked her, ‘which of you wants to die - you or your baby.' She pleaded with him, begging that she not have to make such a choice. Then he said, ‘you didn't answer my question, so I guess you're both going to die.' Then he took out a pistol and shot the baby in the head, and then his mother. Then he dumped their bodies into the river.  A forty-five-year-old woman, also held in Bondowalahun, described a similar killing of five civilians in early May 2002:  Oh Bondowalahun... the river was flowing with the bodies of those killed by the government troops. I was only held there for three days, but it was long enough to see many people killed. Every time they'd bring the villagers in from the bush it was... ‘you, you, you and you.' Then we'd hear the shots. It was very random. For example, after lining up about twenty civilians they marched into town, they picked a few to take ammunition and looted property to Lukasu and chose five to kill; two young seventeen or eighteen year old men, and older man and a young woman and her child. They marched all five of them off towards the river and a few minutes later we heard the ‘pop, pop' of the gun - five times. The next day when I went down to the river, I saw all five of them lying dead on the riverbank. While being marched to Vahun a few days later, I saw more bodies scattered along the path.  In May 2002, a fifty-five-year-old woman witnessed soldiers under the command of AFL commanders Zizimaza and Stanley, beat her thirty-year-old son to death. She described the incident, which happened in the town of Vahun:  My son H. was killed in front of my eyes. After capturing about thirty of us from the forest they marched us to their base in Vahun. After arriving they separated the men from the women, and told the five men to march directly into the training camp. In fact, one of them was a boy of about twelve. Meanwhile they told the women and children to go into some nearby houses about twenty meters away. I heard my son saying he didn't want the soldier life and when he reached the base, I saw the soldiers attack him. There were many other men in the same position so I don't know why they beat him so. I could hear them screaming, ‘what's wrong with you? You don't want to defend your land?' After an hour of being beaten and kicked, he started vomiting blood and then they stabbed him with knives. A few of them walked on his stomach. A few times I peeked out from where the women were being held, but one of the soldiers said, ‘do you want to die?' He died later that same day.  A twenty year old woman described how in late May 2002, her husband was executed in front of her as he tried to defend her from being sexually assaulted by AFL soldiers. Two of the same soldiers later raped her.  From February until May 2002 my husband and I had been trying to survive in the bushes around the town of Yandohun. It was difficult to find food but somehow we were managing. Then one day, the government troops surprised us and forced us to walk to their base in Vahun. About two days after we arrived, two soldiers came up to me and said that they wanted me. My husband tried to defend me, saying, ‘no, she's my woman, please leave us.' As they argued, one of the soldiers shot my husband in the chest. He fell down and then the same soldier shot him a second time in the back. Then those same two men who killed my husband dragged me into a house and raped me. At first I struggled with them but they said if I didn't agree they'd do the same thing to me that they did to my husband. After they were finished, but when I was still on the ground, one of them kicked me hard in my stomach and told me to get up and go.  A forty-five-year-old woman described how in early June soldiers in Vahun led away her daughters - aged fifteen and six - and one-year-old grandchild. The next day she found the mutilated body of the fifteen year old.  When I was led into Vahun by those soldiers I had all five of my children - when I fled a month later I only had two left. In May about twenty soldiers captured us from the forest around Yomatahun. We were forced to walk two days to get to their base in Vahun. After arriving they told us to find an abandoned house to stay in. The next morning two soldiers came to the door and pointed out my two daughters and little grandchild and told them to follow. They were mean and aggressive. I saw other soldiers going around and collecting more people from other nearby houses. I followed them for a while but they pointed their guns at me and said they'd shoot me if I followed them. Later the same day other civilians came to me and said they'd overheard the AFL soldiers talking about how they'd killed all those people they'd taken from the village. I was beside myself with grief. I just didn't want to believe it so the next day I crept out with someone who said they knew the way to where the bodies were. We walked about thirty minutes and in the grass behind a house on a hill I saw the body of my fifteen-year-old S. She was without a blouse and one of her breasts had been cut off. I also saw that her throat had been slashed. I lost control and couldn't bear to look for the other two. But a friend told me she'd seen their bodies in the same area. Shortly after this Vahun came under attack by dissidents, and I collected my other two children and fled.  A woman described how frequently soldiers sexually abused woman civilians being held in Vahun, and how she cared for her twelve-year-old cousin who was in June 2002 gang-raped by three soldiers:  Every time the soldiers brought in a new group of civilians from the bush they'd yell, ‘hey convoy is here, convoy is here, be prepared to do woman business.' Raping? That was the way they did business. It was an everyday affair; pregnant, suckling mother, or girl child - it didn't matter. They did it to me, to my friends and even to my little twelve-year-old cousin. I saw it happening. Three of them did it. One of them even put his hands over my elderly mothers eyes so she couldn't watch. After it was over we took the girl into the house and had her sit in warm water and salt. She bled for several days.","Africa, Liberia","United Nations"

""""It is difficult to achieve reconciliation without justice,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"We hope that parliamentary debate will lead to a stronger law that will allow realization of these complementary objectives.""""     The letter was sent to President of the Parliament Francisco Gutteres, Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri and President José Alexandre Gusmão on July 16, 2002. (See full text of letter in related materials, in English and Bahasa Indonesia.)     President Gusmão has long advocated an amnesty to speed reconciliation in East Timor after almost three decades of conflict and Indonesian occupation. Amnesty is also seen as a way to encourage the return of thousands of East Timorese now in refugee camps in Indonesian West Timor. The proposed law is primarily meant to address crimes committed during the Indonesian occupation and an explosion of violence by Indonesian-armed militias, following a referendum on independence in September 1999.     The draft law was to be passed by May 20 independence celebrations, but was withdrawn for revisions before being resubmitted to the parliament by the cabinet. The draft extends amnesties to all of those guilty of crimes against property prior to May 20, 2002, and to any members of the resistance not guilty of war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide. It also extends sentence reductions to all other prisoners, including those convicted of crimes against humanity.     The law fails to clearly define crucial terms such as violent crimes. Nor does it specify a process for making difficult distinctions regarding membership in the resistance or what it means to be compelled to join a militia. These gaps raise fears of violations of due process and the possibility that perpetrators of serious crimes could go unpunished.     If not carefully designed and implemented, amnesties may undermine reconciliation efforts and weaken the rule of law, Human Rights Watch said. In Dili, Nobel laureate Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo and nongovernmental organizations have also raised concerns about the draft amnesty law.     Human Rights Watch urged the Timorese parliament to continue to solicit the input and views of East Timorese citizens, nongovernmental organizations and civil society institutions when considering the law.","Asia, Timor-Leste","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/18/burma-crackdown-muslims","Burma- Crackdown on Muslims","Burma: Crackdown on Muslims","","07/18/2002","(New York) - The impact of violent attacks against Muslims last year in Burma should be high on the agenda of the U.N. special envoy when he visits Burma next month, Human Rights Watch said today. The U.N. should also focus on the continuing violations of religious freedom and other fundamental human rights faced by Muslims in Burma. These abuses were highlighted in a twelve-page briefing paper, """"Crackdown on Burmese Muslims,"""" released by Human Rights Watch today. The paper, based on interviews with Burmese Muslims and religious leaders inside the country, eyewitnesses to the attacks, and other material, provides details not previously known outside the country.  """"The Burmese government must protect the rights of Muslims. Instead, it has imposed restrictions on Muslim religious activities and taken no action to punish those responsible for destroying Muslim homes and mosques,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.  Former Malaysian Ambassador Razali Ismail, the U.N.'s special envoy, is due to make his eighth trip to Burma on August 2. He is expected to meet with ethnic minority leaders as well as government officials and the National League for Democracy (NLD.)  Human Rights Watch said that various factors sparked last year's confrontations between Buddhists and Muslims, including anger over the destruction of Buddhist images in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, in March 2001. Military authorities confiscated pirated photos and videos of the Bamiyan statues being blown up by the Taliban, fearful they would enflame Buddhist sentiment. But in some cities outside Rangoon, there were credible reports of military intelligence officers stirring up anti-Muslim violence.  The worst violence in eastern Burma took place in May and September 2001, when the country's economic crisis was particularly severe. In Taungoo, north of Rangoon, more than a thousand people led by robed Buddhist monks attacked Muslim shops, homes and mosques. There were beatings and at least nine deaths, but the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) reportedly did little or nothing to intervene to stop or prevent the attacks. There were also outbreaks of violence in Prome in early October and Pegu. Restrictions on travel by Muslims were far more rigidly enforced in 2001, and earlier this year the government tightly restricted the number of Muslims allowed to travel to Mecca for the Haj pilgrimage. Muslims claimed they continue to have special difficulties getting passports to travel abroad.  In Arakan State, a predominantly Muslim area, human rights abuses have long been commonplace, including forced labor, restrictions on freedom of movement, and destruction of mosques. But in February 2001, full scale riots broke out in Sittwe, the state capital. The authorities did nothing to stop the violence initially, though they ultimately intervened and imposed a curfew for more than two months. Muslims from nearby areas were forbidden to travel to Sittwe. As of May 2002, few Muslims were being allowed to travel freely out of northern Arakan.  Later in the year, there were credible reports in Arakan of local mosques being destroyed at the order of local military commanders. One former Muslim teacher quoted government officials as saying, """"In Afghanistan, Talibans have destroyed statues of our Lord Buddha, so that is why we were destroying your mosques here.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the Burmese government to take immediate steps to end the persecution of Muslim communities, to prosecute those responsible for attacks on Muslim civilians and property, and to ensure that losses are properly compensated. The government should also allow Ambassador Razali and the U.N. Special Rapporteur for Myanmar, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, unrestricted access to Muslim areas, including the sites of last year's violence, so that they can meet with local Muslim residents and community leaders","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

But opposition remains strong, nevertheless, evinced in the public's persistent refusal to acknowledge the legal and factual reality of the trial unfolding in The Hague. Next week's testimony by former Milosevic regime insiders may well become a new target for distorted interpretations, as trial observers focus on what they will argue is a make or break moment for the prosecution. Next week's testimony by former Milosevic regime insiders may well become a new target for distorted interpretations, as trial observers focus on what they will argue is a make or break moment for the prosecution. A discrepancy between developments in the courtroom and perceptions in Belgrade has marked the Milosevic trial from the start. After the prosecutor's opening remarks, Milosevic's statement and the first cross-examinations, both nationalists and moderates in Serbia tended to conclude that the Albanian witnesses lacked credibility. They felt the prosecutor was making a case against Serbia's recent history and politics, rather than against any specific acts committed by the accused. In fact, some Kosovo Albanians who testified appeared unconvincing when they denied all knowledge of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) activities in their areas. Yet most of what they said about killings, beatings, expulsions, pillage and other crimes with which Milosevic is charged was consistent and so vividly recalled that no one can seriously doubt these events took place. Since mid-April, witnesses have become a little franker in response to questions about the KLA. Yet the media and talking heads in Belgrade have failed to acknowledge any change. In the first months of the trial, observers in Belgrade also dismissed the Kosovo Albanian testimonies as second-hand accounts. In fact, almost all the witnesses had something to say about crimes they had personally observed, be it the confiscation of personal documents at a border crossing, the destruction of a house, or an actual killing. Several survivors of massacres also testified, alongside others who saw their relatives killed. The critics of """"second-hand testimonies"""" have still to acknowledge this fact openly. The Serbian media glossed over powerful testimonies of two survivors of the killings in the village of Racak in January 1999. These accounts, along with descriptions of those events by international observers who visited the site after the killings, all supported the case that most victims at Racak were civilians killed in cold blood. But in Serbia the myth that the killings were a hoax staged by Albanians has proved too strong to abandon in spite of the facts presented at the trial. Unable to dismiss the actual testimonies, Serbian reporters in The Hague and their media colleagues at home have joined Milosevic in searching for minor inconsistencies. When two survivors testified about the March 1999 killings of 105 Kosovo Albanians in Mala Krusa, one Serbian reporter - just like Milosevic - focused on the seeming discrepancy between one of the witnesses who said the police fired from a doorway and the other who said the fire came from a window. The first witness also called the building where the killings took place a cowshed, while the second said it was a house. The Serbian reporter who homed in on this ignored the fact that the second witness went on to describe this house as uninhabited, saying it had no furniture and was filled with hay and """"things for cows."""" The second witness also recalled that his description of events was based on the room he had been in at the time, adding that he could not tell anything about the direction the gunfire came from in the other room. Another popular charge in Serbia against the trial is that it is political. While a lot of history and politics was undoubtedly heard in the opening days, the case has since unfolded as a standard criminal trial, focusing on details related to specific crimes. It is these crimes that Milosevic is on trial for, not Serbia's history and political development. Next week's coverage of the insider testimonies is likely be characterized by much the same kind of distortion and misinformation that's already taken place. Each time either an insider, politician from Kosovo or high-profile foreigner has been scheduled to testify, the media in Belgrade portrays him as the prosecution's """"key witness."""" When the witness duly fails to produce Milosevic's """"smoking gun,"""" these same observers regularly trumpet the conclusion that the testimony was another flop for the prosecution. What is invariably overlooked is the fact that the domestic media, not the prosecutor, had promoted the witness as the trump card in the first place. The media in Belgrade have failed to grasp the crux of these testimonies. While the public was interested chiefly in the exchanges that the witnesses had with Milosevic on politics and history, the most legally relevant parts have supported the prosecution theory that the defendant bore command responsibility for atrocities committed by Serbian forces. This command responsibility requires three elements for a guilt verdict to be brought: knowledge of the offences, control of the forces responsible and failure to take necessary and reasonable measures to prevent the acts or punish the perpetrators. Like other high-profile witnesses, next week's insiders will probably provide evidence that they informed Milosevic of atrocities in Kosovo and that he controlled the troops responsible. They may also testify that the defendant did not try to intervene to stop the crimes nor bring troops implicated in them to justice.  The testimonies of the insiders next week will not change perspectives in Belgrade overnight. But they may just dislodge a brick in the once solid wall of prejudice and misunderstanding that the Serbs have built up over the tribunal and the Milosevic trial.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

In your meeting with President Musharraf, we ask you to: 1.) seek specific progress in establishing accountability for violence and discrimination against women; and 2.) advise him against amending the constitution unilaterally prior to holding elections. In short, we hope you will seek to advance in Pakistan the principles President Bush outlined last month in his commencement address at West Point: that """"a thriving nation will respect the rights of women, because no society can prosper while denying opportunity to half its citizens"""" while """"a truly strong nation will permit legal avenues of dissent for all groups that pursue their aspirations without violence.""""   We provide the following by way of background on these two important issues.   Violence and discrimination against women   The 2001 State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices document the widespread nature of domestic and sexual violence against women in Pakistan. Similarly, in its annual human rights report, the nongovernmental Human Rights Commission of Pakistan recorded 430 reported cases of """"honor killings"""" of women from just two major provinces of the country. President Musharraf pledged in April 2000 to put an end to violence against women, especially honor crimes, but Pakistani human rights and women's rights groups report that the government has taken inadequate measures to address this issue.   To protect and promote women's human rights in Pakistan, legal and institutional reforms will be needed. In Human Rights Watch's October 1999 report on Pakistan, Crime or Custom? Violence against Women in Pakistan, we documented how women's unequal and subordinate status under the law, perpetuated by biased officials at all levels of the criminal justice system, contributed to high levels of violence against women. Such violence remains largely unremedied because of practical and legal barriers that prevent women from accessing the legal system.   Recent cases attest to the continuing discrimination women face in both law and customary practices. In May of this year, a Pakistani rape victim, Zafran Bibi, was charged with adultery and sentenced to death by stoning under the discriminatory Hudood Ordinances, which criminalize extramarital sex and place the burden of proof on the victim to show that sex was coerced, thus discouraging rape victims from filing charges. After an active campaign by national women's rights groups, the Federal Shariat Court of Pakistan overturned the sentence. However, the law that led to her conviction remains in effect. It is a major source of abuse against women victims of violence, who are often wrongly charged when unable to meet the discriminatory evidentiary requirements needed to prove rape.   Customary and extra-judicial practices are also a source of abuse against women in Pakistan. On June 22, during a tribal council meeting in southern Punjab, four men, including one of the tribal council members, allegedly raped Mukhtaran Bibi, a thirty-year-old woman. The rape, which occurred in the presence of a large number of villagers, was intended as """"punishment"""" for the conduct of her brother, Abdul Shaqoor, who had been seen with an unchaperoned woman from another tribe. In the same case, her brother was also raped and the police are said to have asked for a bribe before releasing him from police custody. Although some of the perpetrators have been arrested and an investigation is underway, the role of the police in this and other such cases and, more broadly, the exercise of authority by tribal councils must be addressed to prevent future abuses.   You can make an important contribution to addressing these problems by highlighting the Pakistan government's inadequate response, and by encouraging the government to repeal discriminatory provisions of the Hudood Ordinances. In addition, we ask you to urge the Pakistan government to ensure that tribal councils act in accordance with the law, in a manner that respects women's rights, and without usurping the proper judicial authority of the state.   Concerns over proposed constitutional amendments   President Musharraf has proposed a series of far-reaching amendments to the Pakistan constitution that, if implemented, would dramatically strengthen the power of the presidency, formalize the role of the army in governance, and diminish the authority of elected representatives. The amendments would also significantly curb freedom of association and the freedom of individuals to stand for elected office. These provisions will limit the opportunity for moderate voices representing the majority of Pakistani citizens to exercise political leadership.   At the heart of the proposed amendments-which were announced on June 26, 2002, and are open for public comment until July 31-are provisions constraining the office of the prime minister and establishing a military-dominated National Security Council to oversee the functioning of the government. Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned by the following proposals that would: ·  Grant the president power to dismiss the prime minister on a variety of grounds, including """"failure to check corruption,"""" and to dissolve the National Assembly if governance """"cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the constitution."""" This provision is modeled on an earlier amendment to the constitution under the martial law regime of General Mohammad Zia-ul Haq, which was repealed by an act of parliament in 1997. Under President Musharraf's proposed language, the president would also be under no obligation to hold new elections within the ninety-day time frame presently required by the Constitution.  Grant the president discretion to appoint provincial governors, who in turn would appoint provincial chief ministers with the approval of the president. The chief ministers head the provincial administrations in Pakistan and, under the constitution, should have the confidence of the majority of the members of the democratically elected provincial assemblies. Requiring presidential consent for their appointment would significantly erode the powers of the provincial assemblies.  Create a National Security Council that would not only serve as a consultative body on strategic matters, but would also advise on structures of governance, the removal of federal or provincial cabinets, and the dissolution of national or provincial assemblies. Under the proposed amendment, the National Security Council would be dominated by serving military officers, including General Musharraf in his dual capacities as Army Chief of Staff and President - in effect creating a """"super-cabinet"""" that would shadow the work of the civilian cabinet.  Circumscribe the right to form or be a member of political parties by the government's interest in maintaining """"public order."""" In Pakistan, preventive detention under public-order laws has routinely been used to quell political protests, including planned demonstrations by political parties across the country last year in support of the restoration of democracy. The proposed amendment could apply the same ill-defined criteria to the right to form or operate political parties.  Limit candidates for election to the National Assembly or Senate to persons who have attained a bachelor's degree. Given the poor educational infrastructure in the country and sharp social and gender inequalities, this provision would inevitably bar all but a small percentage of the citizenry from holding parliamentary office.   Taken together, President Musharraf's proposed amendments would result in elected governments at the federal and provincial level that are effectively subordinate to-indeed, exist at the discretion of-the president and the military. When meeting with President Musharraf and in your public remarks, we urge you to raise the troubling implications of these amendments for democratic governance in Pakistan. As the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan has said, the question of amending the constitution should reside with the elected representatives of the people of Pakistan.   Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions regarding our findings or recommendations. Thank you for your attention to these concerns.   Sincerely,   LaShawn R.

Security Council Regarding Deliberations on the Mano River Union","","07/17/2002","Your Excellency,   Human Rights Watch welcomes your upcoming deliberations on the Mano River Union, and wishes to take this opportunity to focus your attention on the deplorable and deteriorating human rights situation in Liberia and on the need to take concrete steps to stop the bloodshed.   The Security Council's active role in attempting to end the arms-for-diamonds trade in Liberia and sub-region contributed to the emerging peace in Sierra Leone. We strongly urge you to remain engaged in the consolidation of peace in Sierra Leone and to address the worsening situation in Liberia, which threatens once again to disrupt peace in the sub-region.   Human Rights Watch remains gravely concerned about abuses and war crimes being committed by Liberian government forces in north-west Liberia; intensification of government harassment and intimidation of the independent press, civil society groups, legitimate political opposition; the forceful conscription of and renewed use of child combatants by members of the Liberian security forces; and the systematic theft and extortion of civilians trying to flee across the border into Sierra Leone. We are also concerned about the fate of five nurses from the Liberian humanitarian organization, Merci, who were on June 20, 2002 abducted from the Sinje camp area by the Liberian rebels. The Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebels have admitted holding the nurses in their northern stronghold of Voinjama. In addition, Human Rights Watch continues to receive credible reports of continued forced conscription of civilians, including children, by LURD rebels.   In particular, we call on the Security Council to condemn abuses committed by all sides in the conflict in Liberia; to take steps to end Guinea's role in providing logistic assistance to the Liberian rebels; to strengthen the mandate of the U.N. Peace-Building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL) and increase its staffing and funding to enable the placement of human rights monitors to investigate abuses; and to request the Secretary General to fill the vacant position of representative in Liberia, with a mandate to report to the Security Council and make recommendations to resolve the conflict.   Continuing War Crimes: Recent Abuses Documented by Human Rights Watch    Over the last two weeks Human Rights Watch has documented how, between April and June 2002, Liberian government forces committed scores of war crimes and other serious abuses against civilians in the northwest of the country. Fighting has raged in the country since the start of a rebel incursion by the LURD in mid-2000, the fifth serious outbreak of violence since the 1997 elections that ended the civil war.   Recent victims described to Human Rights Watch how members of the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) and pro-government militias executed numerous civilians, shot and beat to death males of all ages for resisting conscription, carried out widespread rape of women and girls as young as twelve, subjected hundreds of civilians to forced labor, and restricted the movement of hundreds of civilians intending to flee as refugees into neighboring Sierra Leone and Guinea.   Some recent abuses by Liberian security forces documented by Human Rights Watch occurred in and around Vahun District in northeastern Lofa County, and followed a similar pattern: after driving LURD forces from an area, government forces hunted down and detained local people whom they found hiding in the bush, often firing indiscriminately at them in the process. In some cases those civilians had previously been living in towns and areas under the command of LURD rebels. Once detained, the civilians were accused of supporting the LURD and then beaten, tortured, or summarily executed. Those who were not killed were then forced to walk to government strongholds, including Vahun and Foya, where they were subjected to forced labor and threatened with death if caught fleeing. Young women and girls were very often raped and forced to become """"wives"""" to the soldiers; young men were conscripted, made to carry looted goods and captured weapons. The conscripts were then sent to the front, often without any proper training. The civilians forced to remain under government control described severe shortages of food and medical care, leading to an alarmingly high mortality rate. Most of the victims were from the Gbandi ethnic group, which the Taylor government indiscriminately accuses, along with Mandingos and Krahns, of supporting the rebel incursion.   Some of the violations by government forces over the past two months documented by Human Rights Watch are as follows (a sample of victim testimonies is attached):  A witness being held in Bondowalahun witnessed soldiers shoot a baby girl and her young mother in late April, and then dump the bodies into the nearby river.  An elderly woman described how her thirty-year-old son was, in late April, beaten to death in Vahun after resisting conscription.  A twenty-year-old woman described how in late May, her husband was executed in front of her as he tried to defend her from being sexually assaulted by government soldiers, two of whom later raped her.  A forty-five-year-old woman described how in early June soldiers in Vahun led away her daughters-ages fifteen and six-and one-year-old grandchild. The next day she found the mutilated body of the fifteen-year-old.  In May, the husband and six-year-old grandchild of a forty-five-year-old woman were gunned down after being captured near Bondawalahun for not walking fast enough. After being taken to the army base in the same town, five other civilians from her group were arbitrarily selected for summary execution.  A seventeen-year-old woman with a three-month-old infant described being repeatedly raped by soldiers in Vahun during the last trimester of her pregnancy.  Another woman described caring for her twelve-year-old cousin who was in June gang-raped in Vahun by three soldiers.   Renewed Use of Child Combatants and Violations Against those Seeking Asylum    Since the LURD incursion began, new militia groups have been proliferating, whose numbers, structures, and leaders remain unclear. Both the AFL command and Ministry of Defense officials in Liberia told Human Rights Watch that the Taylor government's frontline troops are drawn not only from the AFL but increasingly include militia groups largely made up hundreds of former National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) combatants, many of them originally recruited as children. Many of the commanders leading the new militias have a well-documented history of serious human rights abuses.   Another disturbing development involves the renewed use of child combatants by members of the Liberian security forces. According to credible witnesses, children are once again being recruited to form part of the army and pro-government militias. Witnesses from Monrovia and Gbarnga say children, many of them armed, are frequently seen manning checkpoints and riding in military vehicles. Others describe how children attempting to flee with their parents towards the border with Sierra Leone are stopped at checkpoints manned by the Anti-Terrorist Unit. After being separated from their parents, they are taken to a base where their heads are shaved. Some parents are then able to """"buy"""" their children's freedom. Children whose parents do not have enough money are then sent to the battlefront after having received little or no training.   Liberian women crossing into Sierra Leone frequently report that their husbands, sons and other male relatives between the ages of fifteen and forty-five have been taken away, often at gunpoint, at military checkpoints along the highway between Monrovia and the border. Once at the border, military personnel search and subsequently steal anything of value. The civilians are then routinely required to pay the soldiers to secure passage into Sierra Leone. Those who are not able to pay are sometimes subjected to forced labor by the soldiers, for example clearing brush, before being allowed to cross.   Attacks on Civil Society Groups    In the face of renewed rebel action, the Taylor government has become increasingly intolerant of dissent. Since the imposition of a state of emergency in February 2002, the government has intensified its harassment and intimidation of the independent press, civil society groups, and legitimate political opposition groups. Since the Taylor government took office, government security forces have imprisoned, harassed, beaten and in a few cases, killed individuals that have been critical of its policies. Some of the most recent incidents are included below:  After the National Human Rights Center of Liberia, an umbrella organization comprising nine nongovernmental human rights groups, issued several press releases protesting government abuses, five of its members-Aloysius Toe, Tunny Zeogar, Peter Nickoson, John Okai, and Sam Nimely-were arrested on March 28 and held without charge for several days. Although they were released after a court order was filed, they were rearrested shortly after, and charged with """"criminal malevolence"""" and """"preventing arrest and discharge of other duties."""" On April 24, human rights lawyer Tiawan Gongloe was arrested without charge by the police, and beaten so severely that he was unable to stand and required hospitalization. He had been speaking out against security force abuses and other human rights violations. The Analyst newspaper, which had just reported on a statement recently made by Gongloe at a conference on peace in the Mano River Union, was ordered closed. Hassan Bility, the editor of one of Liberia's most independent newspapers, remains in incommunicado detention since his arrest on June 24, together with Ansumana Kamara, Abubakar Kamara, and Blama Kamara. At the time, the Minister of Information Reginald Goodridge issued a public statement announcing that Bility and the others were being held on suspicion of operating a rebel terrorist cell in Monrovia. The government has said that it intends to try him in a military court as an unlawful combatant. Over the past year, Hassan Bility has been interrogated and detained twice, and his newspaper, The Analyst, has been closed down twice, as the result of publishing articles deemed critical of the government. The Analyst was closed down the second time after reporting Tiawan Gongloe's speech on the role of civil society groups. On July 13, delegates from the Brussels-based International Crisis Group were held for two and a half hours at the airport, and were threatened by government officials for their report on Liberia. Mike Gaydh, a human rights activist from the National Human Rights Center, who had accompanied them to the airport, was questioned by the Anti-Terrorist Unit before being released without charge.   Threat of Destabilization of Sierra Leone    The renewal of war in Liberia could easily destabilize the fragile peace in Sierra Leone and indeed threatens to further undermine prospects for sustainable peace in the Mano River Union. The area is also awash with arms and former combatants and other young men willing to cross over to any side as mercenaries.   Over the past decade, the governments of these three countries have frequently harbored each other's rebel groups and supported cross-border incursions, causing widespread instability. There is already ample evidence of this happening again. Over the past year hundreds of Sierra Leonean ex-combatants have crossed into Liberia to fight as mercenaries. LURD forces operating from Sierra Leone are clandestinely operating a supply line along the border and both LURD forces and former RUF combatants are actively involved in recruitment. Liberian government troops and LURD rebel soldiers are crossing into Sierra Leone to loot or escape fighting, and, in a few cases, to abduct people for forced labor. Liberian army deserters are also to be found on the Sierra Leone side of the border, where they are presenting an additional security threat.   The government of Guinea is also playing a destabilizing role in providing considerable logistical and some military support to the LURD rebels that operate from Guinea. Evidence indicates that this support is being given with the knowledge and support of high-ranking Guinean officials, including the president. Guinea's support to the LURD intensified after the Liberian government, assisted by Sierra Leonean rebel fighters and Guinean dissidents, launched a series of cross-border attacks into Guinea in late 2000 and early 2001.   Recommendations    We believe that sustainable peace in the sub-region will only emerge if there is consistent pressure on all the Mano River Union countries to: (1) End cross-border attacks and illicit weapons flows; (2) Cease support for armed rebel activity; (3) Respect the rule of law and human rights; (4) Prevent and punish war crimes and other human rights abuses; and to (5) Create state institutions that are transparent and accountable, particularly the state security apparatus. We call on the Security Council to:   Continue to strengthen the mechanisms to ensure compliance with existing U.N.-mandated controls on weapons flows that could destabilize the sub-region and to hold sanctions violators accountable.   Investigate and end Guinea's role in the Liberian conflict. The U.N. Panel of Experts, which is due to travel shortly to the sub region to examine sanctions compliance, should investigate Guinea's role in contributing to the Liberian conflict and make recommendations to the Security Council.   Mandate the placement of international military observers and human rights monitors on the major route ways along the Guinea/Liberia and Sierra Leone/Liberia borders to monitor cross-border movements.   Request the Secretary-General to fill the vacant position of representative in Liberia, with a mandate to report to the Security Council on the human rights situation in Liberia and make recommendations to end the conflict and address the deteriorating human rights situation.   Expand the mandate of the U.N. Peace-Building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL) to include human rights monitoring and investigation, and the raising of individual cases of abuse with the Liberian authorities and the LURD leadership. Request the U.N. Department of Political Affairs and donor states to increase funding to enable monitors to be deployed wherever security conditions allow.   Call on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to ensure as a priority the civilian nature of the refugee camps in neighboring countries, increase the number of international protection staff, and work closely with neighboring host governments to establish screening mechanisms at the border for refugees fleeing the fighting to separate and provide separate camps for Liberian combatants.   In view of the close links between the Guinean government and the LURD rebel forces in Liberia, the participation of Guinean troops in the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) should be replaced with non-West African troops that are not implicated in the sub-regional conflict. At a minimum, the Guinea battalions should not be deployed near the Sierra Leone/Liberia border where the likelihood of their involvement in Liberian rebel support is higher.   The developing crisis in Liberia, if unchecked and unresolved, threatens to erode the fragile peace and stability so painstakingly established in Sierra Leone, and may likely destabilize Guinea and the wider region.   We thank you for your attention to these important matters.   Yours Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Executive Director Africa Division","Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone",""

The Bulgarian parliament is expected to vote shortly to adopt changes to the country's law on the foreign trade in weapons. Passage of the reforms is a key priority for the Bulgarian government, which has acknowledged that failure to adopt the legislation could derail Bulgaria's bid to join NATO and the European Union. NATO is expected to announce invitations to new members at a summit to be held in November. """"The Bulgarian government has recognized that it has to bring its arms trade under control if it wants to be seen as a reliable international partner,"""" said Lisa Misol, researcher with the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch and author of a 1999 report on Bulgaria's arms trade. """"It has to take responsibility for checking arms deals thoroughly, both before and after the sale, to make sure its weapons don't wind up in the wrong hands."""" Human Rights Watch analyzed the key provisions of the pending legislation, as well as the status of Bulgaria's ongoing reform efforts, in a detailed briefing paper circulated to Bulgarian members of parliament earlier this month, in partnership with the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. The briefing paper highlighted that the legislation, if adopted without changes, would:     * Give greater emphasis to international standards on arms transfers, providing a tool to promote compliance with agreed minimum export criteria Bulgaria has pledged to follow, such as those contained in the 1998 European Union Code of Conduct. The change would not, however, make those commitments binding on the government.     * Impose new controls on the activities of arms brokers. These would cover both Bulgarian and foreign brokers, as well as transport agents and those involved in financing arms deals, and in the case of Bulgarian brokers would also apply to arms deals arranged outside the country.     * Clarify and strengthen regulatory controls to prevent diversion of weapons shipments to unauthorized destinations.       The briefing paper also said the legislation was incomplete in some respects. It:     * Does not provide for sufficient transparency or parliamentary oversight. The government is to prepare an annual report on implementation of the new law and will share it with parliament, but need not make the report public.     * Does not establish rules tailored to address the trade in surplus weapons. As Bulgaria undertakes military reforms tied to its NATO aspirations, it is dumping aging Soviet-standard weapons it no longer needs. While some surplus small arms and ammunition have begun to be destroyed, the bulk of Bulgaria's surplus weapons continue to be available for export.     * Fails to eliminate conflicts of interest that permit government officials with responsibility over arms licensing decisions to serve on the boards of arms companies. Bulgaria's foreign minister recently stepped down from the board of a major arms manufacturing company in the wake of allegations of illegal arms trafficking by the company.  """"Passage of legal reforms is now imminent, but that alone won't guarantee that Bulgaria's arms trade will finally be cleaned up,"""" said Krassimir Kanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. """"The government also needs to show it's serious about fully implementing the controls and prosecuting violators."""" The Bulgarian Helsinki Committee and Human Rights Watch cited a recent case in which Bulgaria sold a 6-gun battery of 130mm artillery pieces to the government of Chad in 2001. The deal was reported in Bulgaria's submission to the United Nations arms register, which tracks only transfers of heavy weapons. The government of Chad has a poor human rights record and armed conflict in the north waged on for years before a shaky peace settlement was signed in January. In addition, Chad recently was implicated in suspected illicit arms deliveries to Liberia, which is under a U.N. embargo. A U.N. report issued in April indicates that suspected arms flights to Liberia in February this year were chartered by the government of Chad and departed from that country's capital. There are also concerns that anticipated oil revenues to the government of Chad could be used to procure more weapons, which would violate the terms of a World Bank agreement financing a new oil pipeline. Both human rights groups called on Bulgarian authorities to investigate to make sure Bulgarian-supplied weapons were not diverted or misused by the government of Chad. They also said Bulgaria should weigh very carefully any future arms contracts with the country. """"The Bulgarian government has promised repeatedly not to sell weapons to human rights abusers, areas of violent conflict, and recipients who may divert the weapons,"""" said Kanev. """"These legal reforms are welcome, but given the long track record of objectionable arms deals, we need to keep a close eye on the country's arms trade.""""

Twenty-seven civilians were killed and about thirty were injured in the attack. All parties to the conflict have an obligation to protect civilian lives,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"Mass, targeted attacks on civilians are intolerable and must be stopped."""" Human Rights Watch urged Indian authorities to undertake a prompt and thorough investigation and that persons implicated in the attack be prosecuted with all due process protections.  According to witnesses interviewed by local journalists, the attack began between 7:00 and 8:00 p.m. when a small group of men carrying bags-and according to some accounts, dressed in the robes of Hindu holy men-threw grenades at a shop in Qasim Nagar, a migrant laborer colony near the Narwal bypass on the outskirts of Jammu. The men then opened fire on civilians who were standing nearby. Some witnesses reported that the gunmen were joined by others who had descended from an overlooking area, and then began firing on civilians in other parts of the colony. The assailants fled after a shootout with the police, reportedly in the direction of the neighboring Bhathandi Rakh forest. Most of the victims were Hindu migrant laborers or their family members from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Orissa in northern and eastern India.  The state police chief, A.K. Suri, told reporters Sunday that Lashkar-e Taiba, a radical Islamist guerrilla group based in Pakistan, was responsible for the attack-a conclusion that he said was based in part on information that the group had been planning attacks in the predominantly Hindu Jammu region. The attack itself was condemned by the All Party Hurriyat Conference, an umbrella organization for the mainstream separatist political leadership in Srinagar, and the United Jihad Council, a grouping of Pakistan-based guerrilla organizations. The government of Pakistan also issued a prompt condemnation of the attack.  The attack is the second mass killing of civilians in Jammu in two months. In May, thirty-two people were killed when three gunmen hijacked a bus, killing seven, and then raided the residential quarters of an army base at Kaluchak. At least eighteen civilians were killed in the raid on the residential compound. The assailants were subsequently killed in an exchange of fire with army commandos. State police later claimed to have identified the gunmen as residents of Pakistan's Punjab province.","Asia, India, Pakistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/16/east-timor-draft-amnesty-law","East Timor- Draft Amnesty Law","East Timor: Draft Amnesty Law","","07/16/2002","The Honorable José Alexandre Gusmão President Democratic Republic of East Timor Dili, East Timor  Dear President Gusmão,  We are writing concerning the draft amnesty law recently presented to the National Parliament for debate (Law No. 5/2002). For more than a decade, Human Rights Watch reported on human rights abuses in Indonesia-occupied East Timor and we continue to follow developments in newly independent East Timor. We are thus aware of the important considerations that led to the proposed amnesty law, including promoting national reconciliation and encouraging the return of refugees. We are pleased to see that the draft law does not confer a blanket amnesty.   We are concerned, however, with a number of specific features of the proposed law, and wish to offer a number of suggestions based on our experience working on similar issues in other countries.   International experience has demonstrated that, even where amnesties are considered necessary after a period of extreme violence, it is critical that the most culpable individuals -- those responsible for the most serious crimes -- are prosecuted and imprisoned. An amnesty that is poorly designed and carried out can undermine genuine reconciliation efforts, weaken the rule of law, and imperil important values, including values such as tolerance, solidarity, and compassion mentioned in the preamble to East Timor's draft amnesty law.   We wish to raise three concerns about the design of the proposed amnesty, as reflected in the draft law: (1) the provisions defining who is eligible for amnesty are broad and confusing; (2) the law appears to treat members of the East Timorese resistance more leniently than it does pro-Indonesia East Timorese, undermining the principle of equal protection of the law; and (3) the law does not address how decisions will be made as to who is eligible for amnesties and who is not, and could lead to violations of due process rights.   Confusing Eligibility Criteria The provisions of the draft amnesty law defining eligibility lack specificity. Article 1 extends amnesty to property crimes committed before May 20, 2002 that """"[did] not involve violence or threats"""" (""""que nao tinham envolvido violencia ou ameaca""""). Article 2 grants amnesty to all crimes committed by Timorese members of pro-integration militias through September 30, 1999, except """"crimes of violence and of blood"""" (""""crimes violentos e de sangue""""). While the decision to make perpetrators of violent crimes ineligible for amnesty is consistent with international standards, key terms such as """"violence"""" and """"crimes of violence"""" are nowhere defined in the draft law.   It is not clear, for example, whether individuals in positions of authority whose subordinates carried out acts of violence but who themselves did not directly engage in violence would be covered by Article 1 or Article 2. It is similarly unclear whether the burning of villages would qualify as a nonviolent property crime covered by the Article 1 amnesty or whether, instead, such acts would be deemed to have """"involved violence"""" or to have carried an implicit threat to the displaced inhabitants of the affected villages. It is also unclear whether pro-integration militia members who helped round up and expel civilians into Indonesian West Timor in September 1999 using physical force where necessary to ensure compliance but generally not physically harming the civilians, would be eligible for amnesty under Article 2. Nor is it clear whether deprivation of liberty constitutes violence.   Because the law lacks specificity, one can expect, at best, long court battles in the future over which crimes qualify for amnesty and which do not. At worst, perpetrators of serious crimes may go unpunished.   Unequal Justice The amnesty for members of the East Timorese resistance in Article 3 appears much broader than the amnesty available to pro-integration East Timorese in Article 2. For example, the Article 3 amnesty would appear to extend to single acts of rape or even non-political murder, such as the killing of a fellow resistance fighter after a personal dispute (a single rape or simple murder committed outside the context of an armed conflict is unlikely to constitute a """"crime of war, of genocide or against humanity""""). Article 2, by contrast, makes anyone guilty of a """"crime of violence and of blood"""" ineligible for amnesty, and would not protect pro-integration militia members who engaged in precisely the same acts.   The fact that the draft law has different rules for resistance fighters and members of pro-integration militias is contrary to the principle of equal protection that underpins the rule of law. We recommend that the same amnesty rules apply to all persons in East Timor.   Lack of Due Process and Transparency The draft law is entirely silent on how decisions will be made as to who is eligible for an amnesty and who is not. Many important issues - for example, whether a particular individual engaged in violent actions, joined a pro-integration militia willingly or was forced to do so, and so on - will undoubtedly be difficult to resolve and will be hotly contested. And there likely will be thousands of such cases. The fact that no decision mechanism is specified means, once again, that one can expect lengthy delays as parties contest amnesty awards or go to the courts to appeal decisions not to grant an amnesty. At worst, the failure to specify a decision mechanism could violate the due process rights of accused individuals.   The legitimacy of the entire amnesty process will be damaged if decisions are not fair and seen to be so by the families of both victims and the accused. We believe that the amnesty law should include detailed provisions on how amnesty decisions will be made, according to what criteria, and by whom. Finally, we are concerned with how the draft amnesty law would affect the newly established Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation. The broad nature of the amnesties and pardons provided for in the law could undermine the Commission's work by removing incentives for individuals to provide information or participate in community rehabilitation efforts. Furthermore, if amnesties or pardons are given prior to actions by the courts or the Commission, the truth of many serious crimes may never be discovered, and the perpetrators never held responsible.   Human Rights Watch recognizes that there are times that amnesties may be considered necessary for political reasons, such as to help end a conflict, or in the case of East Timor, to encourage the return of refugees and displaced persons. But if not carefully designed and carried out, amnesties can both undermine genuine reconciliation efforts and weaken the rule of law. We urge you to continue to solicit the input and views of East Timorese citizens, NGOs and civil society institutions as the process of considering the law goes forward.   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan stated just prior to East Timor's independence that """"true security requires that East Timor balance effectively the twin demands of justice and reconciliation. This is an area where the international community must continue to support East Timorese efforts."""" As the government of East Timor joins the U.N. General Assembly and the community of nations, it has already stated its intention to enforce and uphold internationally-agreed upon standards of human rights, law, and justice.   This is an historic opportunity. By amending the proposed amnesty law to make it consistent with human rights standards, East Timor's leaders and representatives can provide a strong, positive signal of their determination to fully live up to those international commitments.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/16/americas-withdrawal-new-international-criminal-court-justified","Is Americas withdrawal from the new International Criminal Court justified","Is America’s withdrawal from the new International Criminal Court justified?","","07/16/2002","In repudiating Bill Clinton´s signature on the treaty to establish an international criminal court, the Bush administration has taken an audacious step. The move suggests that a radically new vision is guiding American foreign policy: that the United States, with its extraordinary power, is no longer served by the international rule of law. rue, US opposition to the court has not, so far, been couched in these terms. It has tended to focus on the threat that the court might unfairly prosecute an American – even though """"unsigning"""" the court´s treaty only increases that risk. But behind the Bush administration´s decision seems to lie the belief that the US is above international law. A similar resistance to international accountability can be found in its rejection of treaties on climate change, nuclear defence, small arms and biological-weapons inspections. The """"unsigning"""" of the International Criminal Court (ICC) treaty represents the clearest triumph yet of this unilateralist ideology. Before this view becomes entrenched, a debate is urgently needed about whether it in fact serves America´s interest, let alone the world´s. For, if the current trend continues, the US risks finding itself on the wrong side of history. A FAIR TRIAL Tyrants commit genocide and other atrocities when they think they can get away with them. Whereas an ordinary murderer stands a good chance of ending up in prison, the worst that a despot who murders thousands usually has to fear is a comfortable exile in some tropical clime. The ICC attacks this impunity. Since July 1st, when its jurisdiction took effect, anyone who commits genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity faces a far greater risk of arrest, trial and punishment. Most democracies embrace the court as a tool to deter and, if necessary, to prosecute tomorrow´s Saddam Husseins and Pol Pots. The Bush administration says that it endorses this goal in principle, but objects to the court because of the remote possibility that an American might unfairly be brought before it. Admittedly, the US has many enemies who might want to launch an unjustified prosecution. But the court has numerous safeguards against frivolous cases, including extensive due-process rights, narrowly crafted crimes, multiple appeals before independent panels of judges and an emphasis on the worst atrocities. Most important, governments can block the court´s jurisdiction altogether by investigating and, if appropriate, prosecuting their own alleged war criminals – exactly what the US says it already does. Washington claims these safeguards are inadequate, but its concerns crumble under scrutiny. One canard is that the court´s prosecutor will be """"unaccountable"""" to any political body. In fact, the governments that join the court can remove a prosecutor for misconduct by a majority vote. It is difficult to conceive of more direct accountability. Since joining the court means subjecting one´s citizens to its jurisdiction, most of the ratifying governments are democracies – indeed, close US allies. Of course, the prosecutor will not be accountable solely to the US government, but in the eyes of virtually everyone but the Bush administration, this is not a shortcoming. Second, the administration claims that it is unfair to subject Americans to the court´s jurisdiction if the US has not ratified the court´s treaty. But the US would not think twice about prosecuting an Egyptian under an anti-terrorism treaty without Cairo´s consent, or a Colombian under an anti-drug-trafficking treaty without Bogota´s. Similarly, if an American commits an ordinary crime abroad, the foreign government has every right to prosecute him, regardless of Washington´s views. So if an American commits an atrocity abroad, the foreign government should also have the right, without US consent, to delegate its prosecutorial powers to the ICC. This is well within the bounds of how the world already works. Third, some argue that the crimes to be pursued by the court are new-fangled concoctions, offences thought up by academics and non-governmental organisations and foisted on the military. In fact, they can be found in the 1945 Nuremberg charter, the 1948 genocide convention, the 1949 Geneva conventions and the 1977 protocols to those conventions. In each case, the US was intimately involved in drafting the treaty, and has either ratified it or considers relevant parts to be binding customary international law. Some of these rules do reflect a laudatory evolution in international standards since World War II – for example, tougher rules on the indiscriminate bombing of cities – but this has been firmly established for decades. Fourth, the administration argues that the crimes to be addressed by the court are too vague or malleable. But these are the same crimes that the US government requires its own troops to avoid. They have been defined by international treaties, codified in America´s military codes and applied in criminal courts in the United States and around the world for years. They proscribe not only the use of low-tech arms to commit face-to-face massacres, but also the use of high-tech weaponry to kill civilians deliberately or indiscriminately from great heights or distances. During negotiations over the court, the only crime that worried the Pentagon was the prohibition of attacks on military targets that cause disproportionate harm to civilians. It feared that this standard was too subjective to be applied by an international tribunal. The Pentagon´s suggested alternative – that to be prosecutable the damage to civilians must be """"clearly excessive"""" in relation to the anticipated military advantage – was adopted word for word. Of course, even the simplest rule can encounter difficult cases when its application is not self-evident. When criminal prosecution is at stake, the uncertainty of the battlefield usually requires deferring to soldiers´ and commanders´ good-faith efforts to abide by international standards. Certainly, an individual´s freedom should not be sacrificed to 20/20 hindsight or novel interpretations of the law. The ICC´s dependence on its members´ backing for everything from its budget to the arrest of suspects will tend to reaffirm this conservative direction. But deference to good-faith military judgments in close-call cases is quite different from the abdication of review that the Bush administration advocates. In short, the rules for a fair tribunal are in place. The task now is to ensure that they are conscientiously applied. That will depend on the quality of the judges and prosecutor, as well as on the culture of the court. Even without ratifying the court´s treaty, the Bush administration could have had a positive influence on such matters by engaging with the court and offering advice on rules, personnel, procedures and prosecutions. Close US cooperation with the international criminal tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia has helped to build fair and sober institutions. That was demonstrated, for example, when the prosecutor for the Yugoslav tribunal correctly refused to accuse Nato of war crimes in the politically charged matter of the bombing of Yugoslavia. (Nato had violated international humanitarian law, but these violations did not rise to the level of war crimes, despite exaggerated charges by the Yugoslav government and its supporters.) Rather than promote an academic or """"progressive"""" view of the law, the tribunal rightfully kept its analysis within broadly accepted norms. With these advantages of engagement in mind, President Clinton signed the court´s treaty in December 2000. By effectively """"unsigning"""" the treaty in May 2002, the Bush administration squandered that influence and gained nothing in return. Unsigning has not delayed the court´s creation or limited its prosecutorial reach. Already, 76 governments have ratified the treaty – well over the 60 needed to launch the court – and many more are near ratification. If a US soldier commits a war crime or atrocity in the territory of a government that has ratified the treaty, the US will still face the choice between conducting its own investigation (and, if necessary, prosecution) and risking the court´s jurisdiction. Repudiating the court is also likely to impede the US-led anti-terrorism campaign. Washington is asking its allies around the world to cooperate in law-enforcement efforts to track down terrorist suspects. But the administration can only alienate these allies when it opposes a landmark law-enforcement institution for similarly severe crimes. Nor does the administration encourage governments to help it with peacekeeping in Afghanistan when it threatens to destroy peacekeeping elsewhere unless troops are exempted from the ICC´s jurisdiction. ABOVE THE LAW? Why, then, did Washington take this costly step? The Bush administration has put forward several justifications, but none holds water. The most common cites America´s unique responsibility for international security. Because of the extraordinary size and sophistication of its military, the US does indeed bear a special security burden. But only the most ardent unilateralist would suggest that this responsibility should give it a licence to commit war crimes. Besides, the United States is hardly the only government with troops deployed in dangerous war zones. American personnel are a tiny fraction of UN peacekeeping troops, yet other contributing governments accept that, especially when acting in the name of global security, adherence to global standards is essential. Sometimes the administration cites fears about misuse of the crime of """"aggression"""", which, if seven-eighths of its members can agree on a definition of it, the court will be able to prosecute after seven years. Washington claims that this power could be politicised and will infringe on the UN Security Council´s authority to declare an act of aggression. But the court´s treaty requires any definition of aggression to be consistent with the UN Charter, meaning that it must preserve the Security Council´s role. Washington will thus be able to veto any inappropriate allegation of aggression. Another US objection is stated in humanitarian terms: the Pentagon will be reluctant to come to the aid of people in need if it fears unjustified prosecution. But the Pentagon did not think twice about launching bombing campaigns in Bosnia in 1995 and Yugoslavia in 1999, even though this subjected US soldiers to the risk of prosecution by the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. If anything, that tribunal posed greater risks than the ICC: it has primary jurisdiction over any crime it chooses to pursue – that is, it can take a case even if national authorities want to prosecute the matter – whereas the ICC has only secondary jurisdiction, allowing it to address a crime only if national authorities do not. The only thing that has changed since the Bosnian and Yugoslav bombing campaigns has been the administration in Washington. The Clinton administration was willing to live with the small risk of prosecution because it saw international justice as an essential tool for addressing atrocities such as those of Slobodan Milosevic. The Bush administration, by contrast, has allowed its ideological aversion to international justice to prevail. Once one peels away the Bush administration´s various excuses and rationalisations for opposing the ICC, a more disturbing explanation is left. The administration apparently believes that, given the United States´ extraordinary power, the rule of law no longer serves the national interest. Usually, the administration speaks only in terms of not wanting foreign judges to second-guess US military actions. But since no modern conception of justice allows for exempting the most powerful, the administration´s view is really an attack on any rule of law in international relations. The administration correctly observes that Washington can usually get its way on any specific issue through arm-twisting. Why, then, bind the US by international law that might bring about results that are inferior to what Washington could have negotiated on a case-by-case basis? The problem with this reasoning is that no effective global order can rest solely on coercion. Every nation – even a power as dominant as the US is today – benefits from a global order in which most governments abide voluntarily by shared norms, whether of commerce, democracy or peace. Until the arrival of the Bush administration, Washington seemed to understand the importance of promoting such values as respect for human rights and the rule of law, as well as building US military power. Responsible leadership was given as much priority as power. But the Bush administration, intoxicated by America´s unparalleled might, sees little reason to continue submitting to international standards. Its vision of unbridled American latitude is short-sighted. Rejecting American accountability undermines the rule of law and leaves only a system of coercion. That radical vision does not serve America´s interests, and it certainly does not serve the world´s.","United States",""

Human Rights Watch sent a letter this week to President Musharraf urging scrutiny of the role of such councils in abuses against women in Pakistan.  On June 22, during a Mastoi tribal council meeting in the village of Meerwala, in southern Punjab, four men, including one of the tribal council members, allegedly raped Mukhtaran Bibi, a thirty-year-old member of the Gujjar tribe. The rape, which occurred in the presence of a large number of villagers, was intended as """"punishment"""" for the conduct of her brother, Abdul Shaqoor, who had been seen with an unchaparoned woman from the Mastoi Tribe. The woman, Salma Bibi, is now reportedly in police custody with her mother. Mukhtaran Bibi was forced to return home naked after the rape before a crowd of Mastoi villagers. The victim is reported to have said that members of the Mastoi also raped her brother, and that police allegedly asked for a bribe of 11,000 rupees (U.S.$180) for his release from police custody.  """"These tribal councils must not be used as vehicles to deny women their rights and physically assault them,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Pakistani officials must ensure that tribal councils operate in ways that respect the rule of law and women's equality.""""  In its letter, Human Rights Watch said that although a number of individuals identified as perpetrators in the assaults against Mukhtaran Bibi have been arrested, the Pakistan government authorities need to ensure that investigations proceed with respect for due process and accountability for the offenses committed, and provide for the full protection of the victims and their families.  Human Rights Watch also requested clarification on the role of the police in the case, particularly the allegations of bribery by the police and the reported detentions of Abdul Shaqoor, Salma Bibi, and her mother.  In a 1999 report, Crime or Custom: Violence against Women in Pakistan, Human Rights Watch documented the high level of violence against women in Pakistan and the often insurmountable institutional and legal discrimination that impedes and discourages women from seeking justice, and, in the worst cases, traumatizes them further.","Asia, Pakistan","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Security Council resolution on Friday marks the failure of the Bush Administration´s latest effort to permanently exempt Americans from the reach of the International Criminal Court (ICC). The resolution purports only to suspend for one year any ICC investigation or prosecution of U.N. peacekeepers from countries that have not ratified the ICC treaty.   The Bush Administration tried to breach the fundamental principle that no one is above the law,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of International Justice at Human Rights Watch. """"For all its arm-twisting, Washington got only a temporary reprieve of dubious legality and a strong taste of global outrage. The Court will begin its work in a matter of months with greater international support than ever before.""""     The U.S. had sought a resolution that effectively would have exempted peacekeepers from the ICC's jurisdiction indefinitely. Because the resolution would have required a positive vote of the Security Council to allow the ICC to proceed, the U.S. government could have used its Security Council veto to block prosecution forever. The resolution adopted is far weaker. It requires an additional positive Security Council vote to suspend ICC action beyond one year, meaning that no permanent council member acting alone can ensure ongoing suspension.     Instead of a presumption that the suspension would be renewed, the resolution includes only a stated """"intention"""" to renew. If a peacekeeper commits an atrocity during the initial one-year period of suspension and his own government does not prosecute him, that intention could be abandoned. Any seven members of the Security Council or any permanent member using its veto can block council action and enable the ICC to pursue the case.     """"We are not happy that the U.S. has squeezed out a purported deferral of prosecution for peacekeepers- not because we expect peacekeepers to commit heinous crimes - but because no group of people should be even temporarily beyond the reach of international justice,"""" Dicker said. """"On the other hand, weeks of effort to cripple the ICC by obtaining a permanent exemption have ended in failure.""""     Although the Security Council resolution states that it is """"consistent with the provisions of Article 16 of the Rome Statute,"""" that description is inaccurate. The drafters of Article 16 of the ICC treaty clearly intended to allow the Security Council to defer individual investigations and prosecutions for one year only upon consideration of a particular case, not for an entire category of people, such as peacekeepers. The inclusion of cosmetic language that the deferral is activated only """"if a case arises"""" does not obscure the fact that the deferral has been voted in advance. This purported modification of a broadly ratified multilateral treaty is expected to face legal challenge.     The treaty establishing the court took effect on July 1, 2002.

However, we write to express a number of concerns about the role of the police in this case and, more generally, the exercise of authority by tribal councils.  On June 22, during a Mastoi tribal council meeting in the village of Meerwala, in southern Punjab province, four men, including one of the tribal council members, allegedly raped Mukhtaran Bibi, a thirty-year-old member of the Gujjar tribe. The rape, which occurred in the presence of a large number of villagers, was intended as """"punishment"""" for the conduct of her brother, Abdul Shaqoor, who had been seen with an unchaparoned woman, Salma Bibi - who is now reportedly in police custody along with her mother - from the Mastoi tribe. After the rape, Mukhtaran Bibi's attackers forced her to return home naked, passing before a crowd of Mastoi villagers. Mukhtaran Bibi did not initially file a complaint with the police because she and her family feared further reprisals by the Mastoi tribe. Earlier in the day, members of the Mastoi tribe reportedly abducted Mukhtaran Bibi's brother, Abdul Shaqoor, who is between thirteen and fifteen years old, and sodomized him over a period of several hours. Although the police negotiated the release of Shaqoor from his abductors, they failed at that time to launch a criminal investigation or arrest those implicated in his abduction and rape. Shaqoor's family alleges that the police released their son from custody only after the family paid the police a bribe of 11,000 rupees (U.S. $180).  We understand that the local police have arrested a number of individuals identified as perpetrators in the assault against Mukhtaran Bibi. The investigation into this and other related cases should ensure respect for due process and accountability for the offenses committed, and provide for the full protection of the victims and their families.  Human Rights Watch requests clarification of the following matters:  · Have Mukhtaran Bibi and her family been provided with police protection from reprisals for reporting the assault?  · On what legal basis have the local police detained Salma Bibi and her mother?  · Has a police investigation into the assault against Abdul Shaqoor begun? Is an investigation being conducted into reports that police officers demanded bribes from the family of Abdul Shaqoor to secure his release from police custody? On what legal basis was Shaqoor, a victim of sexual violence, detained? Are Shaqoor and his family now receiving police protection from further reprisals by the Mastoi tribe?  We also remain concerned about the broader role of tribal councils in Pakistan and the authority they effectively enjoy to mete out punishments properly reserved to the state.  The authority wielded by these councils has come under strong criticism from national and international human rights organizations. In its 2001 annual report, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan stated that tribal councils in the North West Frontier Province enforced legal punishments with official sanction, including imposing death sentences. Abusive exercise of authority by tribal councils is not confined to remote rural areas, though. In 1998, an Afridi tribal council in Karachi decreed that a young couple, Riffat Afridi and Kunwar Ahsan, should be killed because they married against the wishes of Riffat Afridi's family. Kunwar Ahsan was permanently disabled after being shot by his wife's relatives. The tribal council members vowed to find and kill the couple.  Human Rights Watch believes that it is imperative that government authorities ensure that tribal councils act in accordance with the law and in a manner that respects women's rights, and do not usurp the proper judicial authority of the state. We request that you identify mechanisms by which local administrations in Pakistan can monitor the conduct of tribal councils, and intervene in instances where they have exercised jurisdiction belonging to the state.  We appreciate your attention to these urgent matters and look forward to your response.  Sincerely,  LaShawn R.

The continuing harassment by police of his wife, the outspoken human rights lawyer Radhia Nasraoui, and their daughters must stop. On June 26, Nasraoui launched an open-ended hunger strike calling for the release of her husband and an end to police harassment of the family.  Hammami is the spokesperson of the Tunisian Communist Workers Party (parti communiste des ouvriers tunisiens, PCOT), a party that the government has refused to legalize. He has been in the April 9 Prison in Tunis since February 2, when he emerged from hiding to challenge his conviction in absentia at a 1999 political trial. At that trial, all twenty-one defendants, including Hammami and two others in hiding, had been convicted and all but one sentenced to prison terms.  Human Rights Watch urged the release of the other two defendants from that trial who are also currently in prison, Samir Taamallah and Abdeljabbar Maddouri, as well as Amar Amroussiya, another PCOT member who was jailed on February 2. Hammami is serving a sentence of three years and two months on charges that include membership in a banned organization (the PCOT), distributing leaflets and spreading """"false information"""" capable of """"disturbing the public order,"""" and inciting people to violate the laws of the country. He merits support not only as a person imprisoned solely for his peaceful beliefs and activities but also as a human rights defender. During the many years he spent in various Tunisian prisons since the 1970s, and having undergone various forms of torture at the hands of his captors, Hammami took pains to communicate information about prison conditions and the methods of torture practiced on detainees. Hammami persisted in this monitoring effort at a time when far fewer Tunisians dared to engage in this kind of monitoring activity.  In recent years, Radhia Nasraoui and her daughters have been subjected to obtrusive and intimidating police surveillance, suspicious break-ins at their home and at her law office, as well as travel restrictions at various times. In Tunisia, this sort of harassment is the lot of many human rights activists and their families.

According to eyewitness accounts, a dozen well-organized men severely beat the director and other staff of Liberty Institute and smashed computers, furniture and other equipment.  """"This is one of the most vicious assaults on human rights defenders we have ever seen in the former Soviet Union,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"This attack shows that human rights defenders are at serious risk in Georgia.""""  Human Rights Watch is calling for a thorough investigation and for the results of the investigation to be made public. It is also asking the Georgian government to take special measures to protect human rights defenders.  The attack left Liberty Institute director Levan Ramishvili hospitalized with multiple contusions, eye injuries and speech problems. Five other Liberty Institute members were beaten, one of whom also remains bedridden. One of the staff beaten was a female secretary. Several other staff and visitors avoided beatings by barricading themselves behind doors. The visitors included David Gladwell, a British government official: one of a three-man fact-finding delegation, representing the Council of Europe.  According to eyewitnesses, at about 2:30 p.m. on July 10, from ten to fifteen men between the ages of twenty-five and thirty entered the Liberty Institute office. Liberty Institute activist David Zurabashvili told Human Rights Watch yesterday:  Our office entrance door was open, as it always is. Several men … walked in slowly and calmly. They were hefty, like athletes . . . I got up and asked them what they wanted. Without a word four or five of them came over and started beating me. The others shot off in different directions in small groups. They seemed to know the layout of our office, and were working to a plan. One of the men attacking me had a short rubber truncheon. I felt lots of blood gushing from my nose and fell down. I saw a different group of men beating Levan Ramishvili. When they left me I tried to ring for help, but they had taken my cell phone, and ripped out the office telephone wires.  Sozar Subeliani, another Liberty Institute associate, told Human Rights Watch that he managed to barricade himself behind a door after sustaining an initial beating from men wielding metal knuckledusters:  Then I heard one tell the others: """"Quickly, quickly, destroy everything."""" They smashed up everything in our main office room and then ran away. The whole attack lasted five to seven minutes. When they were out on the street I saw they did not run. They just walked away at a brisk pace.  Last year, on June 3, unknown persons broke into the Liberty Institute office and took its accumulated computer files. They removed the hard disks from all the old computers, but did not touch two recently purchased machines. Liberty Institute staff reported to Human Rights Watch that the deputy chief military prosecutor informed them in November 2001 that an officer of the state defense security service had been arrested in parliament, while trying to use Levan Ramishvili's identity card, which had gone missing in the burglary.  The July 10 attack followed a hostile demonstration two days earlier outside the Liberty Institute office by supporters of Guram Sharadze, a member of parliament with an ultra-nationalist agenda. In a head-to-head television debate about religion several days earlier, Levan Ramishvili had accused Sharadze of inspiring ethnic and religious intolerance and suggested that during the Soviet era he had KGB links. The demonstrators threw eggs and shouted slogans such as: """"This is your final warning.""""  The Liberty Institute has vigorously opposed the rise in religious mob violence and intolerance which Georgia's law enforcement agencies have facilitated and indulged over the last three years, while Sharadze has acted as one of the main public advocates of religious intolerance. In February 2001, the Supreme Court de-registered the Jehovah's Witnesses in response to a civil lawsuit he had brought protesting their registration. During the case and since, Sharadze has propagated demonizing myths about Jehovah's Witnesses that have contributed to the growing climate of violent intolerance. These include unfounded accusations that Jehovah's Witnesses attempted to poison the Georgian bread supply; undertook a mass suicide jump from the ramparts of Gori castle; or have vandalized Orthodox churches and icons.  Earlier on July 8 hundreds of supporters of Sharadze's """"Our Georgia"""" movement rallied at the Shota Rustaveli monument in Tbilisi together with followers of Father Basili Mkalavishvili, the leader of many violent mob attacks on religious minority groups. The speakers vilified the Liberty Institute. Akhali Taoba newspaper quoted one of Sharadze's associates, Elizbar Javelidze, as saying """"What do they look like even physically? Some have big heads and small shoulders, some have dropped jaws, and others roll their eyes."""" Resonansi newspaper reported that Sharadze himself threatened: """"I am going to achieve in the streets whatever I could not achieve in parliament, and I do not mean just demonstrations only.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the Georgian government to improve the climate for human rights organizations in Georgia. In recent months, the government has made moves that some view as hostile to the community of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).  In a speech on April 24, President Eduard Shevardnadze seemed to argue that Georgian NGOs might be financed by international terrorists.

President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, who will tomorrow preside over the formal opening of the newly elected parliament, must set as top priorities steps to establish the rule of law and seek accountability for past abuses. Failure to do so will undermine efforts to establish lasting peace and stability.  “There is still much that stands between Sierra Leone’s painful past and a future based on respect for human rights and the rule of law,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “Justice must be done for past abuses, the judicial system must begin to function, rampant corruption must be eliminated, and the army and police must begin to truly protect and defend the people of Sierra Leone.”  The deployment in Sierra Leone of the UN’s largest international peacekeeping force brought an end to what was one of Africa’s most brutal wars, the disarmament of over 47,000 combatants, the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of displaced civilians, and recent peaceful elections.  But the deeply rooted issues that gave rise to the war — a culture of impunity, widespread corruption, weak rule of law, and the inequitable distribution of the country’s vast natural resources — remain largely unaddressed.  Human Rights Watch underscored the importance of two new institutions established with international assistance, the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The Special Court is charged with bringing to justice those who bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain violations of Sierra Leone law — but has funding only sufficient to try a handful of the many hundreds of people who might be charged. The TRC will seek to establish an impartial historical record of the conflict and promote reconciliation.  Human Rights Watch called on both the Special Court and the TRC to resist any attempts to manipulate their investigations and conclusions. To be credible and effective both institutions must objectively investigate members of all warring factions in Sierra Leone's war.  The TRC is experiencing serious funding shortfalls. Human Rights Watch urged the international and donor community to ensure that it is fully funded, in particular to enable the TRC to address those issues that the Special Court will not be able to. TRC commissioners should investigate and expose collusion between the national army and rebel forces, as well as the involvement of regional players who provided logistical, financial and military support to rebel groups.  The Sierra Leone Army and Sierra Leone Police have over the years been the source of considerable instability, corruption, and human rights violations. “Soldiers and police have enjoyed near complete immunity for all sorts of violations. The impunity must end,” said Takirambudde. The British-led efforts to rehabilitate the beleaguered Sierra Leone army and police and rebuild the judicial system have made a significant impact, and other donors should follow suit.  The new government, together with the international community, must sincerely and without delay confront the problem of corruption, which is endemic within both the public and private sectors. Key indicators of social well being in Sierra Leone, including infant and maternal mortality, illiteracy, and life expectancy have been among the world’s worst for years. Addressing corruption head-on will be an indispensable part of confronting these problems, thereby promoting economic and social rights. Human Rights Watch also warned that sustainable peace in Sierra Leone is dependent upon stability within the countries of the wider region, namely Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia.  The recent renewal of war in Liberia has already drawn in hundreds of former fighters from Sierra Leone who has crossed into Liberia to fight as mercenaries either for the Liberian government or rebels from the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). As a result of the growing number of Liberian refugees and combatants crossing into Sierra Leone, the border area threatens to become unstable.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations"

An arrest order has been also issued for former army chief Gen. Cristino Nicolaides and former Gen. Carlos Suلrez Mason, both of whom are already under house arrest on other human rights charges. Federal judge Claudio Bonadيo has concluded that Galtieri, Nicolaides and Suلrez shared responsibility for the “disappearance” in 1979 and 1980 of eighteen members of the Montoneros guerrilla group, who had returned, or were planning to return, to Argentina. He has also ordered the arrest of about forty lower level police and army agents, most of them attached to the army’s 601st Batallion, a unit responsible for overseas intelligence operations.  “Bonadio’s ruling is an extremely important one,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas division. “Nearly two decades have passed since the Argentine military junta left power; these prosecutions are way overdue.”  The success of these ongoing human rights prosecutions now depends on the Argentine Supreme Court, which must confirm the nullification of Argentina’s amnesty laws.  Judge Bonadيo is one of two Argentine judges who have ruled that Argentina’s amnesty laws (the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, passed in 1986 and 1987) are unconstitutional and violate international norms. In November 2001, the Federal Appeals Court of Buenos Aires upheld the invalidation of the amnesties, but the Supreme Court has still to rule on this issue.  “Bonadيo’s ruling gives added impetus to the courts’ efforts to nullify amnesty laws that violate Argentina’s international human rights obligations and stand in the way of human rights prosecutions,” said Vivanco.

In a new briefing paper released today, Human Rights Watch stressed that European institutions must press Yugoslavia to address serious shortcomings in its human rights record as part of the integration process. Yugoslavia is currently seeking to join the Council of Europe, the European Union Stabilization and Association Process, and the NATO Partnership for Peace, all of which require participating states to respect international human rights standards.     """"There have been obvious improvements since the Milosevic era,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro need to address serious concerns before we can say they have a true commitment to human rights.""""     International organizations should maximize their leverage in the integration process to press for improvements in Yugoslavia, Human Rights Watch said.     The briefing paper details Yugoslavia's poor record on the prosecution of war crimes, police abuse, and protecting the Romani minority from discriminatory treatment.     Since October 2000, when former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic was removed from power, the major abuses of his regime-including harassment of the political opposition and civic activists, restrictions on free speech, politically motivated trials, absolute impunity for war crimes, and persecution of ethnic minorities-have become less frequent or disappeared altogether.     Progress in cooperation with International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) remains slow, however. Yugoslavia continues to shield at least fifteen persons whom the tribunal indicted for war crimes and hinders the tribunal's access to archives and witnesses.     On May 23, the federal minister of the interior suggested only five or six indictees were still in Yugoslavia, yet the same day the head of the investigative office of the Belgrade District Court stated that there was no proof that any indictee had escaped from Yugoslavia.     """"The Minister's statement raises concern that the government is creating an excuse for future inaction with regard to arrests of indicted war criminals,"""" said Andersen.     In spite of the government's rhetorical commitment to domestic war crimes trials, only two are currently under way.     A year after the exhumation of five mass graves in Serbia, containing more than three hundred bodies of Kosovo Albanians killed in 1999, no criminal proceedings have begun and the authorities have not made available information on the identities of the victims or the circumstances in which they lost their lives.     Police abuses against ordinary citizens are still commonplace in Serbia. Serbian human rights groups have registered dozens of cases of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment in 2001 and 2002. The Serbian Ministry of Interior has either ignored the allegations or claimed that it had no knowledge of the alleged incidents. In the four known court decisions since October 2000 dealing with excessive use of force, the convicted law enforcement officials received sentences of less than six months in prison.     Police brutality against Roma is common, and discrimination in various fields of public life remains widespread. Thousands of Romani families live in makeshift settlements, left to survive without electricity, running water, or sewers. Roma displaced from Kosovo are particularly vulnerable to arbitrary evictions from such settlements.     The Human Rights Watch briefing paper recommends specific measures the Belgrade authorities should take to improve Yugoslavia's human rights record. These include, among others, the following:       The government should take immediate steps to apprehend and transfer to the ICTY all remaining indictees at large on Yugoslav territory;     The authorities in Belgrade should take immediate steps to grant the ICTY full and unfettered access to requested documents in the possession of government ministries, and to facilitate ICTY access to potential witnesses;     The prosecutorial offices in Yugoslavia should initiate war crimes proceedings where available facts suggest that war crimes have been committed;     The authorities should end the practice of denying outright the occurrence of police violence and launch criminal investigations when allegations are made, including by human rights groups;     The Serbian Ministry of Interior should undertake a vetting procedure and dismiss law enforcement officials who committed human rights abuses and humanitarian law violations under the government of Slobodan Milosevic;     The government should ensure that reports of police violence against Roma are investigated promptly and impartially, and that those found responsible for the abuses are brought to justice;     The government should adopt effective measures to prevent and punish manifestations of racial bias in the judicial system, including by arranging for training of police, prosecutors, and judges, to educate them in binding international law prohibiting racial and other forms of discrimination, and its applicability in domestic fora.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Last week the Council rebuffed intense efforts by the Bush Administration to undercut the Court by vetoing UN peacekeeping operations in Bosnia.   Human Rights Watch sent a letter this week to Security Council members urging a united front ahead of the Security Council's Wednesday open meeting where states that have ratified the ICC Treaty will articulate their opposition to Washington's efforts to link peacekeeping operation in Bosnia to the ICC. The Council session precedes the July 15 deadline agreed to last week. The mandate for the Bosnia peacekeeping expired on June 21 but has been rolled over twice to allow time for further negotiations.     """"Security Council members should resist the temptation to make an unprincipled compromise,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. has been holding hostage missions that save lives, and holding a gun to the heads of America's closest allies. To give in now would be wrong, it would weaken the ICC, and it would undercut international treaty-making in general.""""     On June 30, Washington vetoed extending the mandate of the Bosnia police operation but according to a subsequent announcement the U.S. will most likely leave in place its forty-six unarmed police trainers, as well as the U.S. contingent of the NATO-led SFOR.     On July 3, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan addressed his concerns in a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, saying, """"the method suggested in the [U.S.] proposal flies in the face of treaty law since it would force States that have ratified the Rome Statute to accept a resolution that literally amends the treaty.""""     Dicker said that casting a veto for future resolutions would be politically much tougher for the Bush Administration, since the U.S. has compelling strategic reasons not to veto the operation in southern Lebanon.     """"The Bush Administration has made its political point by casting a veto. Now let's move on and minimize the fallout by accelerating the transfer of peacekeeping authority to the European Union,"""" said Dicker.     At an extraordinary session of the ICC Preparatory Commission Session meeting in New York on July 3, nearly 120 states articulated opposition to the US approach. Regional groups as well as individual states criticized the attempt to amend the treaty by Security Council resolution.     Human Rights Watch said the new court is the most important new human rights institution in fifty years. The treaty establishing the court took effect on July 1, 2002. The ICC Statute has been signed by 139 countries and ratified by 76 countries.     In May, the Bush administration repudiated the U.S. signature on the ICC treaty.","United States, US Foreign Policy, Global","International Justice, United Nations, International Criminal Court"

The first ingredient: Be sure that sex workers, drug users and men who have sex with men are stigmatized and forced to live in the margins of society. Denying their existence also helps. Second, and this is key: Be sure that those who are brave enough to work with these populations to prevent AIDS are also stigmatized, abused and beaten by the police, thrown in jail on trumped-up charges and accused of being enemies of the state. A third ingredient is optional: Lie about the number of infected people to make it look as though everything is well under control. The Indian government says there are 4 million persons with HIV/AIDS in India, a figure that most experts think is grossly understated. Since the national AIDS program refuses to provide anti-retroviral treatment, prevention is the only hope for the millions at risk of infection. Partly because India is following the how-to-spread AIDS recipe to the letter, it is now home to one of the worst epidemics in the world. The organizations there that are fighting AIDS on the front lines among sex workers and sexual minorities face frequent and violent harassment from the police. The public health service of the government provides these groups with condoms and in some cases money - and then sits back as their work is undermined by police officers who abuse AIDS workers with impunity. Take the case of the aptly named collective of women in prostitution, VAMP, in Nippani near the Maharashtra-Karnataka border. This collective's work is internationally recognized for empowering sex workers to secure condom use by their clients and for AIDS prevention work. It distributes 350,000 condoms per month. The group was broken up by local officials who violently ran its workers out of town. Or take the AIDS educators associated with the Samraksha organization in Bangalore. The police have beaten them, taken their condoms away, accused them of drug offenses for which there was no evidence, and, in one hideous incident, rubbed chili into their eyes and vaginas. Or the groups in several states conducting AIDS prevention work with men who have sex with men, whose workers have been rounded up, sexually abused by police in detention and accused of undermining Indian culture. An antiquated, colonial-era sodomy law, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, is cited as justification by police as they arrest HIV/AIDS educators who work with men who have sex with men. The Delhi High Court is considering a petititon by Naz Foundation India Trust to repeal this law. The World Bank is the main funder of the national AIDS program, having lent India more than $300 million for the effort so far. The terms of the loan include ensuring respect for the rights of persons at high risk of HIV transmission, but the bank has done little to ensure that this provision is enforced. It is time for the government to make protection of the rights of high-risk persons and those who provide AIDS prevention services to them a centerpiece of its AIDS program. Repealing Section 377 would be a good start.  *The writer, Joanne Csete, who directs Human Rights Watch's HIV/AIDS and Human Rights program, contributed this comment to the International Herald Tribune.","Asia, India","Health, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Increased international mobilization, particularly the XIV International Conference on AIDS in Barcelona, is crucial, but one acutely vulnerable group continues to suffer in silence - adolescent girls at risk of infection by sexual violence and other abuses. With prevalence rates in several heavily affected countries five times higher than for boys, protecting girls should be a prime objective. Decisive steps now at the national and international level could have real impact, with relatively minimal financial cost. On a recent trip to Zambia, I interviewed scores of girls impacted by HIV/Aids, ranging from discrimination in access to education to attacks on street children to sexual violence and coercion. These human rights abuses put girls at direct risk of infection, and must be addressed as part of the solution to the broader pandemic. Alarming numbers of girls are targets of sexual violence, frequently by HIV-positive men. Some men seek out younger and younger girls in the hope that they will be Aids-free; others look for young girls based on the myth that having sex with a virgin will cure them of the disease. The low social and legal status of women and girls makes it exceedingly difficult for them to negotiate safe sex and to take steps to protect themselves from STDs or HIV infection. The perpetrators of these abuses are not only unscrupulous older men, referred to as """"sugar daddies,"""" who coerce girls into sexual relations with offers of gifts and money. The tragic reality is that many abusers are precisely the adults with responsibility for caring for these children, such as close relatives and teachers. They use their power and status to compel girls to comply, underscored by threats of violence or abandonment if they refuse. One of the girls I interviewed was Carol (not her real name), 17 years old and in grade 9, with a direct gaze. After her parents died, she went to stay with her aunt, but she told me: """"I stayed with her, but then my uncle started sexually abusing me. He was about 34. He threatened he'd kill me if I told anyone about it."""" She went on to describe her fear: """"I want to go for a test to see if I'm OK or not. I feel if it can happen to me, it can also happen to other girls my age. People like that are so cruel - they should be locked behind bars."""" In most cases, victimized girls remain silent in the face of a legal and social system that fails to act to protect the girls' rights. Indeed, the obstacles that a girl would have to overcome in Zambia to report a case of rape or defilement appear overwhelming: she would face a police department that is rarely child or gender sensitive, a medical establishment that often scolds her for being promiscuous, a court system lacking any facilities for youths, and a societal structure that teaches girls to be submissive to men. Even if she did report an abuse, chances that officials would act against the abuser are minimal. As a result, the perpetrators remain free to abuse, and to infect, again. Tragically, the spread of HIV/Aids to girls is the result of more than just shortcomings in the justice system. In the worst affected areas of southern Africa, hundreds of thousands of children are Aids orphans, with girls bearing the brunt of the burden of caring for ailing parents and taking responsibility for their siblings. These girls are usually the first to drop out of school, which further reduces their access to information and their economic and social ability to protect themselves against HIV infection. All too often, they end up on the streets and engage in high-risk sex work as their only economic alternative. Cases abound of girls trapped in abusive situations with a high risk of contracting HIV/Aids and virtually no ability to protect their rights. One vivacious and articulate 16- year-old to whom I spoke, Patricia (not her real name), lost both her parents. After her mother died, her uncle sexually abused her. Because he has been sick, the counselors working with Patricia are encouraging her to get an HIV test. She described her situation and that of many other girls: """"After my mother died, I went to my mother's mother. In 2001, she died, so I stopped school, because I had no more sponsor. Then we went to my auntie, my mom's younger sister... Most girls find that they start keeping up [sleeping with] with stepfathers or uncles. Most are raped. They have no say. If you bring them to the police, there will be no one to keep me. So they keep quiet..."""" Another 16 year old, let's call her Martha, lost her mother and went to live with her grandmother, but was being sexually abused by a neighbor. Others in the community ultimately reported her case, and she was sent to an orphanage. The orphanage was concerned because she was always sick, and she tested positive for HIV. These all-too-common stories highlight the complexity of risk and transmission related to HIV/Aids. And they pose a clear challenge to the global response to the pandemic. To a large extent, the remedies required to protect millions of other girls in Africa are not outrageously expensive, nor do they require a massive overhaul of the justice system. In most African countries, the laws are on the books - they need to be enforced. The police need special training in gender violence and child abuse, as do medical professionals and educators. Abuses against girls must be investigated and prosecuted, and stiffer punishments meted out. Preventive administration of a short course of anti-Aids drugs should be given to rape victims, as it is in many countries. Communities need to be empowered to recognize and act upon signs of abuse. Governments, schools and communities should increase programs to keep girls in school and in a safe environment. Allowing girls to suffer in silence not only perpetuates serious human rights violations, it facilitates the transmission of HIV. International and national policymakers meeting in Barcelona should muster the political will and take the steps necessary to break this cycle of abuse and transmission. *Janet Fleischman, is Human Rights Watch's Washington Director for Africa.

The United Nations continues to sound a warning that AIDS in Asia may even dwarf the calamity the disease inflicted on Africa unless governments step up their responses. AIDS experts in Asia often point to the success of Thailand's mobilization in the 1980s to contain what was one of the world's fastest growing epidemics. A hallmark of the Thai experience was the recognition of the importance of working with organizations of sex workers and other groups representing high-risk persons. These positive examples should be highlighted at the International AIDS Conference now under way in Barcelona. Elsewhere in Asia, the fight against AIDS is in trouble. India has what could soon be one of the worst AIDS epidemics in the world, but the Indian government is shooting its own AIDS program in the foot. National authorities are allowing a police force long out of control to undermine the successful, pioneering work of nongovernmental organizations among people who are at high risk from AIDS. Take, for example, Vamp, the apt acronym for a collective of women in prostitution or sex workers based in Nippani, Karnataka state. The women of Vamp represent the best hope for preventing HIV/AIDS deaths in India and a community that faces official abuse and stigmatization every day. Over the years and against all odds, Vamp and its parent organization Sangram built a network that provided 350,000 condoms every month and continuous HIV/AIDS information to prostitutes, their clients and the broader community. Enabling sex workers to act as a collective, giving them the power as a group to demand that their clients use condoms, was a brilliant strategy. Vamp is a stunning AIDS success story. Recently, police began harassing, humiliating and violently seeking to break up the Vamp collective, apparently because it had become stronger and had purchased a house that gave it a higher profile in the community. Vamp members were run out of the town where they had worked for years, threatened by armed thugs, refused the privilege of filing official complaints because they are not """"normal citizens"""" and otherwise stripped of their rights and possessions. When the dust settled, the big winner was HIV/AIDS, whose most effective front-line foes in Nippani were wiped out in a stroke of official prejudice, judgmentalism and violence. Thanks to strong allies in many of the communities it touches, Vamp may be on the way to regaining its former strength, but its story is not isolated in India. Outreach workers in Samraksha, an organization with an impressive track record of AIDS prevention among prostitutes in Bangalore, suffered 27 incidents of police abuse from December 2001 to April 2002, including cases of AIDS educators sadistically abused in detention and others detained on trumped-up drug charges. Peer educators working with sex workers in two locations in Tamil Nadu also suffered severe beatings at the hands of local police, arbitrary arrest and inhumane conditions in detention in recent months. Similar police harassment is faced by AIDS organizations around the country that are providing life-saving AIDS prevention services. """"It's all about the police getting money and free sex,"""" said an AIDS outreach worker in Tamil Nadu who, like many others, had his AIDS work interrupted by being arrested and detained for """"promoting homosexuality"""" just because he provided condoms and information on HIV to men who have sex with men. The Indian penal code doesn't help. Section 377 of the code, based on a 19th-century British law, effectively criminalizes sex between men. This law and a long history in India of marginalization of men who have sex with men give police enormous leeway to harass, arrest and detain these men and also HIV/AIDS educators who reach out to them. The Naz Foundation (India) Trust, a New Delhi-based organization, now has a petition before the New Delhi High Court to repeal section 377. It would make sense for the state and central-level leaders of government AIDS programs, as well as the United Nations and all the donor countries investing in AIDS work in India, to trumpet their support of section 377's repeal, which would dramatically improve the environment for AIDS prevention in this high-risk group. But so far the silence has been deafening. The World Bank underwrites India's national AIDS program with a $191 million loan. In the loan agreement, the bank and the government of India both pledged to respect the human rights of """"marginalized groups at high risk"""" of HIV transmission, but there is no sign that any resource is being spent to monitor human-rights abuses suffered by these groups and by AIDS outreach workers who aim to assist them. The investment made to combat the epidemic by both the Indian government and donor institutions in India will go down the drain if the police continue abusing AIDS outreach workers and those they serve. The Barcelona AIDS conference should send a wake-up call to the Indian government and its donors, reminding them that the fight against AIDS must also be a fight to protect human rights. --- *Ms. Csete is director of the HIV/AIDS and human rights program at Human Rights Watch in New York and the author of a just-released report on violence against AIDS workers.","Asia, India","Health, Women's Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

The new regional grouping is being launched this week in Durban. The African Union’s Constitutive Act pledges respect for human rights and rejects the widespread impunity that has characterized armed conflict and political repression in many African countries. In “grave circumstances” such as occurred during the Rwandan genocide, the Constitutive Act authorizes the African Union to intervene. But the existing regional human rights institutions the African Union will inherit have been crippled by a lack of resources and political will.  Leading African states in the African Union have also adopted a New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), a program to lift Africa out of poverty that explicitly recognizes the importance of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law for economic development. NEPAD has also developed its own code of governance and system for “peer review,” but its pledges on human rights remain vague.  “The African Union will only succeed if it replaces the culture of impunity with the culture of accountability,” said Peter Takirambudde, director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “That means making sure the nice words of its Constitutive Act and of NEPAD come to life and that there are consequences if states don’t live up to what they say they will do.”  Human Rights Watch called on African Union members to follow through on human rights pledges they have already made. For a start, they should:  · urgently finalize a strong protocol to the African Charter on women’s rights, negotiations on which have been stalled for months; · ratify the protocol establishing an African Court on Human and People’s Rights, which could award judgments against states for human rights abuse; · give Africa’s existing human rights body, the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights, the resources and political backing needed to carry out its mandate.  At the G8 summit last month in Kananaskis, G8 leaders committed support for the NEPAD initiative, but adopted a wait-and-see approach to the system of peer review. The G8 leaders said they would make their own assessments in deciding whether to develop partnerships with particular countries.  “Peer review is a positive step, but only if the process is transparent and given teeth,” said Takirambudde. “It must be backed up by institutions that can ensure proper scrutiny and enforcement of human rights.”  South Africa will be the first chair of the African Union, and Human Rights Watch urged President Thabo Mbeki to take a lead in ensuring human rights are at the core of the new body’s activities over the next year.","Africa",""

The Human Rights Watch report, """"Discretion Without Bounds: The Arbitrary Implementation of Spanish Immigration Law,"""" criticizes the Spanish authorities' uncoordinated and ad hoc application of Spanish Law 8/2000. The report criticizes the arbitrary treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in Spain-in airports, in Madrid, along the Andalucian coast, in the two Spanish cities in North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla), and in the Canary Islands.  At their meeting in Seville on June 21-22, European Union heads of state discussed further measures to control immigration. """"We are seriously concerned that the E.U.'s measures will only worsen the kinds of treatment we have documented in Spain,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch researchers found that in Spain the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers is primarily dependent on their point of entry into the country, regardless of the fact that Spain's immigration and asylum laws should be applied uniformly throughout the country.  Researchers found that in the case of certain migrant groups, particularly Algerians, the Spanish authorities use informal procedures to determine their country of origin, sometimes resulting in unreliable and arbitrary decisions. Human Rights Watch also documented disturbing violations of migrants' and asylum seekers' procedural rights, particularly their rights to information in a language they understand, meaningful legal and translation services, and an opportunity to appeal.  Human Rights Watch is concerned that the Spanish government has recently focused its efforts on immigration control and speeding the process for migrants' expulsion and deportation, rather than on the serious human rights abuses Human Rights Watch and other groups have identified. Human Rights Watch calls on the Spanish government to:  take prompt measures to address the deficiencies of coordination among central, regional, and local authorities in order to ensure the fair and consistent interpretation of the rights of migrants under Law 8/2000 and its regulation;  ensure that the foreigner's law is applied in a nondiscriminatory manner, including the creation of clear guidelines for identification procedures;  provide all arriving migrants and asylum seekers with information pamphlets on the Spanish immigration procedure and their rights under Spanish, regional, and international law in a language they understand;  provide training on immigration and asylum law for lawyers representing migrants and ensure that migrants have a meaningful opportunity to seek legal assistance and to secure adequate legal representation for all processes governing their rights and status; and  ensure that every migrant subject to a return procedure in Spain receives a full and fair individual determination with respect to repatriation, deportation, or expulsion.","Europe/Central Asia, Spain","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

The four are being held in incommunicado detention by the Liberian government, and may be at risk of torture and ill-treatment. The government has twice disregarded a court order to bring the detainees into court. Hassan Bility, the editor of one of Liberia’s most independent newspapers, was arrested on June 24, 2002, together with Ansumana Kamara, Abubakar Kamara, and Blama Kamara. The detainees were taken to an unknown destination by two plain-clothes men reportedly from the Criminal Investigations Division of the police.  At the time, Minister of Information Reginald Goodridge issued a public statement announcing that Bility and the others were being held on suspicion of operating a rebel terrorist cell in Monrovia.  “Hassan is the most recent victim of the Liberian government’s crackdown against the independent media,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “His detention is intended to send the message that criticism of the Liberian government — or indeed even press coverage of that criticism — will not be tolerated.”  Over the past year, Hassan Bility has been interrogated and detained twice, and his newspaper, The Analyst, has been closed down twice, as the result of publishing articles deemed critical of the government.  In May 2002, Bility received a telephoned death threat from a colonel in the Liberian National Police who warned him that those who were writing articles critical of the president would be dealt with. The threat came after The Analyst covered a speech made by leading human rights lawyer Tiawan Gongloe on the role of civil society groups in bringing peace to the sub-region. As a result of the speech, Tiawan Gongloe was held in unlawful detention and tortured in April 2002 before being released without charge, and The Analyst was shut down briefly by the government. Although the government initially acknowledged it was holding Hassan Bility and the others in custody, it has been impossible to determine which security agency is holding them or to obtain access to them. The government has twice failed to honor a court order that the detainees be produced in court. At both hearings, state lawyers have denied that the detainees are in state custody, despite the Information Minister’s press conference the day the accused were arrested, stating that the accused were undergoing “investigation at the National Security Agency” for a plot to “assassinate the person of the president and destabilize the state.”  State lawyers have also argued, in contradiction, that Bility need not be produced in court since he is an “illegal combatant,” and should therefore be brought before a military tribunal.  “Especially given Liberia’s recent history of seeking to quash public criticism, it increasingly appears Bility’s arrest on suspicion of operating a rebel terrorist cell in Monrovia is merely another effort to silence him,” said Takirambudde.  In the face of a rebel incursion since mid-2000, the government of Charles Taylor has become increasingly intolerant of dissent. Following the imposition of a state of emergency in February 2002, Liberia has intensified its harassment of civil society groups and the independent media. Additionally, members of the Mandingo and Krahn have been singled out for indiscriminate persecution based on their ethnicity, since many of the rebel fighters are Mandingo or Krahn. All four detainees are Mandingo.","Africa, Liberia","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Effort Criticized","07/03/2002","The United Nations and the Angolan government are not providing sufficient protection for hundreds of thousands of people displaced during Angola’s civil war, Human Rights Watch said in a briefing paper released today. Today, the U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Kenzo Oshima, begins an assessment mission to Angola. On July 11, the U.N. Security Council is expected to discuss renewing the mandate of the U.N. Office in Angola.  Internally displaced people (IDPs) in Angola continue to face serious security threats, including harassment by government forces, restrictions on free movement, and possible forced return to areas where they would be at risk of political persecution and human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch said. Hundreds of thousands continue to live in poor conditions in government-run camps without access to basic food or medical care.  Oshima’s visit comes just before a formal resettlement process for IDPs in Angola begins.  “Nobody in Angola should be forced to move against their will,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “The U.N. and the Angolan government have plans on paper to protect the internally displaced population, but these laws and programs are not being implemented on the ground.”  There are several U.N. agencies working with the internally displaced in Angola, but there is no single U.N. agency with clear formal responsibility for protection of internally displaced persons — contributing to the neglect they have suffered. Currently, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (OCHA), of which Kenzo Oshima is the head, is responsible for overall coordination of initiatives to assist IDPs, including protection, but OCHA in Angola is already overstretched and does not have real expertise in protection work, Human Rights Watch said.  Since the death of rebel leader Jonas Savimbi in February, Angola has made rapid progress towards ending thirty years of conflict. But despite a ceasefire agreed in April and progress in negotiating a permanent peace, the need for attention to the displaced has become, if anything, more urgent. As access to previously rebel-held areas opens up, there has been a rise in the number of Angolans seeking immediate assistance, exacerbating the humanitarian crisis and raising the specter of new human rights abuses.  As many as one-third of Angola’s thirteen million people are internally displaced; another 435,000 Angolans fled the country altogether during the war and became refugees abroad.  Human Rights Watch said that in principle it considers the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to be the most appropriate U.N. agency to assume operational responsibility for the protection of IDPs in Angola, based on its practical protection experience and expertise with forcibly displaced communities. However, UNHCR has been forced to phase out its involvement with IDPs in Angola, following the termination of United States and Japanese support for the program.  As OCHA is currently the only U.N. agency on the ground in Angola with the capacity to provide oversight and carry out protection work, Human Rights Watch urged that OCHA continue with its protection activities for IDPs in Angola. In the absence of UNHCR protection officers in all the provinces, OCHA should also assume responsibility for taking up individual protection cases and raising grievances with the government authorities. Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR to include protection for IDPs in its refugee repatriation programs and called on donor governments to provide funding for this.  Human Rights Watch also called on the U.N. Security Council to include clear provisions for protection of IDPs in the resolution it will be discussing on July 11.","Africa, Angola","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Internally Displaced People"

Both parties should agree on human rights safeguards to help resolve two decades of bitter conflict over political control of the island's Tamil-dominated north and east. Face-to-face negotiations, though subject to repeated delays, are expected to be held in Thailand, possibly as early as July. In a nine-page background paper released today, Human Rights Watch supported calls by Sri Lankan human rights defenders, peace activists, clergy, and academics for formal human rights commitments from both parties and the establishment of a system of independent human rights monitoring early in the process, before discussion of administrative arrangements get underway. The first round of talks is likely to focus on the establishment of an interim administration for the north and east; if talks succeed, the LTTE is expected to take a leading role in civil administration.  """"This conflict has been driven by grave abuses of human rights on all sides,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"Ensuring that abuses stop must necessarily be central to its resolution."""" A cease-fire since last December has given civilians a much-needed respite from war-related violence and security restrictions that have inhibited their freedom of movement, crippled the local economy and promoted abuse. The lull also encouraged cautious new demands for democratic openness within the Tamil community -- long dominated by the LTTE's political agenda. But the LTTE has ratcheted up pressure on both civilians and critics, and hopes have faded that the cease-fire, negotiated with Norway acting as a mediator, would guarantee space for independent activity in the Tamil community.  """"The role of independent monitors is crucial, and cannot be left in the hands of anyone with a political interest in the outcome of negotiations,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Accountability for abuses is also important.""""  Despite repeated promises by the LTTE to end their use of child soldiers and to halt extortion of money and property from civilians in the north and east, these practices have continued. Human Rights Watch has received numerous reports of such incidents since February. Renewed promises made by the LTTE in June 2002 to stop recruiting children and to return all underage recruits to their families need to be closely monitored.  """"The LTTE must end the recruitment of children for military purposes and their use in hostilities. Child soldiers should be demobilized, and given assistance to return to their communities,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.  Human Rights Watch also pointed out the urgent need to eliminate or reform the government's Prevention of Terrorism Act and to release the hundreds of detainees held by the Sri Lankan authorities without trial under its draconian provisions. Most of these detainees are Tamils arrested on suspicion of links to the LTTE. Many of them were arrested months or even years ago pending investigation, with no evidence to support police suspicions beyond their own confessions - often extracted under torture.","Asia, Sri Lanka",""

Security Council rejected a U.S. proposal that would have exempted peacekeepers from the authority of the International Criminal Court. Council members agreed to extend the authorization for Bosnia peacekeeping by July 15.     """"This court was founded on the principle of universal justice, and that principle is under attack from ideologues in the Bush administration,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the international justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"The Security Council was right to rebuff those attacks. We hope that they hold firm in the days to come.""""     The US proposal would have exempted from the court's jurisdiction, for an initial period of one year, officials involved in peacekeeping from governments that have not ratified the court's treaty. Even more important, the exemption would remain in effect indefinitely until the Security Council votes to lift it, meaning that any single permanent member of the Security Council could use its veto to block prosecution forever.     The exemption would be valid even if the peacekeepers were responsible for crimes committed in a country that has ratified the treaty.     Under Article 16 of the treaty establishing the International Criminal Court, the Security Council may request the court to suspend any """"investigation or prosecution"""" for a one-year renewable period. But that provision requires the positive vote of the Security Council each year, meaning that any of the five permanent members could veto a continued deferral, and allow the court to prosecute.     The U.S. proposal, by contrast, would keep the suspension in place permanently until a positive vote of the Security Council decided otherwise. That would allow Washington to permanently block ICC investigation of anyone involved in operations sponsored or authorized by the U.N.     The U.S. proposal would also weaken Article 27 of the treaty, which establishes the """"irrelevance of official capacity."""" This provision allows someone like Slobodan Milosevic, former President of Yugoslavia, to be prosecuted even though he might claim head-of-state immunity under national or international law. The U.S. proposal would send the disturbing signal that certain persons, based on their official capacity as peacekeepers, could be above the law.     The U.S. proposal would also alter the jurisdiction of the court: under the ICC treaty, if genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity are committed on the territory of a State Party, the court would have jurisdiction over the accused regardless of his or her nationality, and every State Party would have an obligation to surrender an accused to the ICC. In creating an exemption for peacekeepers, the U.S. proposal would alter those fundamental obligations.     """"The treaty's drafters resisted years of U.S. pressure to insist that no single government could manipulate the court's docket,"""" said Dicker. """"If countries capitulate to U.S. pressure now and hand decisions on peacekeeper prosecutions to each single permanent member of the Security Council, the council breaches that important principle.""""     Dicker said the use of the Security Council to rewrite a multilateral treaty set a dangerous precedent far beyond the harm it may do to the ICC. The ICC treaty says that seven-eighths of all the State Parties have to vote for any amendment to the treaty. The United States is now trying to change the treaty using its muscle at the U.N. Security Council.     In May, the Bush administration repudiated the U.S. signature on the ICC treaty. In addition to its campaign at the Security Council to exempt peacekeepers from the court's jurisdiction, Washington has been working to undermine the Court's jurisdiction over U.S. troops stationed abroad on the territory of governments that have ratified the court's treaty.     Human Rights Watch has hailed the new court as the most important new human rights institution in fifty years. The treaty establishing the court took effect on July 1, 2002. The ICC Statute has been signed by 139 countries and ratified by 76 countries.     At stake, Human Rights Watch said, is both the court's independence and its ability to apply the rule of law without distinction on the territory of ratifying governments.     """"It is sad that the historic achievement of creating the Court is being threatened by the actions of one government,"""" said Dicker. """"Rather than focusing on the goals of the court - to prosecute future Pol Pots or Saddam Husseins - the U.S. government has fixated on guaranteeing itself an ironclad exemption from the Court's jurisdiction. The U.S. attempted to achieve that result when the ICC treaty was drafted in 1998, and failed. It must not be permitted to do so now.""""","United States, US Foreign Policy, Global","International Justice, United Nations, International Criminal Court"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/07/03/reforming-bulgarias-arms-trade","Reforming Bulgarias Arms Trade","Reforming Bulgaria's Arms Trade","","07/03/2002","In the next few weeks, the Bulgarian parliament is due to enact important changes to the country's arms trade law. The legislation would amend the Law on the Control of Foreign Trade Activity in Arms and Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, which was adopted in 1995. The anticipated changes are motivated in large part by Bulgaria's desire to reassure international partners that it is doing all that it can to rein in the arms trade. The legal reforms now awaiting passage represent an effort to put to rest Bulgaria's reputation as a no-questions-asked arms supplier, a reputation well-deserved during the Cold War and through the end of the 1990s. In the past two years the country has made some progress in bringing its arms trade under greater control. The legal reforms intended to institutionalize and expand the progress to date are incomplete in some respects, but are an important step in the right direction. In addition, government action in the face of recent cases of suspected illicit arms trading is welcome. These responses, however, have been insufficient for the Bulgarian government to fully establish its credibility in ending impunity for illicit arms traders. At the same time that Bulgaria works to put in place a strong legal framework, its government also needs to demonstrate a sustained commitment to the strict implementation of controls and a greater emphasis on prosecution of violators. Only with action on all three fronts can the government ensure that the arms trade is brought fully under control. Pressure for Legal Reform Passage of arms trade reforms is long overdue. Legislative proposals to tighten arms trade controls have been under discussion in Bulgaria for more than three years. A previous government first proposed legislative changes in December 1998, but these were never adopted. The proposal currently under consideration was introduced to parliament in February 2002 by the government that came to power in mid-2001. That the adoption of arms trade reforms now seems imminent after similar changes lagged for years is a reflection of the importance of reform to Bulgaria's international aspirations. The government knows it must shake its reputation as an irresponsible arms supplier. Failure to do so could fatally undermine the country's prospects of entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union (E.U.).1 NATO is anticipated to announce invitations to new members at a summit to be held in November 2002. The importance of NATO and E.U. leverage could not be more clear. When introducing the proposed legal changes to parliament on February 4, 2002, the Bulgarian prime minister explained his government's motivation:  The refinement of the Bulgarian system of export control is of key importance to the negotiations of our country for EU membership, particularly in connection with Chapter 27 """"General Foreign and Security Policy,"""" as well as to the fulfillment of the Membership Action Plan (MAP) in NATO. The necessity for the planned changes to take effect in the Bulgarian legislation is explicitly pointed out in the annual regular reports from the European Commission on the progress made by the Republic of Bulgaria as regards the EU membership criteria, as well as in NATO's annual reports on the progress achieved by Bulgaria in fulfilling the MAP. In the implementation of this legislative initiative of the executive power, a key problem in the NATO and EU accession process shall be solved.  Although key legal reforms have thus far lagged in Bulgaria, some positive changes have nevertheless been put into place. Bulgaria has moved to tighten controls partly in response to revelations that in the late 1990s the country was a source of arms flows to an embargoed rebel group responsible for gross human rights abuses in Angola. This had long been suspected, but in a 2000 report U.N. investigators reported that the bulk of the arms illicitly supplied to the Angolan rebels at least as of 1997 had originated in Bulgaria. The U.N. documented thirty-eight arms flights to the rebels from the airport at Burgas from 1997-1998. Bulgarian authorities had long asserted that they had never authorized exports to an embargoed party and that Bulgaria bore no responsibility for where its weapons wound up after they left its territory. In this case, however, the seriousness of the allegations and the threat they posed to Bulgaria's international standing helped contribute to a shift in official thinking and to crystallize political will to better control arms exports. Adopting a more constructive approach, Bulgaria set out to identify the weaknesses that illicit arms traffickers had been able to so readily exploit, and to work to correct them. The case also helped prompt international technical assistance to assist the Bulgarian government in its efforts. Improvements to Date  Beginning under the previous government, Bulgaria began to tighten the implementation of national regulatory controls and took other steps to rein in the arms trade. Further work is needed to detect and prevent illegal transactions, as discussed below, but the improvements registered thus far indicate that the political will to improve controls has improved, as compared to the past, and that the country's regulatory capacity is on the rise. Stricter Implementation of Controls Bulgarian officials announced in early 2001 before the U.N. and in other fora that the government had initiated serious efforts to evaluate more closely applications for arms export licenses, coordinate the inter-agency review better, and more carefully consider the risk that the weapons might be diverted to unauthorized destinations. They indicated that they were paying particular attention to arms deals to countries in Africa and Asia near embargoed countries or otherwise found to be high-risk. As a part of this effort, the Bulgarian government started taking more seriously the need to authenticate the documents provided by arms traders and brokers, particularly the so-called end-user certificate or EUC that declares the ultimate purchaser of the weapons. EUCs are notoriously easy to forge, or to obtain from corrupt officials who provide false cover for arms clients that are under embargo. Unscrupulous arms brokers often taken advantage of weaknesses in end-user controls in exporting countries by submitting false or misleading information. (This had been the case with the arms shipments to Angolan rebels, for example.) At least in some cases, Bulgaria also began to require proof of delivery after the weapons were cleared for export, to check that they were delivered to the proper destination and not diverted en route. Seeking to close a major loophole, the government undertook to establish administrative procedures to register arms brokers. (The current proposal on brokering is described below.) Internationally declared arms embargoes also received greater attention, and in this case formal action was taken to institutionalize the change. In April 2001 the then-government enacted a decree implementing a number of U.N. and E.U. embargoes and other multilateral restrictions, thereby incorporating into law restrictions on arms sales to twenty countries. With this step the measures gained the national legal status needed to allow for prosecution in case of violations. In 2001, the government adopted legislation providing that all U.N. arms embargoes and other binding decisions of the U.N. Security Council be automatically implemented into national law, and this legislation is now force in Bulgaria. Destruction of Surplus Weapons More recently, Bulgaria has begun to destroy some of its vast stockpile of surplus weapons, those no longer needed by the military as it reduces the size of its force and seeks to modernize its equipment in preparation for possible NATO membership. Many of the customers for cheap, Soviet-standard weapons are often located in areas of violent conflict in poorer parts of the world, including Africa. Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and the Republic of Congo (Congo-Brazzaville) have been among the clients for Bulgaria's surplus arms since 1999. The new weapons destruction program, implemented as of early 2002 with U.S. financing, has thus far destroyed more than 77,000 small arms and approximately 500 tons of ammunition. These have been the oldest weapons, those with the lowest value and lowest export potential (some of the arms date to World War II), but it is hoped that destruction of some export-quality weapons will begin under a new contract. No funding has been made available thus far that would also provide for the destruction of heavy conventional arms, as called for by Human Rights Watch in interventions to the countries of the E.U. and NATO. Bulgaria's remaining nuclear-capable missiles are to be destroyed with U.S. assistance provided under a program to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Improved Law Enforcement Capacity Bulgaria also has registered some improvements in the area of law enforcement. The government, for example, has taken up offers, extended by international partners, for training programs and upgraded equipment to enhance border and customs controls, as well as to improve coordination among agencies involved in licensing and monitoring arms exports. The Bulgarian authorities have detected some suspicious deals, halting an arms delivery in 2001 and revoking licenses of companies suspected of engaging in illegal activities. These cases, none of which has led to criminal prosecutions, are highlighted below. Legal Reforms: Provisions Awaiting Enactment The proposals before parliament address a number of topics, ranging from a strengthened commitment to uphold international obligations to the introduction of controls on arms brokers. In several respects the changes correspond to recommendations made by outside observers, including Human Rights Watch in a 1999 report, and which were rejected at the time by the Bulgarian government. The inclusion of such measures helps demonstrate the extent to which the debate on reform has advanced in the past two years. The analysis that follows is based on draft legislative text updated as of March 2002, the Act on the Amendment of the Foreign Trade in Arms and Dual-use Goods and Technologies. It is Human Rights Watch's understanding that since that time no significant changes have been agreed in parliamentary debate and that this version is therefore substantively up-to-date as of June 2002. The legislation ultimately passed by the Bulgarian parliament, however, may differ in some respects. International Obligations and Commitments The legislation gives greater emphasis and weight to Bulgaria's international obligations and commitments. Most of the relevant provisions are not explicitly incorporated and made legally binding, as called for by Human Rights Watch. Nevertheless, their inclusion in the law represents a greater recognition of the importance of international standards and provides a tool to those who would press for better compliance with agreed norms. The legislation encourages that restrictions be put in place where the U.N. Security Council has imposed an arms embargo or where restrictions arise from Bulgaria's international commitments. With respect to U.N. embargoes, this provision enables the Bulgarian government to enact decrees to elaborate more precisely the manner in which the measures are to be implemented, thereby supplementing existing law on the implementation of U.N. sanctions. The international commitments that may be the basis for further restrictions under the legislation are those that ensue from the following: international conventions; the country's membership in international organizations (including export-control regimes); its accession to E.U. acts, joint acts, or common positions; or its accession to decisions of international organizations and export controls regimes of which Bulgaria is not a full member. Bulgarian officials familiar with the proposal told Human Rights Watch that this provision, while worded in general terms, is meant to include the E.U. Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which Bulgaria pledged to follow in 1998, as well as the November 2000 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) agreement on small arms and light weapons.2 Those measures, and the minimum export criteria elaborated therein, are not made binding under this provision. Instead, the legislation provides the basis for the government to enact a decree barring or limiting arms transfers to particular destinations on the basis of those measures, should it choose to do so. A further change in the same vein asserts the right of the government to introduce unilateral bans on arms transfers to """"a country on the territory of which military action is taking place, or that is involved in a military conflict."""" According to officials, this provision will permit the Bulgarian government to respond to international events as they arise, and take action if it feels that is required, rather than await a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing a new embargo. The inclusion of this provision appears to signal a greater consensus within the Bulgarian government that the country should be more proactive in blocking arms transfers that could fuel violent conflict. It offers the hope that Bulgaria will implement this and other agreed criteria more fully than it has in the past. The key will be actual practice. A welcome change is the inclusion of a new requirement for the government to prepare, make public, and periodically update a list of recipients subject to arms export restrictions. Brokering Controls A key provision of the legislation establishes legal controls on arms brokers, who under existing Bulgarian law are not subject to any regulation. Once enacted, the new controls will apply to arms deals carried out in Bulgaria, as well as transactions carried out by Bulgarian brokers outside the country. The inclusion of a provision giving the law extraterritorial reach demonstrates the development of international """"best practice"""" in this field. While some countries have adopted brokering provisions, many have thus far neglected to take up the issue or have done so though half-measures only. The previous Bulgarian government declined to include an extraterritoriality provision in its brokering proposals when this was suggested by Human Rights Watch in 1999. The legislation now before Bulgaria's parliament defines arms brokering (""""intermediary activity"""") as involvement in trade activities and includes """"all such activities involving preparation and implementation of a foreign trade transaction, including forwarding and transportation services, [and] funding, when the person performing such activities is not the actual exporter, importer or re-exporter, [and] where these activities are related in some way with the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria or with use of means of telecommunications for communication and/or postal services of the Republic of Bulgaria."""" Brokers registering under the new regime will be subject to the licensing procedures that parallel those currently in place for arms trading companies. In the first stage an interdepartmental commission established by the Council of Ministers (Bulgaria's cabinet) is to review applications and grant brokering licenses. In the second stage, licensed brokers will be required to apply for permits for individual arms deals, to be issued by a second body, an interministerial committee based at the economy ministry. Under vetting procedures outlined in the legislation, persons found to be unreliable or not financially sound will be refused a brokering license. Checks may also be performed on documents submitted with requests for individual permits. The legislation, however, does not establish what documents must accompany a broker's application for a license or permit. Instead, these are to be set out in the implementing regulations, which remain to be drafted after adoption of the legislation. In a change that is to be applied to arms traders as well as brokers, the legislation calls for the permanent revocation of licenses if the arms supplied are found to have been re-exported to an unauthorized destination. The license is to be revoked regardless of whether the trader or broker knowingly engaged in deceit. This provision thus makes the trading and brokering agents ultimately responsible for ensuring that the weapons do not go astray. The legislation envisions that foreign arms brokers will be able to take part in Bulgaria's weapons trade. The version of the amendments introduced by the government did not elaborate how their activities would be controlled, but Human Rights Watch understands that the legislation has since been modified to make foreign arms brokers subject to the same licensing requirements as Bulgarian brokers. Under the brokering provision, Bulgarian-registered transport companies must be licensed as arms brokers and must seek permission to undertake arms transportation outside Bulgaria. The conditions for foreign transporters to carry arms, however, are not clearly established in the legislation. It stipulates only that transportation of arms through Bulgarian territory requires a permit, to be issued by the interministerial committee. This discrepancy may have been addressed, as above, with a revision to the legislation proposed by the government. End-user Controls The expected changes to Bulgarian arms trade controls help to clarify and strengthen requirements for the proof of the ultimate destination of weapons exports, in large measure incorporating into law improvements that already have been put in place in practice. For example, it clarifies that all export license applications must be accompanied by an EUC or equivalent document, and that the buyer must guarantee that it will not re-export or otherwise divert the weapons without authorization from Bulgarian authorities. The legislation also formalizes procedures to evaluate the authenticity of the documents provided and to allow for post-shipment physical inspections to ensure that the weapons have been delivered to the correct destination. Penalties Administrative fines under the 1995 law were very low, and the legislation submitted by the government would raise these to 500 to 50,000 levs (approximately $250 to $25,000) for non-criminal offenses. Property sanctions of up to double the value of the transaction remain in place. Criminal penalties are addressed in the penal code, and the legislation offers no indication that these are to be changed. Administrative Structure The legislation envisions maintaining the two-tiered licensing structure described above. The interdepartmental commission that issues trading licenses will be given responsibility for licensing brokers. The second-tier body, the interministerial committee that issues permits for individual deals, is to be given new responsibility over non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, including with respect to compliance with an international convention banning chemical weapons, and renamed accordingly. Moreover, each of the members of this committee, which is comprised of representatives from various ministries, will be empowered to veto a licensing decision provided adequate justification is offered. Under a further change, the commission is to submit an annual report on the implementation of the revised legislation to the Council of Ministers. An element of the previous government's proposal was to create an independent arms control body to oversee the arms trade, which Human Rights Watch supports. The change was not included in the proposal currently before parliament, but it has been raised in parliamentary debate. It remains unclear whether there is sufficient parliamentary support to amend the proposal to create such a body. Other Changes Dual-Use Controls: The legislation includes a number of measures to tighten controls on so-called dual-use goods, items such as explosives, chemicals, and technologies that have legitimate civilian applications but can also be used for a military purpose (including, most notably, to build weapons of mass destruction). The new legislation, for example, requires that the government adopt a list of dual-use items that will be subject to licensing and transport controls matching those applicable on conventional weapons, including with respect to brokering activities. Foreign Ownership: The amendments lift a provision of the 1995 law that required that arms companies be at least 50 percent Bulgarian-owned. Government officials noted that the move to permit greater foreign investment in the sector is in keeping with a recommendation included in a 2001 report on the Bulgarian defense industry by the U.S. Atlantic Council, which sought to encourage the transformation of the industry toward markets in NATO countries. Extension of Licenses: In a move designed to permit arms companies to sign long-term contracts, the government intends to allow trading and brokering licenses to be issued for an initial period of one year, and to be renewed for three-year periods thereafter. The permits for individual deals would be issued for an initial period of six months and would be eligible for a one-time extension of a further six-months. Both licenses and permits would be subject to revocation on decision of the relevant authorizing bodies. Needed Reforms Not Included in the Legislation Transparency and Oversight The legislation offers little in terms of increased transparency. The requirement that most information about arms transactions be considered a commercial and state secret remains in place. In addition, there are no plans to publish the list of authorized arms trading companies or brokers. While a number of other countries publish an annual report describing (to different levels of specificity) their exports of weapons, to date Bulgaria has not done so. A modest provision related to transparency calls for the publication of the list of recipients subject to export restrictions. The list issued in April 2001, which government officials say satisfies this pending requirement, lists only recipients subject to regional or international sanctions about which information is publicly available. The list does not include a number of countries subject to restrictions under voluntary multilateral measures, such as the Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls on Conventional Arms and Dual-use Goods and Technologies. Moreover, the legislation does not provide an adequate mechanism for increased parliamentary oversight. The two bodies overseeing the arms trade report to the cabinet alone. Human Rights Watch understands that under an amendment introduced during parliamentary debate the Council of Ministers is to share with parliament the annual report on implementation of the arms trade legislation mandated under the legislation but need not make it public. Surplus The amendments due to be passed by parliament do not establish rules to specifically address the trade in surplus weapons (currently covered under the provisions governing the foreign trade in arms), although some amendments tailored to the surplus weapons problem are warranted. For example, existing law does not adequately reflect Bulgaria's commitments under the OSCE small arms agreement. The agreement states: """"The participating States agree that the preferred method for the disposal of small arms is destruction...Any small arms identified as surplus to national requirements should, by preference, be destroyed. However, if their disposal is to be effected by export...such export will only take place in accordance with the export criteria set out [in this document].""""3 Bulgarian practice, contrary to this agreement, has been to export surplus weapons where possible. A defense ministry official confirmed to Human Rights Watch that unless and until foreign funding becomes available to the government to meet the costs of destroying decommissioned weapons, the weapons will continue to be available for export. In October 2001, for example, the defense ministry announced its intention to sell off nearly 200 surplus tanks and other heavy weapons to finance procurement of NATO standard equipment. Conflicts of Interest Bulgarian law does not bar officials with responsibility for overseeing arms licensing decisions from simultaneously serving on the boards of arms companies. The legislation awaiting passage does not address the issue in any way. Human Rights Watch had recommended that formal action be taken after finding evidence of conflicts of interest in 1999. The then government said it would eliminate the practice, but at no point did it enact rules to prevent the problem from being repeated. To the contrary, the problem has apparently resurfaced. Until recently Bulgaria's foreign minister served on the board of a major arms manufacturing company. This came to public attention because the company's arms trading license was revoked in the wake of allegations of illegal arms transfers (see below). Recent Cases Show Better Implementation, Need for Stronger Enforcement Since beginning to more strictly monitor arms transfers, Bulgarian authorities have had some success detecting suspected illegal transactions and have responded more forcefully to allegations of illicit activity. These steps are to be commended and are an indication that controls are better implemented than they were in the past. Enforcement actions to date, however, fall short of what is needed. The government has yet to clearly demonstrate a strong commitment to carry out thorough investigations in all cases and to pursue criminal prosecutions where warranted. As of 1999, Bulgaria had not had any criminal prosecutions for illicit arms exports. Three years later, the same remains true. In April 2001 authorities detained a Ukrainian plane loaded with Czech weapons after becoming suspicious that the cargo might be headed to Eritrea, which was then under U.N. embargo. Following an investigation in which the Czech government asserted that the deal was perfectly legal, the plane and cargo were eventually released for delivery to Georgia, the declared destination. Little information was released about the basis for the decision to release the plane, however, and important questions remain about reported discrepancies in the cargo and the declarations of the crew. In a further example, in early 2002 Bulgarian authorities sought to block a plane registered in Equatorial Guinea from operating in Bulgaria on the basis of suspicions that the plane was linked to the arms-trafficking network of an air cargo operator repeatedly implicated in U.N. reports on embargo violations, including with respect to arms shipments from Bulgaria. Bulgarian authorities reportedly were investigating whether the plane may previously have operated under a fraudulent Bulgarian registration. Again, this is a positive sign. However, it remains unclear if the investigation into the operations of air cargo companies continues, and where such investigations might lead. With respect to alleged illegal arms exports by Bulgarian companies, the government has acted by revoking licenses but has not initiated criminal procedures to date. One such case arose in May 2002, when a major arms company was alleged to have been involved in illegal weapons deals with the government of Sudan, which is subject to an E.U. embargo that Bulgaria has pledged to follow, and that became law under the April 2001 decree incorporating such restrictions into law. A criminal investigation is underway. Conclusion  The expected adoption of legislative changes governing Bulgaria's arms trade marks a major step forward in the ongoing process of reforming the trade. Full reform lies requires Bulgaria to act on three fronts: to establish a strong legal framework, to implement controls strictly, and to enforce them rigorously. The legislation that awaits passage in parliament, while falling short in some areas, reflects important progress in others. Most significant is a provision that for the first time establishes controls on arms brokers. Key challenges lie ahead to ensure vigorous attention to the implementation and enforcement of the law. The proof of reform lies in the extent to which strict policies are in place and are matched by equally strict practices. The Bulgarian government, its citizens, and the country's international partners must all remain vigilant to ensure that Bulgaria stays on the path to reform and redoubles its efforts to end illicit and irresponsible arms trading once and for all. 1 Those who have worked to promote positive change in Bulgaria have long sought to use the leverage afforded by Bulgaria's NATO and E.U. aspirations. For example, in 1999 Human Rights Watch issued a report strongly condemning Bulgaria's anything-goes arms trade practices, and it has repeatedly called on NATO and E.U. member states to take steps to encourage needed reforms in Bulgaria and other candidate countries. (See, for example, Human Rights Watch, Bulgaria: Money Talks-Arms Dealing with Human Rights Abusers, April 1999; Human Rights Watch, Open Letter to E.U. Foreign Ministers on Security Concerns Raised by Arms Transfers from Candidate Countries, October 19, 2001; and Human Rights Watch, Open Letter to NATO Foreign Ministers on Promoting Responsible Arms Trade Practices, all available at www.hrw.org/arms. 2 Under the E.U. Code, governments agree to certain basic standards, including to not supply arms to human rights abusers, areas of violent conflict, or clients who might divert or re-export them to unauthorized destinations.

The Slovak parliament is expected to vote this week on amendments to tighten legal controls on the foreign trade in weapons. The Slovak government submitted the amendments to parliament in April. If parliament does not act on them before adjourning for summer recess in early July, adoption of reforms will be postponed until after national elections scheduled for September.  """"The proposed law has its strengths,"""" said Stephen Goose, acting executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch, """"but it would still leave the door wide open for illicit arms traffickers.""""  If adopted without changes, the new law would keep in place a provision allowing weapons shipments to transit through the country for up to seven days without a government license.  """"The transit loophole makes it all too easy for weapons to move through Slovakia undetected,"""" said Goose. """"It comes as no surprise that Bratislava airport has long been a hub for weapons deliveries to human rights abusers and areas of violent conflict.""""  Despite the fact that all flights landing and departing from Slovakia are subject to civil aviation and customs regulations, practice has shown that false or misleading documents can be used to conceal the true nature and destination of arms flights.  The legislation includes new controls on arms brokers, who would be required to seek government authorization to take part in the trade and also to request licenses for each individual deal they help arrange.  Under the provision, only Slovakia-based companies and individuals would be eligible to act as authorized brokers. The brokering controls are intended to apply equally to the activities of Slovak brokers both inside and outside Slovakia. Transport agents such as air cargo companies, however, would not be covered.  """"Unscrupulous arms brokers take advantage of any opportunity to bypass arms trade rules,"""" said Goose. """"This is a good first step to help rein them in.""""  An October 2001 United Nations report found that an international network of arms traffickers supplied weapons shipped from Slovakia to Liberia, in violation of a U.N. embargo. The case led to the arrest in late 2001 of a Slovak arms broker and passage of emergency legislation to close a legal loophole that exempted arms repair contracts from any licensing requirement.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the legislation now awaiting passage does not enhance transparency in the arms trade or parliamentary oversight. It also does not strengthen penalties for arms trade violations. The organization emphasized that further efforts were needed in Slovakia to improve enforcement of these laws.  """"The Slovak government has made important strides in tightening controls over the past year,"""" Goose said, """"but the process of bringing Slovakia's arms trade under full control is only beginning.""""  Human Rights Watch recently investigated Slovakia's arms trade and is preparing a report based on its findings.  Human Rights Watch summarized the key provisions of the legislation proposed by the Slovak government. Among its strengths, the legislation  introduces controls on arms brokers;  gives greater emphasis to compliance with international commitments;  clarifies existing licensing procedures;  improves regulatory controls designed to prevent diversion of weapons shipments to unauthorized destinations; grants customs authorities greater power to inspect, detain, or send back suspicious shipments. The main weaknesses identified by Human Rights Watch were that the proposed legislation  leaves in place an exemption for arms transit of seven days or less; does not regulate the activities of transport companies and shipping agents; fails to increase penalties;  does not enhance transparency over the arms trade, nor parliamentary oversight.","Europe/Central Asia, Czech Republic","Arms"

The veto was followed by an agreement on Sunday night to extend the mission until July 3, so that the United Nations Security Council could continue seeking a solution.    """"By threatening to end peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and holding the people of Sarajevo and Srebrenica hostage, the U.S. has stooped to a new low in its efforts to undermine the court and the rule of law,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's international justice program. """"Security Council members need to continue to stand their ground in the face of such bullying and pressure.""""     The treaty establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC) comes into force today, July 1, 2002. As of now, acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes could come under the authority of the ICC. Human Rights Watch hailed the new court as the biggest step forward in human rights in fifty years. In May, the Bush administration repudiated the U.S. signature on the ICC treaty, and has been conducting a campaign to undermine the court in its bilateral relations with many countries around the world.     Human Rights Watch said members of the Security Council must hold firm in the coming 72 hours to prevent the United States from winning an exemption for U.N. peacekeepers from the jurisdiction of the new war crimes court.     Dicker said yesterday's votes at the Security Council show that the United States is isolated in its efforts to undermine the new court. Dicker praised the thirteen members of the Security Council who withstood intense U.S. pressure to vote for a resolution exempting U.N. peacekeepers from the jurisdiction of the court.     """"The Security Council did the right thing by refusing to be stampeded,"""" said Dicker. """"But this drama isn't over yet. Council members have to find a way to reject Washington's assault on the court, while not sacrificing the interests of the people of Bosnia -- who have experienced genocide firsthand.""""     Dicker also urged Washington to use this temporary reprieve as an opportunity to rethink its misguided efforts to undermine international justice.     The resolution sought by Washington grants immunity from arrest, detention and prosecution for peacekeepers not only in the state that hosts a peacekeeping operation, but also in every other U.N. member state. It effectively amends the ICC treaty by carving out an exception to the ICC's jurisdiction and altering the obligations of seventy-four states that have ratified the ICC treaty and brought their domestic laws in line with the treaty's provisions.     Human Rights Watch said the ICC Treaty's entry into force showed the tide against impunity could not be stopped.     Either the state on whose territory the crimes occurred or the state of nationality of the accused must have ratified the ICC treaty for the court to be able to act. So far 74 states have ratified the treaty. The judges and prosecutor will be elected early in 2003.     """"Human Rights Watch considers this court to be a real victory for justice, for the future victims of these crimes, and for the many, many governments whose support is making this court possible,"""" Dicker said.     The ICC treaty also makes history in defining certain abuses of women's rights as major crimes. The court will seek accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity perpetrated against women, including rape, sexual slavery, enforced prostitution, forced pregnancy, enforced sterilization, and other forms of grave sexual violence.     """"Before, when national courts failed to do justice, those responsible for mass atrocities literally got away with murder,"""" said Dicker.

""""Montesinos has been tried and sentenced for undermining democracy,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"We also expect him to pay the price for the grave human rights violations he was responsible for.""""  In addition to sentencing Montesinos to imprisonment, Judge Saúl Peña of the anti-corruption court ordered him to pay the State about $2.8 million (10 million soles) in damages and disqualified him from practicing as an attorney for two years.  Montesinos, a close advisor to then President Alberto Fujimori, took over the National Intelligence Service (SIN) early in 1990 as its de facto head. Using the SIN as his tool, he engineered changes in the armed forces, the judiciary, and the legislature to bolster Fujimori's two-decade rule in Peru.  Montesinos also organized the Colina Group, a death squad that carried out two massacres in the early 1990s and harassed and intimidated Fujimori's political opponents for years.  Montesinos now faces charges of murder and other crimes attributed to the death squad.

Augusto Pinochet was regrettable even though widely expected, Human Rights Watch said today. In a ruling made public this afternoon, the court held that the former dictator was too ill to undergo trial for grave human rights crimes, upholding an appeals court ruling issued a year ago. Relatives of thousands of victims of Pinochet's rule will be deeply disappointed by this verdict, and the medical and legal grounds for the decision will continue to be disputed,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Even so, Pinochet's arrest in London in 1998 and his subsequent prosecution in Chile -- where he had enjoyed untrammeled power for two decades -- were historic events marking new possibilities for international justice.""""     The five judges of the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court ruled by four votes to one that the case against Pinochet should be permanently closed because of his allegedly ailing mental health. The appeals court had ruled that it be only temporarily suspended.     Only days ago, the Supreme Court unanimously authorized the appeals court to consider proceedings to remove Pinochet's parliamentary immunity, with a view to his prosecution for the 1974 murder in Buenos Aires of former army commander Gen. Carlos Prats. An Argentine judge has repeatedly requested the Chilean judiciary to open the proceedings so that Pinochet could be extradited to Argentina to stand trial for that crime. The key question now is whether lawyers for the Prats family will find legal arguments to surmount the obstacle presented by today's decision.     Chile's code of criminal procedure stipulates that defendants must be suffering from """"madness"""" (locura) or """"dementia"""" (demencia) before trial proceedings may be suspended for mental health reasons. On the basis of medical tests performed on Pinochet in January 2001, a team of independent experts concluded that he was suffering from """"moderate dementia."""" The Supreme Court, disagreeing with many legal experts, held that this level of mental disability was sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the code of criminal procedure.     The appeals court had suspended the prosecution based on a provision in Chile's new criminal procedure code that allows judges to suspend trials if the due process rights of the defendant cannot be guaranteed. The Supreme Court disagreed with this ruling, reasoning that the law had not yet entered into force in Santiago. All references to the new code were struck from the final verdict.     Pinochet's 1998 arrest in London helped to establish the principle that grave human rights crimes are subject to universal jurisdiction and can be prosecuted anywhere in the world. Two rulings by the House of Lords found that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution even though he was head of state at the time the crimes were committed. He was allowed to return to Chile in early 2000, ostensibly on health grounds.     Pinochet had faced prosecution for covering up fifty-seven extrajudicial executions and eighteen kidnappings carried out by members of the """"Caravan of Death,"""" a helicopter-borne military squad that executed and """"disappeared"""" seventy-five political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

The US is doing everything it can to undermine the new International Criminal Court. Unless Europe acts decisively, the cause of international justice will be imperiled. The US is doing everything it can to undermine the new International Criminal Court. Unless Europe acts decisively, the cause of international justice will be imperiled. The current battleground is at the United Nations. The Bush administration is pressing to exempt UN peacekeepers  from the reach of the court. By undermining the court's universality, the exemption would severely damage its credibility. The move is the latest manifestation of the view in Washington that international justice is only for others, not for Americans. Yet behind this breathtaking arrogance, the US administration is trying to determine how far it can push its allies. It knows that the European Union has adopted a legally binding common position to defend the letter and spirit of the court's treaty. But it hopes that bluster and threats will force European governments to back down. It is time to draw a line. If Europe forsakes this matter of principle, it will only embolden America's radical right in its belief that the US is above international law. Its demands will only intensify. The ICC, a permanent tribunal with potentially global reach, is available to prosecute anyone who commits genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Seventy-four governments, including the entire EU, have ratified its treaty. The US has long feared that Americans might face frivolous or politically motivated prosecutions. In response, many safeguards were placed in the court's treaty. Furthermore, any government can prevent the court from taking a case by investigating and, if appropriate, prosecuting its own alleged war criminals. In short, the rules for a fair tribunal are in place. The task now is to ensure that they are conscientiously applied. That will depend on the quality of the judges and prosecutor, and the culture of the court. Europe will have a key role to play in ensuring that the court adheres to the highest standards of justice. So might have the US. Even without ratifying the court's treaty, Washington could have offered advice on rules, personnel, procedures and prosecutions. But the Bush administration has chosen not to do so. And now, as the court is activated, it has upped the ante. It is threatening to withdraw from UN peacekeeping unless the UN Security Council exempts all peacekeepers from the court's reach. The threat is less dire than it appears at first blush because US participation in UN peacekeeping is so small. As of April 30, the US had only 35 troops and 677 police under the UN flag. Even if Washington were to withhold America's 27 per cent contribution to the peacekeeping budget, Europe would be better off making up the funds than sacrificing the promise of international justice. Washington's share of the budget for the UN mission in Bosnia, for example, comes to only €38m (£24.6m). Washington would be very short-sighted to continue to undermine peacekeeping in Bosnia or elsewhere when it depends on peacekeeping help in Afghanistan. Its bluff can be called. Washington says it would never deploy US troops where they would be subject to an international tribunal. But for the past seven years, US troops in Bosnia and Kosovo have been subject to the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal. So were US bombers over Bosnia in 1995 and Serbia and Kosovo in 1999. The crisis over the International Criminal Court is a manufactured one. The administration also accuses European governments of hypocrisy because in Afghanistan they entered into a standard peacekeeping agreement governing troops charged with criminal activity. The agreement requires Afghanistan to send these troops back to their home country for prosecution, not to an international tribunal. But that requirement is consistent with the ICC's preference for national prosecution. It does not negate the court's power to scrutinise domestic prosecutions and to seize control if they are a sham. The real reason behind Washington's blackmail is the most troubling. An increasingly influential faction in the Bush administration believes that US military and economic power is so dominant that the US is no longer served by international law. Better to negotiate issues case-by-case from a position of strength, they contend, than to be bound by international law in ways that might prove inconvenient. This attitude can be seen in the US rejection of not only the ICC but also treaties ranging from climate control to small arms. No effective global system can rest solely on coercion. Global order depends on most governments abiding voluntarily by shared norms. Exempting America from the rule of law undermines those norms, leaving a more violent and inhumane world. Europe must stand up to this superpower folly.","United States, Global",""

The growing insecurity threatens the continued delivery of humanitarian aid and resettlement assistance.  The briefing paper documents recent cases of sexual violence, forcible recruitment, arbitrary detention, ill-treatment, and looting by armed groups in the northern part of Afghanistan. International humanitarian aid workers have been targeted in several of these attacks, and a number of international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are now reevaluating their operations in the north.  """"The increase in targeted violence stems directly from the security vacuum in the north,"""" said Vikram Parekh, a Human Rights Watch researcher covering Afghanistan. """"Now the attacks on aid workers threaten a vital lifeline for local civilians, especially the most vulnerable groups.""""  The recent spate of attacks on aid groups includes the gang-rape of an international staff member, the robberies of two NGO offices, and firing on NGO vehicles. The security vacuum is caused by the competing ambitions of General Abdul Rashid Dostum's Junbish forces and General Atta Mohammad's Jamiat troops, the latter backed by the Jamiat-controlled defense ministry in Kabul. The two factions have repeatedly fought over territory south of Mazar-e Sharif and narrowly averted an armed conflict in the city itself one month ago.  In the briefing paper, Human Rights Watch found a pattern of abuses associated with these forces:  Local commanders of both parties forcibly recruit young men into their forces and extort money from local families seeking to avoid conscription;  Internally displaced persons (IDP) camps near Mazar have been militarized. Human Rights Watch gathered reports of forced labor at Junbish-dominated Camp 65 and ongoing sexual violence in Jamiat-controlled Sakhi camp; and  Ethnic Pashtuns, a minority in the north, continue to flee targeted violence in the Junbish-controlled Shoor Darya Valley. Witnesses described rapes of women and boys, seizure of farmland, and demands for money by local commanders. """"The U.N. has repeatedly negotiated peace agreements between Junbish and Jamiat, but has had no means of enforcing compliance,"""" Parekh said. """"Expanding the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) is vital to the security of Afghan civilians and aid groups-nowhere more so than in the north.""""  More than 60 Afghan and international humanitarian aid groups called on the Security Council last week to expand ISAF, in a letter issued by their coordinating body.  In its briefing paper, Human Rights Watch urged the newly appointed transitional government in Kabul and regional authorities in the north to investigate attacks on NGOs and other civilians, to respect the civilian nature of IDP camps, and to prohibit forcible recruitment by local commanders.

Jefferson, Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It seems that in Afghanistan, female leaders who stand up to warlords are threatened, while the warlords themselves are given high-level government posts.""""

A letter to the editor in a weekly newspaper published by Jamiat-e Islami, Payman-e Muhajid (""""message of the holy warrior""""), had previously alleged that Dr. Samar told a Canadian newspaper that she did not believe in Sharia (Islamic law). The writer had demanded that she be given """"appropriate punishment,"""" and that the judicial authorities carry out an investigation. After Dr. Samar complained to President Karzai, the court dropped the charge on June 24, saying that it was not supported by sufficient evidence. But a deputy chief justice, Fazel Ahmad Manawi, was quoted by the BBC as saying, """"Maybe, if we get stronger evidence, we will reopen the case.""""  """"The use of a blasphemy charge against Samar - even if it was later dropped - is a troubling sign that the judiciary in Afghanistan might become an instrument of political repression,"""" said Jefferson. """"The charge can be reinstated, against Dr. Samar or anyone else, and be used to silence and intimidate. The government needs to explain how all of this happened, why it happened, and why it won't happen again.""""  Human Rights Watch said the blasphemy charge is connected to reports of threats during the loya jirga. During the loya jirga, Human Rights Watch documented how Dr. Samar and several other female delegates were targeted for intimidation on numerous occasions. The blasphemy allegation was repeatedly highlighted by warlords threatening Dr. Samar. Delegates aligned with the Jamiat-i Islami party, and other groups aligned with the former president, Burhanuddin Rabbani, demanded that she """"repent"""" for comments in the paper. Chief Justice Shinwari was widely reported in Afghan media as saying that Dr. Samar had made """"irresponsible statements"""" and that the Supreme Court of Afghanistan believes that she cannot hold an official position in government.

It also analyzes the British-initiated agreement for international troops in Afghanistan (the ISAF agreement), which U.S. diplomats have cited to justify Washington's own efforts to obtain exemption.     At a meeting of the Security Council on Tuesday, June 18, U.S. diplomats presented two alternative proposals to exempt peacekeepers: the first text would apply only to peacekeepers deployed in Bosnia, while the second proposal would exempt peacekeepers in all U.N.-authorized or -mandated operations.     """"The U.S. failed to win ironclad guarantees insulating itself from the court when the treaty was negotiated, and now Washington is trying to achieve its goal through other means,"""" said Roth.

A cette date, la Chambre des Mises en Accusation de la Cour d'Appel de Bruxelles, autrement composée, avait prononcé l'irrecevabilité des poursuites contre Yérodia au motif que ce dernier ne pouvait pas être trouvé sur le territoire belge au moment du dépôt des plaintes. Les arrêts d'aujourd'hui confirment malheureusement cette interprétation de la loi de 1993 et déclarent donc également irrecevables les plaintes portées contre les complices de Sharon et de Gbabgo. Cette interprétation va à l'encontre de la volonté du législateur, qui a expressément indiqué lors du vote unanime de la loi de 1993 que les juridictions belges seraient compétentes même dans les cas où l'auteur présumé de l'infraction n'était pas trouvé sur le territoire belge. Il est intéressant à noter que les trois arrêts ont été prononcés d'un avis contraire à celui de l'Avocat général représentant le Parquet à l'audience.  Force est de constater que depuis 1994 la doctrine juridique, les juges d'instruction, et le Gouvernement lui-même ont interprété la loi dans le sens exprimé par le législateur en 1993. C'est ainsi que le Gouvernement a, par exemple, adressé des demandes d'extradition à d'autres pays, et plaidé avec énergie en faveur de l'extradition, par la Tanzanie, d'un militaire rwandais soupçonné d'être impliqué dans l'assassinat des casques bleus belges de la MINUAR. Faut-il rappeler que dans l'affaire Pinochet le Gouvernement belge a joué un rôle important dans un effort commun avec l'Espagne, la France et la Suisse, pour empêcher que le général chilien puisse librement retourner au Chili. Plusieurs déclarations politiques ont été faites à cet égard, aussi bien dans la presse belge, qu'au Parlement. Or, si l'on applique à la lettre les décisions prises aujourd'hui, les plaintes auraient dû être déclarées irrecevables, Pinochet n'étant pas présent sur le territoire belge lors du dépôt de la plainte.  Ainsi, les trois arrêts, celui du 16 avril 2002 et ceux d'aujourd'hui, créent de toutes pièces une controverse, qui paralyse actuellement l'instruction des dossiers en cours basés sur la loi du 16 juin 1993.  Exiger que la personne poursuivie soit présente sur le territoire belge lors du dépôt des plaintes risque de rendre irrecevable la quasi-totalité des plaintes déposées en application de la loi de 1993 et donc vider celle-ci de sa substance et rendre son objectif vain. Si cette décision est appliquée strictement, une victime belge de crimes contre l'humanité perpétrés à l'étranger par un étranger ne pourra pas s'adresser aux tribunaux de son propre pays si l'auteur présumé n'est pas trouvé sur le territoire belge. L'application de ces arrêts interdit, par exemple, aux familles des casques bleus belges massacrés au Rwanda ou des prêtres belges assassinés au Guatemala de s'adresser aux tribunaux belges pour demander justice.  Au-delà de la paralysie de l'application de la loi de 1993, la controverse risque également de porter atteinte à l'image de la Belgique sur la scène internationale, soit l'image d'un pays progressiste et exemplaire sur le plan du droit pénal international. Depuis plusieurs années, la Belgique occupe une place importante sur cette scène, sa législation étant devenue une référence en matière de compétence universelle.  Cette controverse aurait évidemment pu être évitée si la volonté clairement exprimée par le législateur au cours de la discussion parlementaire avait été tout aussi clairement traduite dans le texte même de la loi. Il appartient au législateur de prendre sa responsabilité.  En conséquence, les signataires de ce communiqué réaffirment que la loi belge de compétence universelle constitue l'un des éléments essentiels de la lutte mondiale engagée contre l'impunité dont bénéficient les responsables d'atrocités massives et dans la construction nouvelle d'une justice universelle. Elle est essentielle pour combattre l'impunité qu'organisent eux-mêmes les tyrans et les tortionnaires dans leurs propres pays.  La loi doit s'appliquer pleinement, la condition de présence de la personne poursuivie sur le territoire belge ne pouvant pas être retenue comme condition de recevabilité des plaintes.  Les organisations précitées appellent le Parlement belge à rétablir d'urgence la portée exacte de la loi du 16 juin 1993, telle que le législateur de l'époque l'a conçue. Elles font appel aux parlementaires pour qu'ils adoptent le plus vite possible une loi interprétative de la loi du 16 juin 1993, précisant que l'auteur présumé ne doit pas être trouvé en Belgique, comme l'exposé des motifs de la loi de 1993 le mentionnait déjà.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Belgium, Israel/Palestine","International Justice"

Neither legal counsel nor relatives have reportedly been able to see Yuldash Rasulov, a member of the Kashkadaria branch of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), since several days after his arrest. According to local sources, there are credible indications that Rasulov may have been tortured while in custody. Torture is a widespread practice in police detention in Uzbekistan.  """"We are fearful for Rasulov,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Uzbekistan has a terrible record of torture, and people held in incommunicado detention have a much greater chance of being tortured-and dying from it.""""  On May 24, police arrested Rasulov in Karshi and brought him to Tashkent, where he is currently under investigation for """"religious extremism."""" Police claim that he was recruiting Islamic militants. The HRSU denies that he was involved in any """"extremist"""" activities. According to HRSU, Rasulov collected information about people whose religious practices and affiliations fall beyond the confines of state-sponsored Islam. He also is known to be a religious man who prays five times a day.  In the letter to President Karimov, Human Rights Watch expressed its concern that Uzbek authorities arrested Yuldash Rasulov in violation of his rights to freedom of belief, expression and association. In the June 21 letter, Human Rights Watch called on the Uzbek government to:  · immediately arrange Rasulov's access to legal counsel of his choice; and · in the absence of formal criminal charges, immediately release him from detention.  """"The Uzbek government continues to arrest and imprison people for their peaceful religious expression,"""" said Andersen. """"In this case it looks like they have targeted Rasulov for his defense of these people, or for his own peaceful religious expression.""""  In the letter to Karimov, Human Rights Watch said that it has have documented a pattern of government harassment of human rights activists in Uzbekistan and called on the government to fulfill its obligations under international law to respect the rights of human rights defenders.  Human Rights Watch has also documented the continuing government crackdown against independent Muslims. People who meet privately to pray or study Islam, who belong to Islamic groups not registered with the government, or who possess Islamic literature not generated by the government are arrested and detained for nothing more than their peaceful expression of their religious beliefs. Local human rights groups estimate that 7,000 independent Muslims are currently in prison in Uzbekistan.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","Religious Freedom"

Authorities should be protecting -- not punishing -- victims of trafficking,"""" said Sara Colm, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"While these young women are in prison, their suspected traffickers and the brothel owner are free, protected by a criminal justice system that blames the victim. The traffickers are the ones who should be put on trial and punished.""""  On June 20, police arrested the fourteen girls at the offices of a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that had been sheltering them. The girls are now being held in Correctional Center 2 (Prey Sar) prison on the outskirts of the capital. A warrant for their arrest, issued by the Phnom Penh Municipal Court on June 16, charged the girls with illegal entry into Cambodia under the immigration law. [While three of the girls were released on bail on June 24 until their trial, the judge has refused to drop the charges against any of the girls.]  The arrested girls were originally rescued during a police raid on a brothel on May 23 in a red-light district of Phnom Penh, where it is well known that young girls, including virgins, are offered for sex. Ironically it was police officers from the Minors Protection Section of the Anti-Trafficking Unit at the Ministry of Interior who conducted both the rescue operation and the subsequent arrests.  """"These arrests violate every principle regarding the appropriate treatment of apparent trafficking victims,"""" said Colm. """"They should be provided with medical and legal services, counseling, secure shelter, and given the opportunity to cooperate in the investigation into the traffickers. It is imperative that these girls get the services they need and deserve.""""  The investigating judge on the case told reporters that initial findings revealed that the girls were trafficking victims, but that when the court learned the girls had entered Cambodia without legal documentation, they were no longer considered victims, but violators of Cambodian law for illegal entry into the country.  Cambodian authorities also say that the girls are all more than eighteen years of age, but human rights observers present during yesterday's arrest as well as workers for the NGO that sheltered them said they are children, aged between twelve and eighteen.  """"Although victims of trafficking who are children often need more support and may have been targeted initially because of their vulnerability, their age is ultimately irrelevant. The point is that they are victims, not criminals,"""" said Colm.  The arrests came as Cambodia's donors were meeting in Phnom Penh to pledge billions of dollars in assistance for the next few years, based in part on evaluations of Cambodia's progress in making reforms. A recent report by the U.S. Department of State says Cambodia has one of the worst records on human trafficking.  """"Cambodia's donors have provided hundreds of thousands of dollars for programs to fight the sexual exploitation of children and human trafficking. The donors should raise strong concerns about these arrests with the government,"""" said Colm.  Under Cambodian law, the trafficking of human beings by any means for the purpose of sexual exploitation is a crime, regardless of whether the victim consents. Brothel owning and pimping are also crimes under the law subject to strong penalties, especially if the victims are children or are from a foreign country.","Asia, Cambodia","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

The Bakassi Boys have been responsible for numerous human rights abuses in the neighboring states of southeastern Nigeria where they operate, including extrajudicial killings, public burnings, mutilations, torture, and unlawful detentions. “The Bakassi Boys’ violent record and their complete disregard of the law are well-known,” said Carina Tertsakian, researcher at Human Rights Watch. “If they have killed and tortured with impunity in Anambra, Abia, and Imo states, why would they behave any differently in Ebonyi State – especially when they are being welcomed there by the governor himself?”  These abuses, as well as the deployment of the Bakassi Boys to target perceived political opponents of state governments, were documented in a detailed report published by Human Rights Watch (headquartered in New York) and CLEEN (headquartered in Lagos) on May 20, 2002, titled “The Bakassi Boys: The Legitimization of Murder and Torture.” Further killings by the Bakassi Boys have been reported in recent weeks, particularly in Anambra State: more than twenty people, including several women, were reportedly killed by the Bakassi Boys in Onitsha in the last week of May, and further killings were reported in Onitsha as recently as mid-June.  The two human rights organizations said that state governors have a responsibility to prevent, not encourage, the spread of vigilante violence. They appealed to Governor Sam Egwu to reconsider his decision and to resist public pressure to introduce the Bakassi Boys into Ebonyi.  “We recognize high levels of violent crime pose a serious problem in many parts of Nigeria,” said Innocent Chukwuma, Executive Director of CLEEN. “But the solution is not to continue resorting to extrajudicial means or to support vigilante violence.”  The two human rights groups also described as regrettable recent statements by Orji Uzor Kalu, the governor of Abia State – the state where the Bakassi Boys were first formed, and where they are still active. Speaking to journalists in early June 2002, Governor Kalu announced that he would defy any attempts to prevent the Bakassi Boys from operating in his state. The Vanguard newspaper of June 1 quoted him as saying: “No law can stop us from having the vigilante group in Abia. Even if the National Assembly passes the law, it is not going to work in Abia. I have the mandate of the people to govern this state and anybody posted here who does not cooperate with the people will be asked to get out.” Referring to a recent incident in which the Bakassi Boys had clashed with the police, he said: “We are not ready to tolerate any commissioner of police arresting any member of Bakassi as a robber.” On June 11, The Daily Champion newspaper quoted him as saying: “Any plan by the Federal Government to ban Bakassi under whatever guise would amount to undue interference.”  “Such statements amount to an explicit approval of the violent and arbitrary methods used by the Bakassi Boys under the pretext of ‘fighting crime,’” said Tertsakian. “If state governors want to show commitment to ensuring the security of the population, they should condemn these human rights abuses, disband the Bakassi Boys, and support the introduction of law enforcement mechanisms, which will genuinely protect people and bring criminals to justice, within the framework of the law.”  The two organizations also reiterated their appeal to the federal government to produce effective and long-lasting solutions to the dual problems of widespread crime and increasing vigilante violence. The HRW/CLEEN report published in May included a set of recommendations for national police reform that would ensure effective enforcement of law and order and protection and security for the population.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Many delegates representing civil society told Human Rights Watch that they had been excluded from any real decision-making. As the loya jirga nears its end, they expressed fears about the resurgent power of the warlords who were active, and at time abusive, participants in the loya jirga process.  """"Afghanistan's warlords are stronger today then they were ten days ago before the loya jirga started,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"Short term political expediency has clearly triumphed over human rights.""""  The cabinet just named by Hamid Karzai, head of the transitional government, differs only slightly from that of the interim administration. The predominantly Tajik Jamiat-e Islami party holds three key cabinet posts while the Shi'a Hazara party, Hizb-e Wahdat, gained a seat. Both parties have been implicated in the recent attacks on ethnic Pashtun civilians in northern Afghanistan following the collapse of the Taliban. Jamiat has also been involved in an ongoing conflict with General Abdul Rashid Dostum's Junbish party in northern Afghanistan, where the fighting and general insecurity has imperiled international humanitarian aid operations.  The appointment of Fazul Hadi Shinwari to the post of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court also raises serious human rights concerns. Shinwari was quoted in press interviews in January as saying that Shari'a punishments including stoning and amputation would be retained, albeit with stricter due process guarantees than under the Taliban. His position contradicted Karzai's assertion during a visit to the United States that same month that Shari'a punishments could only be imposed in a society in which social justice and freedom from hunger prevailed.  Karzai did not announce who would lead the Ministry for Women's Affairs. Given the history of discrimination that Afghan women have suffered and the continuing insecurity in the country, this ministry is key to promoting and achieving Afghan women's rights.  The framers of the Bonn agreement recognized that an interim administration for Afghanistan, established immediately after the collapse of the Taliban, would have to include warlords who had reestablished themselves as effective authorities in most of the country in the fight against the Taliban. However, the selection of the transitional government to lead Afghanistan during reconstruction, by the delegates of the emergency loya jirga was supposed to reflect the voice of civilians, not warlords.  """"Instead of creating the space for civilian leadership to emerge during the six-month interval, the lack of an internationally enforced security arrangement meant that warlords used that time to rebuild their military and political networks,"""" said Zia-Zarifi.  A delegate from Kabul told Human Rights Watch, """"Warlords who bombed Kabul are not supposed to be here in the loya jirga. People who are contaminated with the blood of Afghans should not be elected as ministers.""""  One group of delegates planned to submit a slate of candidates to fill the cabinet. None of the candidates on the lists were warlords or affiliated with them. Before the delegates had the opportunity to present their slate at the loya jirga, at least three members of the group received death threats over the phone.","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights"

""""War continues to rage in eastern Congo. Within that larger war, combatants carry out another war - sexual violence against women and girls,"""" said Alison Des Forges, senior advisor to the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.   The report, which is based on numerous interviews with victims, witnesses, and officials, details crimes of sexual violence committed by soldiers of the Rwandan army and its Congolese ally, the Rassemblement congolais pour la démocratie (RCD), as well as armed groups opposed to them - Congolese Mai Mai rebels, and Burundian and Rwandan armed groups.   These combatants raped women and girls during military operations to punish the local civilian population for allegedly supporting the """"enemy."""" In other cases, Mai Mai rebels and other armed groups abducted women and girls and forced them to provide sexual services and domestic labor, sometimes for periods of more than a year.   Some rapists attacked their victims with extraordinary brutality. In two cases, assailants inserted firearms into the vaginas of their victims and shot them. In other cases combatants mutilated the sexual organs of the women with knives or razor blades. Some attacked girls as young as five years of age and women as old as eighty.   Assailants often attacked women and girls engaged in the usual activities necessary to the livelihoods of their families: cultivating their fields, collecting firewood, or going to market. By doing so, the assailants further disrupted the already precarious economic life of the region.   Medical services in eastern Congo have nearly totally collapsed, leaving most victims of rape and other sexual torture with little hope for treatment of injuries or of sexually transmitted diseases, including testing and post-exposure treatment for HIV/AIDS. Some experts estimate that HIV prevalence among military forces in the region may be higher than 50 percent. Rape in these circumstances can be a death sentence.   The report also documents the rejection of some women and girls by their husbands, families, and wider communities because they were raped or because they are thought to be infected with HIV/AIDS. As one such ostracized woman told Human Rights Watch researchers, """"My body has become sad. I have no happiness.""""   With the collapse of official services, Congolese churches and civil society organizations have used their scarce resources to assist the victims. Local organizations which have also documented sexual violence in the region contributed to the report.   """"Commanders of regular military units and heads of armed groups alike must get their men in order,"""" said Des Forges. """"Combatants must direct their violence against recognized military targets, not against helpless women and girls who happen to cross their paths. Those who abuse women must be held accountable for their crimes.""""   Sexual Violence in Eastern Congo: Recent Testimonies   Below are excerpts of testimonies on sexual violence in the Congo war. All names have been changed to protect the identity of the victims and witnesses.   Delphine W., twenty-one years old, about her rape in September 2001 in Goma: I don't know what time it was, I was asleep. Four men, soldiers, came to see what they wanted to steal. They were armed with knives. They spoke Kinyarwanda and Kiswahili-the two languages of the military. Some were Rwandan and some Congolese. Some were in civilian clothing and some in military uniform. There was just me and my mother in the house. They forced the door open. I was in bed. When the door opened I cried out. They said they needed the girl. Three of the men raped me. They did not rape my mother. They said they didn't need the mother, just the girl. They asked if I was married and I said no. They asked me if I had ever been taken by a man and why. [One of the men] said, """"What girl has never been taken by men?"""" It was the first time I had ever slept with men. They said if I refused, they'd kill me. The first one who took me hit me with his hands; he took me by force. I asked for mercy. He said that if I didn't let him do it he would kill me. I refused. He hit me so I accepted. I was still in bed. The others didn't hit me. The second one wanted to put his thing in my mouth - I refused. The three raped me, the fourth left. When they took me, I felt sick. In the night I cried and said to God: """"Why did you want it to be like that? I refused so many men. Then I had to accept men I had never met before, I didn't even know their faces."""" My mother told me I should thank God I was still alive. She told me to be brave and not say anything to other families so as not to lose my reputation. She said if I talked about it, I might not get a husband. They could say I have illnesses because I was with soldiers. I was sick for three days. I felt cold. It felt as if they had put chili in me - it burned. There was lots of blood running out. In the morning my mother gave me water to wash with, just water. I haven't seen a doctor or a nurse.  A mother about the murder of her daughter Monique B., aged twenty, in Kabare: On May 15 of this year [2001], four heavily armed combatants - they were Hutu - came to our house at 9 p.m. Everyone in the neighborhood had fled. I wanted to hide my children, but I didn't have time. They took my husband and tied him to a pole in the house. My four-month-old baby started crying and I started breastfeeding him and then they left me alone. They went after my daughter, and I knew they would rape her. But she resisted and said she would rather die than have relations with them. They cut off her left breast and put it in her hand. They said, """"Are you still resisting us?"""" She said she would rather die than be with them. They cut off her genital labia and showed them to her. She said, """"Please kill me."""" They took a knife and put it to her neck and then made a long vertical incision down her chest and split her body open. She was crying but finally she died. She died with her breast in her hand. RCD officers came and looked at the body. But then they went away and I don't think they ever did anything about it. I didn't talk to other authorities because I thought it was a military matter. There is no electricity there, and we couldn't see much, but we could hear her scream and see what happened when we saw the body in the morning. I never saw the attackers again, but I couldn't even see them well that night. They didn't stay after they killed my daughter.  Sophie W., a mother in her thirties from Shabunda, about her abduction: We went into the forest at the beginning of the war. My husband thought the forest was safer, and there was nothing to eat in town. But we moved back to town in 2000. In July 2000 the Mai-Mai came and took my husband. They beat me up and shot him and then cut up his body in front of me. They said my husband was a spy for the Tutsi. There were eight Mai-Mai. Two of them held me down and the others raped me. They put two knives to my eyes and told me that if I cried, they would cut out my eyes. The Mai-Mai [took me back to the forest. They] spoke Kiswahili, Kilenga, Lingala, and Kinyarwanda. They were filthy - they had fleas. We had no shelter. There were only leaves to sleep on, and when it rained, we got soaked. We had mats with us, but the Mai-Mai took them away. There were many of them during the time I was in the forest - even 150 or more. They sometimes fed us small animals that they killed, but they didn't give us much food.  Eléonore R, twelve years old, on an attack by on her home in Goma in August 2001: Four [men] came into the house and there were more outside. They opened the door, took the papa, tied him up, hit the mama, and took everything in the house. They made a lot of noise. I hid under the bed. They then came to my room. One was very tall, the other fat. I didn't know them and didn't really see them. They had guns and flashlights. They spoke Kinyarwanda and Kiswahili. When I refused one hit me twice with his hand. Then he did the act. There were four other children in the room, all younger. The man who did it told the others to close their eyes. I also closed my eyes. They stopped when the blood came.  A forty year old woman farmer from Uvira on an attack in July 2001:  We were all working in the fields when some Banyamulenge men in uniforms and with arms surrounded us. We ran and hid but they grabbed a Burundian woman who was with us. They accused the woman of being the wife of the Mai-Mai. She said that she had come to seek refuge here. Seven soldiers took the Burundian woman off and raped her. Then they put a gun into her vagina and shot her. When they left we carried her with us. She died on the way [into town].  Générose N., from Kabare, aged twenty, about her abduction:  I was on the road from Kalonge to Mudaka. I had money that my fiancé gave me to buy a wedding dress. A soldier attacked me on the road. He said things in Kinyarwanda. [Later she said he was Hutu]. He took me away to a place in the forest where there were three other soldiers. They roughed me up. This was August 8 [2001] and they kept me until August 25 and each one of them raped me every day. There wasn't a house as such but a shelter under some plastic sheeting. I found out that they had another woman there before me and I was sleeping where she slept, and then later they would get another woman after me. I wore the same clothes all the time. If I tried to speak, they hit me. They were all the same - horrible men. They finally just sent me away when they were tired of me.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","Health, Women's Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Sexual Violence and Rape"

The United States has been almost alone internationally in failing to recognize the senseless cruelty of executing the mentally retarded,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of the U.S. Program at Human Rights Watch. """"Even supporters of the death penalty recognize that people with lifelong mental impairments do not belong on death row."""" The Supreme Court ruled in the case of Daryl Atkins, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 1996 robbery and murder of Eric Nesbitt. Atkins is reported to have an overall IQ of 59. An I.Q. below 70 is considered a major indicator of diminished intellectual functioning consistent with mental retardation. In a majority opinion written by Justice Stevens, the Court concluded that the practice of executing offenders with mental retardation """"has become unusual, and it is fair to say that a national consensus has developed against it. This consensus unquestionably reflects widespread judgment about the relative culpability of mentally retarded offenders, and the relationship between mental retardation and the penological purposes served by the death penalty."""" In 1989, when the court upheld the constitutionality of executing mentally retarded offenders, only two states prohibited such executions of those with mental retardation. The Supreme Court's 6-3 decision may spare hundreds from execution. There are 2,455 persons currently under death sentence in the twenty states whose laws permit the execution of the mental retarded; an estimated five percent may be mentally retarded. Over the past decade and a half, efforts to ban the execution of the mentally retarded have led to legislation in eighteen states and the federal government prohibiting such executions. Another twelve states do not permit capital punishment in any circumstances. There are 3,701 persons currently on death row across the United States. Human Rights Watch, which opposes capital punishment in all cases as inherently cruel and a violation of fundamental human dignity, said the death penalty is particularly unconscionable for offenders whose cognitive development has been limited by mental retardation. Human Rights Watch's 2001 report, """"Beyond Reason: The Death Penalty and Offenders with Mental Retardation,"""" described how the mentally retarded have lifelong limited abilities to reason, think, learn from experience and understand causality. """"Although they can commit terrible crimes, by virtue of their disability, they should never be considered among the most culpable offenders for whom, in the United States, the death penalty is ostensibly reserved,"""" said Fellner. Those with mental retardation are also particularly at risk of a miscarriage of justice in their capital prosecutions. As documented in Beyond Reason, their disability makes it hard for them to comprehend abstract legal concepts and their unreliable memories and suggestibility impede their ability to assist in their defense. Being characteristically eager to please authority, many detainees with mental retardation waive their rights to remain silent and even make false confessions. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights has urged countries that retain the death penalty to refrain from imposing it on people with mental retardation. On April 25, 2002, the Commission issued a resolution, urging those states that have capital punishment not to impose it on persons suffering from any kind of """"mental disorder,"""" which includes mental retardation. In 1998, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions criticized the United States for executing the mentally retarded in contravention of international standards and in violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

Human Rights Watch also urged Karzai to direct the newly formed Afghan Human Rights Commission and provide it with the necessary resources, to hear complaints about intimidation, monitor delegates as they return to their areas of origin, and recommend steps towards accountability.   Human Rights Watch has documented and reported numerous instances of threats and intimidation by specific warlords and their supporters, many connected to the loya jirga process. On June 17, Karzai invited loya jirga delegates to report cases of intimidation directly to him. This invitation acknowledged that delegates participating in the loya jirga have been threatened and intimidated both before and during the assembly.  """"President Karzai has shown that he is serious about addressing intimidation by warlords,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"Strong measures are now needed. To break this dangerous trend, investigations must be launched immediately into cases of intimidation."""" Zia-Zarifi also noted that those coming forward to complain of intimidation would need guarantees of confidentiality and protection.  By initiating such investigations, the transitional government would be acting consistently with the letter and spirit of the Bonn Agreement and the rules and procedures of the loya jirga, both of which aim to increase the authority of legitimate representatives of Afghan civil society and decrease the power of warlords.  Human Rights Watch is especially concerned about the safety of the hundreds of delegates who courageously withstood the intimidation of the warlords but will soon return to villages, towns and cities across Afghanistan where warlords continue to wield power.  Many delegates spoke to Human Rights Watch about their fear of returning to districts where the specter of violence looms large. One woman told Human Rights Watch that the security measures in Kabul gave her the courage to be outspoken, but she now fears returning to her city of origin. Other delegates who were vocal in their criticisms of regional commanders shared similar sentiments.  Human Rights Watch also urged President Karzai to create human rights reporting and monitoring mechanisms that are accessible to all Afghans. The new Afghan government should deploy mechanisms envisioned in the Bonn Agreement, such as the newly established Human Rights Commission and the planned Civil Service Commission, to build a system of accountability for those involved in serious violations of human rights. International assistance and sustained commitment to these efforts are needed.  """"Afghanistan cannot do this alone,"""" said Zia-Zarifi. """"President Karzai has repeatedly called for a greater security presence. It is past time for the international community to heed this call by acting now to improve security conditions throughout Afghanistan.""""  Human Rights Watch said that the incoming transitional government would need much time and resources to train and deploy a national police force. In the meantime, an expanded international security force is the only way to ensure peace in Afghanistan","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights"

Its economy is being drained by a bloated military. Investment is deterred by a weak legal system and a corrupt judiciary. The World Bank, in a carefully understated analysis, says the country and its population of 12 million face a """"formidable array of development challenges."""" When Cambodia's foreign aid donors meet in Phnom Penh from this Wednesday to Friday, they should find a way to jump-start the reforms that are urgently needed. Poverty reduction and good governance will be the theme of the meeting of what is known officially as the Cambodia Consultative Group. If it is anything like past meetings, little will result but vague promises from the Cambodian government in response to weak demands by the donors for reform. On Feb. 3, Cambodia held its first local, commune-level elections in more than 30 years. The pre-election period was marked by hundreds of complaints of intimidation, harassment and death threats. From January 2001 to polling day, 15 members of political parties running against the governing Cambodian People's Party were murdered. There was widespread coercion of voters, primarily through confiscation of voter registration cards and pressure to take oaths of loyalty to the ruling party. It won control of most commune councils. Yet the donors and many Cambodians recognized this experiment with grassroots democracy as an improvement over national elections in 1993 and 1998 plagued by rampant political violence, in part a legacy of years of civil war, Vietnamese occupation and fighting against remnants of the Khmer Rouge regime. The more important test will be the National Assembly elections scheduled for July next year. The donors should develop a set of minimal benchmarks for electoral reform, and condition any aid or tech-nical assistance for the polls on the government's strict adherence. There must be a comprehensive reorganization of the National Election Committee, the body charged with supervising the election process, to make it truly impartial. A good first step was the public hearing held recently by the National Assembly on amendments to the electoral law. The election committee is due to start work in September. The security of all candidates and their supporters must be guaranteed, and all parties should be given full and equal access to the broadcast media. Procedures for the committee to investigate and penalize electoral abuses should be strengthened. Violations committed in campaigning for the February elections should be prosecuted and punished. Donors should also take steps to put teeth into well-intentioned but largely ineffectual efforts to promote good governance. As the World Bank has pointed out, sustainable development cannot take place without a credible legal and judicial system, an end to corruption and civil service reform. The Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee, a coalition of 18 Cambodian nongovernment organizations, is calling on the donors to take much more stringent action to monitor the government's commitments to strengthen the rule of law. Promises by Prime Minister Hun Sen and his cabinet have yet to bring about improvements needed in the criminal procedure code and the penal code. Nongovernmental organizations are urging the donors to press for a comprehensive judicial reform plan and greater transparency in the operation of the legal system. Also on the agenda for the donors' meeting is Cambodia's $42 million Demobilization and Reintegration Project,' a plan aimed at downsizing the military, disarming soldiers (who are notorious for abusing civilians with impunity) and cutting the defense budget. But the project, funded partly by the World Bank and Japan, is based on wildly divergent estimates of the size of the armed forces, allegations that thousands of """"ghost soldiers"""" who don't exist are collecting compensation packages, and other charges of corruption and incompetence. The World Bank and the donors should cancel the project, or revamp it from top to bottom, with assistance from nongovernmental organizations and scrutiny from outside auditors. The Cambodian government has signed and ratified international human rights treaties. It should be praised for being the first Southeast Asian country to ratify the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court. But donors should not remain silent about Cambodia's recent decision to close its borders and deport hundreds of asylum seekers from Vietnam, contrary to its obligations under international refugee law. Cambodia is facing donor fatigue amid competing demands for aid to Afghanistan and Africa. What it needs most is a transfusion of political will as well as funding to tackle deep-seated problems created by years of inertia and conflict.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/06/18/letter-secretary-powell-regarding-us-state-departments-trafficking-report","Letter to Secretary Powell regarding the US State Departments Trafficking Report","Letter to Secretary Powell regarding the U.S. State Department's Trafficking Report","","06/18/2002","The Honorable Colin Powell  Secretary of State U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street, N.W., 7th Floor Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Secretary Powell:   We write to congratulate the U.S. State Department on the release of its second annual Trafficking in Persons Report (Trafficking Report) and to share some of our concerns about its content. Human Rights Watch considers the Trafficking Report a potentially powerful tool to address trafficking worldwide. However, several shortcomings undermine its impact.   As you are well aware, trafficking is a widespread human rights violation that threatens the lives, health, dignity, and security of millions of people throughout the world, with women and children suffering the brunt of the abuses. Trafficking is almost universally condemned, yet despite the formal commitment of many governments to combat the problem, many countries have taken insufficient measures to ensure the greatest protection for the human rights of trafficking victims.   Human Rights Watch has for many years documented and monitored trafficking in persons and advocated for greater accountability of traffickers. We have investigated trafficking of women and girls from Bangladesh to Pakistan, from Burma to Thailand, from Nepal to India, from Thailand to Japan, and from Eastern Europe to Bosnia and Herzegovina.   Based on our experience, we would like to raise the following concerns with the Trafficking Report that we hope will be corrected next year:  The Trafficking Report does not adequately evaluate anti-trafficking measures. The Trafficking Report cites """"actions"""" taken by governments to combat trafficking, such as setting up victim service programs, establishing inter-ministerial working groups, and proposing draft legislation, but does not evaluate the content or effectiveness of such measures. For example, the chapter on Costa Rica notes that minimal legal services are provided to victims, but does not assess the quality of the services or point out that foreign trafficking victims are deported without the benefit of those services. The chapter on Pakistan reports that the government established an inter-agency task force to combat trafficking in persons, but does not evaluate the results of the task force's work. The chapter on Nigeria mentions its draft federal trafficking legislation, but does not evaluate its shortcomings, such as the weak provisions on witness protection and victim services. Mentioning such measures without evaluating them gives credit where it may not be due. The Trafficking Report should set forth qualitative information: Are the victim service programs appropriately designed and funded, and are they effectively assisting victims in practice? What are the inter-ministerial task forces mandated to do, and have they succeeded? Does draft legislation cover trafficking into all forms of forced labor and provide adequate victim services and witness protections?  The Trafficking Report is almost devoid of statistics. Crucial statistical data are almost entirely missing from the Trafficking Report. Two notable exceptions are the Albania and Moldova chapters, which provide basic data on the numbers of trafficking arrests, prosecutions, and convictions. In order to understand the scope and nature of the trafficking problems in the countries covered by the Trafficking Report, disaggregated statistics (victims' gender, age, and nationality, and the type of forced labor they endure), to the extent available, should be provided on the victims, as well as on prosecutions for trafficking-related offenses (arrests, conviction rates, and sentencing). Where such information is not available, the Trafficking Report should note governments' failure to compile and publish disaggregated statistics and urge them to do so.  The Trafficking Report lacks specificity. The Trafficking Report is cursory in important areas, weakening its overall effect. For example, the Trafficking Report often notes that state authorities are corrupt or complicit in trafficking without explaining which authorities are involved, what role they play in the trafficking, and what corrective actions have been taken. A case in point is Burma: The Trafficking Report notes that Burma has not made efforts to address widespread corruption, but does not describe which corrupt agencies or officials are involved in trafficking. More concrete information is needed for the Trafficking Report to be effective at every level in the campaign against trafficking. At a minimum, the Trafficking Report should specify whether a country's legislation penalizes trafficking into all forms of forced labor (not just forced prostitution); which types of government agents are complicit in trafficking, and what measures have been taken to investigate and prosecute them; whether the country is failing to vigorously investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses, and what appears to be the reason for such failure; whether the country has effective government-funded witness protection and victim services programs, and whether all trafficking victims have access to those programs; and whether the country is a party to the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (the Trafficking Protocol).  The Trafficking Report fails to explain Tier movement. The Trafficking Report should describe the justification for moving countries from one Tier to another (within the three-level """"Tier"""" scheme devised for the Trafficking Report). Failing to do this jeopardizes the credibility of the Tier system. For example, the Trafficking Report does not explain why Pakistan was moved from Tier 3 last year to Tier 2 this year. We believe the decision was inappropriate, given that Pakistan has not signed the Trafficking Protocol, has no national legislation criminalizing all forms of trafficking, and provides little in the way of victim services. The Department of State may have evidence that Pakistan has improved its performance since last year, but by failing to specify the grounds for moving Pakistan from Tier 3 to Tier 2, it has fueled concerns that Pakistan's inclusion in Tier 2 is a reward for its role in the war against terrorism. Clarifying the rationale behind Tier movement is critically important since those countries that appear in Tier 3 next year may be subject to non-humanitarian and non-trade-related aid sanctions.   The State Department's Trafficking Report is an important document for assessing other states' anti-trafficking measures and for recommending change, but it must be improved. To protect the millions of actual and potential trafficking victims around the world, we ask that you take a critical look at the Trafficking Report and ensure that all future reports evaluate the effectiveness of anti-trafficking efforts, include disaggregated statistics on trafficking victims and prosecutions, provide more specificity on issues such as corruption, prosecutions, and service programs, and explain the reasons for moving countries from one Tier to another.

We take seriously your concerns regarding our report and are eager to address them. We regret that these concerns were not raised during meetings with government officials we had in November 2001-before publication of our report-and March 2002 so that we could have addressed them at that time. You identify five specific areas of concern in your letter: research methodology, knowledge of Spanish law, procedural guarantees with respect to appeals, allegations of fundamental rights violations, and access to detention centers. Each issue is addressed in full below.   Your critique of the report first alleges that there were problems with the """"methodology of the investigation,"""" noting that the research was based on sketchy interviews and newspaper articles, and failed to include interviews with responsible government authorities. Our research included individual, in-depth interviews with more than thirty migrants who recently had been detained in either the Fuerteventura or Lanzarote facilities upon their arrival to the Canary Islands. In addition, we met with doctors and Red Cross volunteers and staff who worked in the detention centers and were familiar with the conditions in both facilities. We also interviewed a number of lawyers working for the Colegio de Abogados and for non-governmental organizations-all of whom had significant experience working with migrants either before, during, or after their detention in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote.   Your concern that we interviewed """"no competent personnel working in the area of foreigners"""" also surprises us given the fact, noted in the report, that we requested access to the detention facilities and interviews with government authorities present in the Canary Islands, including with your office and with the police. Your office and many other government officials, with the exception of the Minister of Labor and Social Affairs, denied our requests for meetings. After the conclusion of our research in the Canary Islands, however, we interviewed responsible government officials within the Ministry of Interior based in Madrid. In particular, we met with Carlos Guervós, Deputy Director of Immigration, Ministry of Interior; and Manuel Prieto, Head of Foreigners and Documentation Department, Spanish National Police, Ministry of Interior.   The assertion in your letter that the sources we used were """"limited"""" is perplexing, as we managed to poll not only migrants themselves, but medical, legal, and humanitarian workers with direct knowledge of the conditions and procedural rights abuses suffered by migrants in the Canaries facilities. Moreover, we would certainly consider the government officials with whom we met competent personnel working in the area of foreigners. Our research is both comprehensive and objective as it sought to obtain and reflect the perspectives of a wide variety of governmental and non-governmental actors as well as migrants who had been detained in the very facilities under scrutiny.   You also allege that our report reflects a misunderstanding of Spanish law and, as a consequence, recommends government action that is not appropriate. In particular, you point out that our recommendation that judges receive training or guidance on the foreigners' law """"makes no sense in a system in which judges constitute a specialized professional group . . . and have an obligation to know the law."""" Given that the law and its implementing regulations are relatively new and that the majority of Spanish judges are not specifically trained in immigration matters, it would seem critical to the fair and equitable application of the law that judges applying this law receive some form of guidance or training. We do not believe that objective guidance intended to ensure fair application of the law, including, for example, that judges understand the requirement of judicial oversight and their integral role in the immigration system, would interfere with the independence and integrity of the judicial system. On the contrary, it could reduce contradictory decisions and incorrect application of Spanish immigration law. The notion that judges should receive training in specialized areas of the law and in the proper implementation of new legislation is supported by the operation of judicial training programs in many countries, including the Judicial School of the General Council of the Judiciary in Spain.   With regard to the issue of whether an asylum application prevents the continuation of expulsion proceedings, we are concerned that your office has misunderstood the report. Indeed, our report acknowledges that, as you assert, Spanish asylum law """"establishes that the asylum seeker cannot be expelled until his petition has been denied or resolved."""" Our concern is not with the law, but with its interpretation by some lawyers representing asylum seekers in the Canary Islands. Our interviews indicated that some lawyers erroneously believed that once expulsion proceedings had begun, a subsequent asylum claim had no suspensive effect pending a decision on an asylum claim. Consequently, these lawyers mistakenly advise their clients to forego asylum claims. As with many of the procedural rights concerns we address, this particular point of concern highlights the conflict between the law and its application. It is often the misapplication of the law that is most troublesome in the case of migrants' and asylum seekers' treatment in the Canary Islands.   Regarding your third area of concern, you suggest that our recommendation that migrants be given """"the opportunity to challenge the lawfulness both of their detention and deportation order in a judicial proceeding or before another competent authority"""" is unnecessary. You assert that there are already safeguards in place for appeals and that our analysis is ill informed because expulsions require an administrative appeal, while """"a cautionary measure of detention"""" is appealed before the judge who issued the detention order. You are correct that the law provides for an opportunity to challenge the lawfulness of detention and deportation. Our research indicated, however, that in practice migrants and asylum seekers have little or no effective opportunity to avail themselves of the right to lodge such challenges, whether before an administrative or judicial authority. Migrants and asylum seekers are denied this opportunity through a combination of factors, including the poor quality of legal representation; the scarce availability and neutrality of translation and interpretation services; and inadequate information about their legal rights.   As you note in your letter, the Deputy Ombudswoman has highlighted her concerns about the collective nature of legal assistance available to migrants arriving in the Canary Islands, a situation that is currently under investigation. What you term an """"irregularity in legal assistance"""" is indeed a violation of fundamental rights and has a profound effect on the ability of migrants and asylum seekers to exercise the range of rights guaranteed to them under the law. The right to be informed of one's rights in a language that one understands and to be counseled in a manner that affords a detainee the effective opportunity to challenge her or his detention is a fundamental human right enshrined both in international and regional law.   In the same vein, your letter suggest that admitted deficiencies in the detention facilities do not amount to violations of fundamental rights, pointing to the absence of any reference to fundamental rights in the Deputy Ombudswoman's assessment of detention conditions. You also take issue with our concern that non-governmental organizations are hindered in their ability to monitor or otherwise access the facilities to provide migrants and asylum seekers necessary legal and social services.   The poor conditions in the detention centers-well-documented restrictions on communication; lack of meaningful access to lawyers, translators and interpreters, and information regarding legal rights; and inadequate sanitary conditions in combination with inadequate access to health care-clearly violate Spain's obligations under international, regional, and domestic law. We were disappointed to hear in meetings with the Ministry of Interior that there were no immediate plans to improve the current conditions, even though these facilities are expected to continue to serve as temporary detention centers when it is impossible to accommodate all arriving migrants in more appropriate detention facilities.   Finally, with regard to the issue of monitoring the facilities, we reiterate our recommendation that non-governmental and humanitarian organizations and lawyers should have access to the detention centers. Our research indicated that the monitoring mechanisms you note in your letter-for example, law enforcement and judicial oversight, and action by the attorney general-are not yet functioning effectively. They have consistently failed to acknowledge the need for clear guidelines-in conformity with international and regional standards-on conditions of detention. They have also failed to implement in Fuerteventura even temporary solutions the range of rights violations documented in our report.   As for the lawyers who have access to the facilities, we received numerous reports that they do not regularly visit the facilities and that most migrants and asylum seekers remain ignorant of their rights under Spanish law. The only organization with official access to the facilities is the Spanish Red Cross, which is a neutral humanitarian organization that cannot speak out about rights violations suffered by migrants while maintaining their neutral service mandate.   Thus, currently existing monitoring mechanisms have not ensured the protection of migrants' and asylum seekers' fundamental rights. Accordingly, we recommended the creation of a neutral monitoring body capable of providing an independent and objective assessment of the conditions prevailing therein. We also recommend permitting certain organizations and lawyers to visit the facilities in order to ensure that migrants and asylum seekers receive all essential services guaranteed them by human rights law.   We appreciate your bringing the aforementioned concerns to our attention and hope our response clarifies any misconceptions about our reporting. Furthermore, we welcome your stated commitment to maintaining transparent and rigorous efforts to ensure exemplary treatment of migrants and asylum seekers arriving to the Canary Islands, and hope that our report will help to inform this process. We look forward to a continuing dialogue with the Spanish government regarding immigration and asylum issues.

During his first official visit to Washington as president-elect, Uribe is expected to meet President Bush and cabinet officials, including Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld. Colombia is the third highest recipient of U.S. military aid, after Israel and Egypt, and is expected to receive at least $ 378 million in FY 2002 alone. This month, both houses of the U.S. Congress voted to remove restrictions that aid be used only for counterdrug operations, allowing U.S. trained and equipped troops to take part in counterterrorist operations.  The Colombian military is seeking U.S. assistance in its fight against guerrilla forces, chiefly the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The FARC commits serious human rights and humanitarian law abuses, among them massacres, targeted killings, kidnaping, and indiscriminate attacks with gas cylinder bombs.  At the same time, the Colombian military has maintained links with and failed to effectively confront paramilitary organizations that were responsible last year for dozens of massacres of Colombian civilians. On September 10, 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell placed the main paramilitary group in Colombia on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.  """"Uribe must demonstrate to the world that he will attack all sources of terror in Colombia, including paramilitaries that continue to have the active support of Colombia's military,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If he weakens the guerrillas at the expense of strengthening the paramilitaries, Colombian democracy will continue to be as embattled as it is today.""""  Since 1997, all U.S. military aid has been conditioned on Colombia's progress in meeting human rights conditions, among them breaking persistent links to paramilitary groups. The U.S. Senate took another step in its latest package, designating funds for the first-ever anti-paramilitary brigade to support efforts to pursue and arrest paramilitary leaders. There is continuing concern about Uribe's commitment to combating paramilitaries. As governor of Antioquia, one of Colombia's most violent states, Uribe recruited hundreds of civilians to work as spies and extra fighters in army-led operations, a program sponsored by the central government that he developed aggressively.  Human Rights Watch found that these groups, called """"Convivirs,"""" were poorly supervised and regulated, and several were formed by known paramilitaries leaders or became criminal gangs. Among them was a """"Convivir"""" in La Ceja, Antioquia, that was linked by government authorities to a series of killings in 1996 and 1997, when Uribe was governor.  During his campaign, Uribe kept as a close adviser Gen. (ret.) Rito Alejo del Río, who was fired in 1999 by President Andrés Pastrana for his alleged support of paramilitary groups while in command of the Seventeenth Brigade in Antioquia between 1995 and 1997, when he worked closely with Governor Uribe. That year, the United States canceled Del Río's visa to the United States because of his alleged involvement in acts of terrorism and drug trafficking.  Uribe and his current nominee for the combined ministries of Interior and Justice, Fernando Londoño, were the only featured speakers at a dinner that honored Del Río and another fired general as Colombian heroes.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

Governor Pataki and New York politicians in Albany are now debating legislation to reform these drug laws Releasing a new report with the first statistics on the number of children in New York who have had parents sent to prison for drug offenses, Human Rights Watch said the statistics should spur a swift agreement on major reform of the state's drug laws. """"Children of incarcerated drug offenders are one of the collateral casualties of the state's war on drugs,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. """"Disproportionately harsh drug sentences have not only led to the unnecessary incarceration of tens of thousands of low-level drug offenders, but also deprived thousands of children of their parents."""" In Collateral Casualties: Children of Incarcerated Drug Offenders in New York, Human Rights Watch presents a statistical snapshot developed from state and federal data. Among the findings: An estimated 23,537 children currently have parents in New York prisons convicted of drug charges. An estimated 11,113 currently incarcerated New York drug offenders are parents of children. Since 1980, an estimated 124,496 children have had at least one parent imprisoned in New York on drug charges. Some 50 percent of mothers and fathers in New York prisons for drug convictions do not receive visits from their children. Human Rights Watch has consistently urged New York to eliminate harsh mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders and to authorize judges to tailor criminal sanctions that reflect the individual offender's conduct and other relevant factors. Restoring fairness and proportionality to New York's drug laws would reduce the number of drug offenders needlessly sent to prison. For many low-level nonviolent drug offenders, alternatives to incarceration-including community-based sanctions and drug treatment programs-would be a """"punishment that fits the crime."""" By reducing the number of offenders sent to prison, the state would also reduce the number of children who must suffer from losing a parent to prison. """"Safeguarding communities and protecting families from drug trafficking and drug abuse are important public interests,"""" said Fellner. """"But the means chosen to combat drugs should neither violate human rights nor inflict unnecessary collateral harm."""" No New York agency tracks the number of children who have parents in prison. Human Rights Watch derived its figures from New York State Department of Correctional Services data on incarcerated drug offenders and from the results of a survey of a representative sample of New York prison inmates conducted in 1997 for the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the U.S. Department of Justice. The survey yielded data on such questions as the percentage of inmates who have children, the size of their families, current caregivers and the frequency with which the incarcerated parents are in contact with their children.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights"

On Tuesday, delegates reported being subject to intimidation by warlords and surveillance by agents of the Afghan intelligence service. On Wednesday, despite this ominous atmosphere, the delegates debated Afghanistan’s future in full legislative session. There is a clear desire by the legitimate delegates to make the loya jirga work, to select a civilian government committed to peace and rebuilding,” said Saman Zia-Zarifi, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. “Both their hope and their fear are visible.”  On Tuesday, warlords not appointed to the assembly were allowed inside the tent where the loya jirga is in session, mingling with the delegates and threatening those who called for their exclusion or opposed their agenda. Several delegates, including some women, reported threats when they complained about the warlords’ participation in the grand national assembly. Other delegates reported alarm at the heavy presence of agents from the Afghan Intelligence Service (Amniat-e Melli).  “After subverting the voting process in many regions of Afghanistan, the warlords are now trying to hijack the loya jirga itself,” said Zia-Zarifi. “If the warlords succeed in their nefarious quests the security of the Afghan people will be put squarely in the hands of those most likely to threaten it.”  The loya jirga was delayed for one day during which U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was instrumental in sidelining the former Afghan king, Zahir Shah. The king subsequently renounced any role in governing Afghanistan. Khalilzad’s active intervention was in stark contrast to the U.S. government’s failure to implement the Bonn agreement’s exclusion of warlords from the loya jirga.  Delegates, regardless of their political affiliations, expressed consternation at U.S. intrusiveness in undermining the popular former king. “It has created the perception among Afghans that the U.S. is preempting the loya jirga’s choice,” said Zia-Zarifi.  According to delegates interviewed by Human Rights Watch, a number of the most prominent warlords gathered Monday night to divide power in the next government.  In response, several women delegates complained publicly about the presence of figures widely held responsible for Afghanistan’s devastating decade of civil war and ensuing atrocities.  “The Bonn agreement was drafted to increase the involvement of legitimate representatives of Afghan civil society and to decrease the power of warlords,” explained Zia-Zarifi. “For the Bonn project to succeed, the international community must increase security, intensify human rights monitoring, and exclude the warlords from the loya jirga.”  Candidates with a history of human rights abuses were to be excluded from the loya jirga under Article 14 of the procedures governing the loya jirga. It states that delegates “should not have been involved in … abuse of human rights, war crimes, looting of public property… and not have been involved indirectly or directly in the killing of innocent human beings.”  A woman delegate, who asked to remain anonymous, told Human Rights Watch, “We are hostages of the people who destroyed Afghanistan. They [the warlords] are trying to hold us hostage to their power.” Consistent with reports from many others, the delegate went on to describe efforts to coerce delegates. “There are petitions being circulated and we are pressed to just sign them without reading them, to agree with what is being said about who should be a candidate or chairman or have positions in the government. But we aren’t given a chance to read these decisions, they just say ‘sign it.’”  The same delegate told Human Rights Watch that as a result of a public complaint she had been threatened by men associated with one of the warlords: “They told me, ‘you either mend your ways or we will mend them for you.’”  Other delegates said they were troubled by the intrusive presence of agents of the Afghan intelligence service and their obvious efforts to monitor the delegates’ discussions. The intelligence service is widely believed to be dominated by the forces of the predominantly ethnic Tajik Shura-yi Nazar, a political group founded by former president Rabbani and the late Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Shah Massoud. This party currently holds the key cabinet posts of defense, interior, and foreign affairs.  One delegate, an experienced Afghan journalist, told Human Rights Watch, “Amniat [the Afghan intelligence service] was checking people, overhearing conversations, looking into rooms. They were marching around with a camera, photographing people. There were also plainclothes security police with cameras. We recognized them from the old days [under Communist president Najibullah].”  Another delegate said that the intelligence agents had received credentials granting them full access to all areas of the loya jirga compound, contrary to the delegates’ expectations. Officials of the loya jirga confirmed this.  “There is an urgent need for the security forces to protect the delegates from outside intimidation,” said Zia-Zarifi. “The special commission of the loya jirga and the United Nations should immediately remove any partisan from the loya jirga area.”","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""

Despite progress since the early 1990s, Human Rights Watch said journalists still risk harassment, physical assaults, and charges of criminal defamation, particularly when they report critically about the activities of public officials.  It takes a lot of courage to name names and do investigative journalism in Albania,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The common thread in the incidents we have documented is official retaliation for coverage of government abuse, corruption, and rights violations.""""  The sixty-page report, """"The Cost of Speech: Violations of Media Freedoms in Albania,"""" documents incidents of violence and intimidation of the press, as well as due process and free speech violations in six defamation trials. Human Rights Watch also reports that Albanian government officials misuse state advertising to put financial pressure on media outlets and interfere with their editorial freedom.  The report is based on Human Rights Watch interviews with dozens of journalists and media professionals, and analysis of scores of court documents, during a three-week investigation in Albania.  Human Rights Watch found that police officers and other officials are often responsible for arbitrary arrests, severe beatings, and serious intimidation of journalists and their families throughout Albania. The violence occurs with near complete impunity. Internal investigations by the police and public prosecution are either nonexistent or entirely inadequate.  Journalists based in the provinces outside the capital Tirana and those affiliated with the opposition media are especially vulnerable to violence and harassment, which grow more intense during election periods when the stakes are higher.  """"Despite the publicity that these serious abuses have received, not a single person has been disciplined or prosecuted,"""" said Andersen. """"This failure to uphold the rule of law and free expression is a worrying sign for the future of press freedom in Albania.""""  Human Rights Watch also reports that civil and criminal defamation laws that fail to meet international standards are a growing concern for the Albanian media.  Defamation is a criminal offence under the Albanian Criminal Code, and the law gives government officials of all levels special protection from critical media coverage in what are known as """"sacred cow"""" provisions. """"These laws have it backwards,"""" Andersen explained. """"In a democracy, public officials must be prepared to withstand more criticism than an average citizen, not less.""""  Human Rights Watch researchers found that journalists facing defamation charges are routinely denied fair trials, often resulting in excessive and unsubstantiated financial sanctions against them. The report identifies numerous rights violations committed in six recent defamation cases.  """"What is striking about these cases is the failure of the Albanian courts to follow the binding law of the European Convention on Human Rights,"""" Andersen said. """"This reveals a tendency among the judiciary not to take fundamental rights seriously.""""  The Human Rights Watch report also points to biased allocation of state advertising as a major problem for the press in Albania. Government advertising accounts for a disproportionately large share of total media advertising in Albania, and government officials abuse their financial leverage to put pressure on critical outlets. Human Rights Watch called for tighter regulation of advertising, transparent procedures, and independent monitoring to curb these abuses. Human Rights Watch is concerned that, taken together, these various pressures have a serious, chilling effect on the Albanian media's ability to be a genuine public watchdog. If the press is deterred from reporting on human rights violations, alleged corruption or bad governance generally, the rights and well being of all Albanians are at peril.  To address its concerns, Human Rights Watch called on the Albanian government to: End the tolerated harassment and intimidation of journalists by police and other officials, and ensure that any such incidents are investigated promptly and impartially;  Repeal criminal defamation laws, and reform civil defamation laws to bring them in line with international human rights standards;  Provide systematic training to judges on international human rights law and, in particular, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights; and  Take immediate steps to ensure the unbiased and apolitical allocation of state advertising and subsidies to the press. Human Rights Watch urged the international community to promote media freedom in Albania, recommending that specialized organizations, such as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, monitor and assist the Albanian government in improving its human rights performance. Human Rights Watch also urged international financial institutions to promote media freedom as part of their efforts to curb corruption. In particular, Human Rights Watch said that the development banks should scrutinize advertising practices related to their investments","Europe/Central Asia, Albania","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

In a letter to the European Union heads of state, Human Rights Watch urged the E.U. to take immediate steps to ensure that all laws and policies pertaining to immigration and asylum fully comply with regional and international human rights standards. """"Addressing illegal immigration requires more than reinforcing border controls,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Migrants and refugees are people with fundamental rights who deserve certain protections, whether or not they are entitled to remain in Western Europe.""""  In the letter, Human Rights Watch detailed its research findings on a range of serious and widespread migrants' rights violations in a number of E.U. member states, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Spain, and Greece. Five key areas were addressed, including abuses related to immigrant detention; human trafficking; the return of undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers; the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children; and refugee protection. The letter identifies how current E.U. policy proposals fail to address and even exacerbate these concerns, and puts forward measures to remedy these gaps.  """"Senior E.U. officials must live up to the promises made at the Tampere European Council in 1999,"""" said Andersen. """"That meeting reaffirmed the very principles upon which the E.U. was founded - human rights, democratic institutions, and the rule of law. The current treatment of migrants and refugees in Western Europe betrays those principles.""""  More generally, Human Rights Watch expressed deep concern about the E.U.'s persistent failure to incorporate rights protections into a range of recent legal and policy documents on immigration and asylum, and urged its leaders to uphold human rights.  In its specific recommendations, Human Rights Watch called on the E.U. to:  Include explicit procedural safeguards and guidelines for safe and sanitary conditions of detention - in compliance with regional and international human rights standards - in all immigration and asylum policy proposals that address the issue of immigration detention; and in general refrain from detaining asylum seekers;  Integrate measures for the protection of all victims of trafficking into all of its policy initiatives related to trafficking in human beings;  Take urgent action to ensure that all mechanisms for the return of undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers include safeguards against egregious abuses, such as violations of the right to life, the right to seek asylum, the prohibition against refoulement, the right to equal treatment under the law, and the right to be free from discrimination;  Ensure that the rights and special needs of unaccompanied migrant children are enshrined in all immigration and asylum policy proposals;  Honor the commitments made by E.U. member states at Tampere to uphold a full and inclusive application of the Refugee Convention and the fundamental right to seek asylum, and ensure that measures to combat illegal immigration within the E.U. do not undermine international refugee protection standards. In July 2002, Human Rights Watch will release a report that addresses the arbitrary implementation of the Spanish immigration law. The report details widespread disparate treatment of migrants and asylum seekers depending on point of entry and demonstrates that migrants and asylum seekers arriving in Spain do not enjoy the procedural rights to which they are entitled under regional and international law.","Europe/Central Asia, Belgium, Greece, Spain, United Kingdom","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

Heads of State","06/12/2002","June 13, 2002   Re: Human Rights Watch Concerns Relevant to the June 21-22 European Council Meeting at Seville   To European Union Heads of State:   We write in anticipation of the Seville European Council meeting on June 21-22 to voice concern about the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in the context of European Union (E.U.) action to combat illegal immigration.   Human Rights Watch is a private, international, nongovernmental organization that monitors human rights in over seventy countries worldwide. We are currently engaged in a multi-year project focusing on the human rights of migrants in Western Europe. Our research has revealed a wide range of serious violations of migrants' rights in E.U. member states.   In light of this research, we are deeply concerned about the failure of the E.U. to incorporate rights protections into a range of legal and policy documents issued in recent years on the subject of immigration and asylum. The E.U.'s singular focus on law enforcement efforts to combat illegal immigration ignores the fundamental human rights of migrants and asylum seekers. Recent statements by senior government officials from a number of E.U. member states reflect the continuing neglect of the human rights dimension of migration control.   The actual treatment of migrants and asylum seekers in many member states is a powerful indicator of this disregard for the fundamental human rights of migrants. Our research has revealed a range of serious abuses suffered by migrants in the E.U., including arbitrary detention; gravely substandard conditions of detention; procedural violations in criminal and administrative law proceedings, and in the asylum system; violations of core international refugee protection standards; racial and ethnic discrimination; police abuse; arbitrary and collective expulsions; violations of children's and women's rights; and horrendous abuses of migrants and asylum seekers at the hands of human traffickers, often in complicity with law enforcement officials in E.U. member or accession states.   The development of ever more restrictive immigration and asylum policies resulting in the abusive treatment of migrants and asylum seekers-and the undermining of international refugee protection standards-is not the vision of a union characterized by freedom, security, and justice based on human rights, democratic institutions, and the rule of law as enshrined in the 1999 Tampere European Council conclusions. Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. leaders present at Seville to honor the Tampere conclusions and to ensure that action to combat illegal immigration includes protection and promotion of the rights of migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees.   We focus below on some of the most egregious violations we have found in the E.U. with respect to immigration detention; human trafficking; the return of undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers; the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children; and refugee protection. Our survey of these topics includes analysis of the ways in which current E.U. policy proposals fail to address these concerns, and proposes measures to fill these gaps. We hope that it contributes to your deliberations at Seville.   Immigration Detention  The expanding immigration detention regime in Western Europe and the abuses suffered by migrants and asylum seekers in detention is a source of serious concern. The E.U. has yet to articulate a position on immigration detention that requires member states to observe existing protections for migrants in detention according to well-established regional and international human rights norms.   In the November 2001 Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a Common Policy on Illegal Immigration, the section on compliance with international obligations and human rights focuses exclusively on """"the obligation to protect those genuinely in need of international protection"""" and references members states' obligation to observe the principle of nonrefoulement according to Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR) and the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (Refugee Convention). This narrow approach to the human rights dimension of migration rightly recognizes that those fleeing persecution are entitled to international protection, but fails to acknowledge that all migrants, including undocumented migrants, are entitled to fundamental human rights protections.   The communication goes on to address the issue of a community return policy based on """"common principles, common standards and common measures."""" It states that based on the principles of voluntary as opposed to forced return and the international obligation of states to readmit their own nationals, """"common standards on expulsion, detention, and deportation could be developed."""" (Emphasis added.) This tentative approach to common standards in these areas of immigration management and the emphasis on """"administrative cooperation"""" are regrettable. Indeed, many relevant standards governing these activities exist in regional and international human rights law and need only to be re-articulated and implemented at the E.U. level.   Our research in the Euro-Mediterranean region has highlighted the plight of migrants and asylum seekers detained in appalling conditions with inadequate procedural guarantees. In Spain, migrants detained in old airport facilities in the Canary Islands are housed in gravely substandard facilities in overcrowded conditions with little or no access to regular health care, fresh air or exercise. They have inadequate access to counsel and opportunities to appeal the legality of their detention. Many face obstacles to the right to seek asylum, primarily as a result of the absence of any information about asylum procedures. Aspects of their plight are mirrored in Greece, where we documented extremely substandard conditions of detention for undocumented migrants in police detention facilities in Athens. In both Greece and Spain, the national ombudsmen have publicly criticized these substandard conditions.   The increasing proclivity on the part of some E.U. governments to detain asylum seekers is also a worrying trend. In December 2001, the United Nations Human Rights Committee expressed concern that asylum seekers in the United Kingdom have been detained in various facilities on grounds other than those legitimate under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), """"including reasons of administrative convenience."""" Moreover, the committee noted that some rejected asylum seekers are held in detention """"for an extended period when deportation might be impossible for legal or other considerations."""" The prolonged detention of migrants and asylum seekers who cannot be returned to their countries of origin can amount to arbitrary detention.   The treatment of migrants in detention is a serious human rights problem throughout Western Europe, reflecting a broader trend toward a singularly one-dimensional focus on the law enforcement aspect of migration at the expense of migrants' human rights. With such grievous abuses and policies documented by groups like Human Rights Watch, openly opposed by some humanitarian organizations, and condemned by the offices of national ombudsmen, it would seem that E.U. member states would take a greater interest in identifying and implementing the relevant common E.U. standards for the treatment of immigration detainees. However, there has been little effort to do so in recent E.U. initiatives. E.U. documents that do refer to the rights of migrants and asylum seekers in detention do so in a tentative and non-committal fashion.   Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. to include explicit procedural safeguards and guidelines for safe and sanitary conditions of detention-in compliance with regional and international human rights standards-in all immigration and asylum policy proposals that address the issue of immigration detention. Asylum seekers, in general, should not be detained.   Trafficking in Persons The debate on combating trafficking in human beings at the E.U. level is colored by the general resistance to acknowledging that migrants can be victims of human rights abuses. Governments have focused on law enforcement efforts to combat trafficking but have been slow to recognize that trafficking victims have suffered a grievous human rights abuse.   In February 2001, Human Rights Watch criticized the December 2000 Commission Proposal for a Council Framework Decision on Combating Trafficking for its failure to provide adequate victim and witness protection mechanisms consistent with international standards-in particular, the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which many E.U. member states had signed. The Protocol encourages states to provide a range of social services to trafficking victims and, in appropriate cases, to provide temporary or permanent residence to trafficking victims. A December 2001 version of the Framework Decision acknowledged that """"[t]rafficking in human beings constitutes serious violations of fundamental human rights and human dignity and involves ruthless practices such as the abuse and deception of vulnerable persons, as well as the use of violence, threats, debt bondage and coercion,"""" but still contained no concomitant provision for adequate protection and assistance to victims.   In February 2002, the Commission issued a Proposal for a Council Directive """"on the short-term residence permit issued to victims of action to facilitate illegal immigration or trafficking in human beings who cooperate with the competent authorities."""" The explanatory memorandum accompanying the document stated that the proposal's aim was not victim or witness protection and that only certain trafficking victims-those considered """"useful"""" for the purpose of investigating, arresting, and prosecuting traffickers-would be informed about and be entitled to apply for the short-term permit. Trafficking victims who cannot or will not cooperate with law enforcement authorities would not be eligible for the short-term residence permit and would potentially be subject to arrest, detention, and deportation. The proposal left issues of victim protection and rehabilitation to the discretion of member states.   The flaw in the E.U. approach is its orientation toward the problem of trafficking solely as an element of efforts to combat illegal immigration. This approach gives rise to two categories of victims: those who are willing and able to assist the authorities in prosecutions and those who do not or cannot-without paying due attention to the needs for protection common to all of these victims, regardless of the level of their cooperation with the fight against illegal immigration.   Human Rights Watch's research, in Greece and the Balkans in particular, indicates that trafficking victims often will not or cannot cooperate with the authorities for a variety of reasons. Often the victim fears retaliation from the traffickers or corrupt officials in the country of origin. Trafficking victims who have left children at home are particularly vulnerable to these threats. Some trafficking victims may view the incentives to cooperate with the authorities skeptically, understanding that many so-called protection measures are only temporary and do not provide the type of safety and security they will need in the long term. Child trafficking victims often will not have the confidence or ability to cooperate with law enforcement or judicial authorities. Finally, our research has revealed that many migrants are apprehended, detained, and deported as a matter of first course, their status as undocumented migrants automatically trumping their status as victims of trafficking. There thus remains a serious gap in terms of specific protection measures for all victims in the European-wide anti-trafficking regime. This gap creates a legal vacuum at the E.U. level in which victims who do not cooperate with authorities in criminal proceedings are left without any protection at all. By neglecting the need for such protection for all trafficking victims, the E.U. falls short of the standards outlined in the U.N. Trafficking Protocol and relevant international human rights instruments.   Human Rights Watch urges the E.U. to integrate measures for the protection of all victims of trafficking into all of its policy initiatives related to trafficking in human beings.   Expulsion, Deportation, and Return Both the November 2001 Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on a Common Policy on Illegal Immigration and the April 2002 European Commission Green Paper on a Community Return Policy on Illegal Residents ask whether common standards governing the return of undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers should be developed. Our research indicates that there is an urgent need for common standards that conform to regional and international human rights guarantees to govern return policies. Current expulsion practices in many member states violate, among other things, the prohibition against the arbitrary application of the law, the prohibition against discrimination, the right to seek asylum, the prohibition against refoulement, and, indeed, the right to life.   Our research in Spain, for example, has raised serious concerns about the arbitrary application of Spanish immigration law and how disparate treatment of certain migrants and migrant groups can result in rights abuses in the course of processing undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers for return. Many migrants in Spain receive little to no information on their rights. Procedural guarantees spelled out in the law, such as meaningful access to counsel and interpretation services, are often little more than a technicality. This lack of information impedes some migrants' ability to effectively challenge an expulsion order. For example, none of the dozens of migrants facing Spain's rapid deportation procedure, known as devolución, had meaningful access to counsel, interpretation services or a full and fair individual determination of their potential claims against deportation.   Moreover, the arbitrary application of the Spanish foreigner's law appears to have a disparate and potentially discriminatory impact on certain migrant groups-Algerians, in particular. Our research has revealed that Algerian migrants in Spain were more apt than other similarly situated migrants to be given expulsion orders, thus prohibiting them from seeking regularization in Spain at a later date. Human Rights Watch is concerned that Spanish authorities responsible for implementing the foreigner's law frequently wield excessively broad decision-making powers and appear to interpret the law in an arbitrary manner, having little regard for regional and international obligations against arbitrary and potentially discriminatory treatment. In July 2002, Human Rights Watch will release a report with its findings and recommendations regarding the implementation of Spain's foreigner's law.   Procedural rights violations can also serve as an obstacle to the right to seek asylum. In the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks in the United States, certain migrant groups arriving by boat to Greece were given fifteen-day expulsion notices, without the right of appeal or the ability to apply for asylum. Such policies can result in the violation of a government's fundamental nonrefoulement obligations, resulting in the return of asylum seekers to countries where their lives or freedom could be threatened. The Greek government subsequently reversed this policy under heavy criticism, including from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Athens.   Perhaps one of the most egregious violations affecting migrants in the process of expulsion is the violation of the right to life. Migrant deaths, allegedly at the hands of law enforcement and immigration officials, are a serious continuing concern. Since 1994, deaths during deportation have been reported in a number of West European and E.U. member states, including Austria, Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland. The death of Nigerian asylum seeker Semira Adamu in Belgium in 1998 is just one case where coercion in the process of deportation resulted in the death of an asylum seeker while in the custody-and possibly at the hands-of law enforcement officials. In March 2002, three officers in the Adamu case were charged with assault, battery, and involuntary manslaughter for forcing Adamu's head into an airline pillow just before the plane departed Belgium, and two officers have been charged with criminal negligence for failing to stop the physical coercion. Adamu, aged twenty, died of a brain hemorrhage.   Violations of the right to life, the right to seek asylum, the prohibition against refoulement, the right to equal treatment under the law, and the right to be free from discrimination are serious abuses inflicted on migrants and asylum seekers in the course of expulsion and deportation procedures. The E.U. must take urgent action to ensure that all mechanisms for the return of undocumented migrants and rejected asylum seekers include safeguards against such egregious abuses.   Unaccompanied Migrant Children Unaccompanied migrant children are particularly vulnerable to human rights violations when government agencies charged with their care fail to protect their interests and when they lack access to complaint mechanisms. Some E.U. immigration policy proposals contain vague language regarding the """"special needs of children,"""" but virtually none articulate the fundamental protections guaranteed by international law to unaccompanied migrant children present in E.U. member states.   Our research in Spain highlights our concern that in absence of a specific mandate at E.U.-level to guarantee the rights of unaccompanied migrant children, member states will often fail to provide the special care to which children are entitled under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. We have documented widespread and serious abuses of migrant children in Ceuta and Melilla. Children were subject to illegal expulsions and to beatings by the police; held in severely overcrowded and unsanitary government-funded residential centers; faced extortion, theft, and physical abuse by other children in the centers; and rarely enjoyed the protection of center personnel, even when staff witnessed physical attacks. Some staff also engaged in abusive disciplinary practices, including beatings, collective punishment, and threats of expulsion. Spanish authorities frequently denied children basic health and education sevices guaranteed them in national law, and children in both cities often failed to receive the temporary legal residency status they were entitled to under the law because their legal guardian, the Department of Social Welfare, did not apply for it.   No Spanish government agency actively takes responsibility for ensuring that unaccompanied children in Ceuta and Melilla receive care and protection, and no effective mechanisms exist to facilitate the lodging of complaints by children or the exercise of their right to be heard in all proceedings that affect them, as required by international law. While our research focused on the Spanish autonomous cities in North Africa, nongovernmental organizations across Spain report that unaccompanied migrant children in many regions of the country experience similar abuses.   We urge the E.U. to ensure that the rights and special needs of unaccompanied migrant children are enshrined in all immigration policy proposals.   Refugees and Asylum Seekers The impact of increasingly restrictive asylum and immigration policies on refugee protection standards in the E.U. is a matter of ongoing concern. The Tampere conclusions included a reaffirmation of the right to seek asylum and a commitment to work toward the establishment of a common European asylum system based on the full and inclusive application of the 1951 Refugee Convention. The conclusions also required the harmonization of European asylum policies with """"guarantees to those who seek protection in or access to the European Union."""" Recent developments in European asylum policy, however, have marked a disturbing departure from these fundamental principles, and the harmonization of E.U. asylum policies has resulted in a dilution rather than enhancement of refugee protection standards.   Throughout the E.U., member states have progressively undermined their obligations under the Refugee Convention. Some governments have applied excessively restrictive and non-inclusive interpretations of the Convention, in particular the refugee definition, in ways never intended by the original drafters of the Convention. For example, France and, until recently, Germany have excluded individuals fleeing non-state agents of persecution or situations of state breakdown from refugee protection. Certain E.U. governments, including Austria and the U.K., have questioned the relevancy of the Refugee Convention and have proposed alternative policies that would undermine their obligations under international refugee law.   The right to seek and enjoy asylum is severely under threat throughout the E.U. Restrictive immigration policies, including visa requirements, carriers sanctions, border controls, and the posting of """"airline immigration officers"""" in refugees' countries of origin, have made it increasingly difficult for asylum seekers to exercise their fundamental right to seek asylum through legal channels. As a result, many asylum seekers are forced to enter countries of asylum through irregular and often dangerous and exploitative channels, including the use of people smugglers and human traffickers. Governments have increasingly resorted to immigration detention to penalize asylum seekers who enter through irregular channels and as an alleged deterrent to others, in contravention of the Refugee Convention, which prohibits governments from penalizing refugees who enter countries illegally. The increasing use of """"safe third country"""" and """"safe country of origin"""" policies, readmission agreements, and containment policies, including the notion of an """"internal flight alternative,"""" by E.U. member states has allowed governments to evade their obligations towards refugees and asylum seekers and shift responsibility to other countries, often those least equipped to cope with large numbers of refugees. These policies also risk returning refugees to a country where their lives or freedom may be threatened, in violation of the fundamental principle of nonrefoulement.   Human Rights Watch calls on E.U. leaders meeting in Seville to honor the commitments made by E.U. leaders at Tampere to uphold a full and inclusive application of the Refugee Convention and the fundamental right to seek asylum. We urge you to ensure that measures to combat illegal immigration within the E.U. do not undermine international refugee protection standards.   Conclusion Human Rights Watch has acknowledged the European Union as a leader in the promotion and protection of human rights worldwide. We have lauded the E.U. for consistent principled positions on a wide range of issues, including the abolition of the death penalty, equality between women and men, and respect for privacy and family life. The development and implementation of an E.U.-wide anti-discrimination regime has also been a welcomed advancement in community law.   These efforts, however, should be coupled with respect for the fundamental rights of all persons in the E.U., including migrants, asylum seekers, and refugees. A human rights regime that protects only nationals of member states and those with proper documents falls far short of observing international and regional standards for the protection of all persons in the E.U., without respect to legal status or nationality. It can only be hoped that in its effort to realize Tampere's promise, the E.U. will develop immigration and asylum policies that continue the community's long tradition of respecting fundamental rights.

In March 2002, Iran's parliament (Majles) passed a bill aimed at limiting the widespread practice of torture and the use of forced confessions in criminal trials. On Sunday June 9, the bill was rejected by the Council of Guardians, a body of twelve senior clerics appointed by the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamene'i, whose role is to ensure that all laws passed by the Majles are compatible, in their view, with Islam. The Council argued that the bill would limit the authority of judges to adjudicate on the admissibility of confessions and therefore ruled that the bill was against the principles of Islam. The bill was subsequently sent back to parliament for revision, and will now be reviewed by the legal and judicial affairs committee of the parliament.  The Council's ruling disregards clear prohibitions in Iranian and international law on the use of torture to extract confessions,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"It would permit judges to admit confessions as evidence in criminal trials, even when it was clear that they had been extracted under torture.""""  The Council's decision is contrary to Iran's obligations as a State Party to the United Nations Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT). Article 2 (1) of the Convention requires that states take effective legislative measures to prevent torture. Article 4 (1) requires that states ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The ruling also disregards clear prohibitions under Iran's constitution on the use of torture to extract confessions.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the prohibition on torture that currently exists in Iranian law is limited, and is in need of strengthening and clarification in order to meet international standards. For example, Article 38 of the constitution only prohibits the torture of detainees to extract confessions. The use of torture as a punishment or for other purposes is not specifically prohibited.  Torture has been widespread in Iran, in part because of the lack of a definitive legal prohibition on its use. The parliamentary bill vetoed by the Council of Guardians did not close the loopholes in the existing law. For example, the bill did not uphold the right of detainees charged with a criminal offense to have prompt access to legal counsel, nor did it set limits on the permitted length of time that a detainee may be detained incommunicado. Both practices have long facilitated the use of torture by the authorities. The bill also stipulated that certain categories of suspects are exempted from the safeguards contained in the bill. These include: members of apostate groups, a definition that could include members of the Bahai religious minority; Mohareb (those at war with God), a term that is applied to many types of dissident and government critics; and those accused of espionage, another charge with a very loose definition in Iranian penal law. As drafted, the bill would not have provided sufficient safeguards against torture and falls far short of Iran's international obligations.  """"Now that the bill is back to the legal and judicial affairs committee of the parliament there is another opportunity for legislators to draft a bill that would significantly enhance safeguards against torture in Iranian law,"""" said Megally. """"Legislation in the area of torture prevention is rightly a priority. Parliamentarians should meet the challenge of proposing legislation that would better protect Iranian citizens from torture by state officials.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Iran",""

The president is claiming unfettered power to circumvent the justice system and its safeguards of basic rights,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"There should be a strong presumption that anyone arrested in the United States, far from any battlefield, be granted the full legal protections of the criminal justice system-including the right to counsel and not to be held without charges. Simply accusing someone of working with al-Qaeda does not justify throwing him into a navy brig.""""  According to U.S. officials, al-Mujahir, originally named Jose Padilla, had met with senior al-Qaeda leaders in Pakistan and Afghanistan to plan attacks in the United States, including the detonation of a radioactive """"dirty bomb."""" Al-Mujahir was detained in Chicago on May 8, and then held in New York as a """"material witness."""" This week he was sent to a military base in South Carolina where the U.S. government is holding him as an """"enemy combatant"""" without charges or access to an attorney.  Human Rights Watch noted the contrast between the government's decision to treat al-Mujahir as an enemy combatant and its decision to prosecute the alleged September 11 """"twentieth hijacker,"""" Zacarias Moussaoui, on criminal charges in a federal district court. Both men allegedly came to the United States to carry out acts of violence at the direction of Afghanistan-based al-Qaeda operatives. """"The U.S. government apparently wants to be able to question al-Mujahir while holding him incommunicado,"""" said Roth. """"But the government's legitimate desire to obtain information about terrorist threats does not entitle the president to assume unlimited powers to place in military custody anyone he identifies as a terrorist.""""  Human Rights Watch questions the government's contention that international humanitarian law - or the laws of war - permits the president to unilaterally designate al-Mujahir an """"enemy combatant"""" who may be held by the military without charges or access to an attorney. International humanitarian law applies to the international armed conflict in Afghanistan, but it does not apply to any and all members of al-Qaeda regardless of their individual involvement with that conflict. To maintain its designation  of al-Mujahir as an enemy combatant, the U.S. government would need to demonstrate to a civilian court a clear nexus between his activities and the armed conflict with the United States in Afghanistan. If a court determines he is an enemy combatant, then he may be detained without charges for the duration of active hostilities, but not indefinitely.  If suspects are apprehended outside areas of armed conflict and have no direct connection to the conflict, international humanitarian law is inapplicable. Instead, the protections of international human rights law apply. In the case of a U.S. citizen detained in the United States, the protections of U.S. constitutional law apply as well. These protections include the rights to be formally charged and permitted access to counsel.  """"To permit a government that is at war in one part of the world to place people in military custody without charges elsewhere in the world without demonstrating participation in the armed conflict would create a gaping and dangerous loophole to basic human rights guarantees,"""" Roth said.

Otherwise, the president could detain and hold anyone without charges simply by labeling him a member of al-Qaeda.""""","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial"

Members of the International Labor Organization will debate a new global report on child labor on Wednesday in Geneva.  Some 170 million children around the world work in agriculture, making up 70 percent of all child laborers. Human Rights Watch investigations in Egypt, Ecuador, India and the United States have found that child agricultural workers frequently work under dangerous and grueling conditions.  """"Children working in agriculture far outnumber the kids weaving carpets and stitching soccer balls, who get most of the media attention,"""" said Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. She said children working in agriculture spend long hours in scorching heat, are exposed to toxic pesticides, and suffer high rates of injury.  Human Rights Watch has investigated conditions for children working in Egypt's cotton industry, Ecuador's banana sector, and U.S. commercial agriculture, as well as children who have been bonded into agricultural labor in India. In each country, children frequently earn wages far below the legal minimum, and significantly less than their adult counterparts.  In a new briefing paper released today, Human Rights Watch documents how child agricultural workers may begin working as early as age eight or ten. They commonly work eleven or twelve hours a day, often beginning before dawn. Children in India may work as many as sixteen or seventeen hours a day.  Exposure to pesticides poses one of the greatest threats to the health of child agricultural workers. In the United States, Egypt and Ecuador, children interviewed by Human Rights Watch reported repeated exposure, including working in fields while they were being sprayed. They suffered symptoms of pesticide exposure including headaches, dizziness, rashes, nausea and vomiting. Long-term effects can include cancer, brain damage, birth defects and sterility.  Child agricultural workers suffer high rates of injury from working with sharp tools and heavy equipment. In the United States, child farmworkers account for only 8% of working children, but 40% of all work-related fatalities among minors.  The long hours worked by children in agriculture have severe consequences for their education. In Ecuador, the majority of child banana workers interviewed by Human Rights Watch had quit school before the age of fifteen. In the United States, only 55% of farmworker children ever finish high school. In India, many bonded child laborers working in agriculture have never attended school.  Human Rights Watch urged governments and employers to develop strategies to eliminate harmful child labor in agriculture. The place to start is ensuring compliance with the ILO Convention on the Worst Forms of Child Labor, and explicitly prohibiting all individuals under the age of eighteen from using dangerous tools, hauling heavy loads, working excessive hours, and being exposed to pesticides in the workplace.  Human Rights Watch urged corporations to demand that children's rights be respected in their fields and facilities and those of their suppliers, and to adopt effective monitoring systems to verify compliance with this requirement.","Americas, Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Ecuador, India, Egypt, Global","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

African governments themselves have proposed that the initiative, known as The New Partnership For African Development (or NEPAD), require good governance as one of the criteria for investment in Africa. The """"Code of Governance"""" and """"Peer Review"""" envisioned for NEPAD should explicitly use human rights standards and civil society in Africa should be consulted in their formulation, Human Rights Watch said.  """"The concept of 'peer review' is genuinely a revolutionary one; it's important it be given real content,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. """"The G-8 should encourage African leaders to ensure that fundamental rights are integrated into all NEPAD's policies-- including the right to be involved in discussing them.""""  Human Rights Watch also called for new controls on companies based in G-8 countries that illegally trade in resources from Africa and elsewhere. """"If the G-8 can attack terrorism by freezing financial assets, it can attack human rights abuse by cracking down on companies that trade in 'blood diamonds,' valuable timber, and other scarce resources that are funding some very brutal civil wars,"""" said Mungoven. """"Funds and weapons for these wars are coming from the West, and the G-8 needs to do something about it.""""  Human Rights Watch also asked G-8 countries to help ensure that the new chair of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, who will be from Africa, represents a country with a strong commitment to human rights. In a letter and memorandum to G-8 leaders, Human Rights Watch also outlined concerns about counter-terrorism policy; Afghanistan; the HIV/AIDS crisis; and landmines and small arms.  In the months since September 11, many G-8 members have curbed civil liberties and arbitrarily tightened restrictions on refugees, asylum-seekers and foreigners. Some G-8 leaders have even used the anti-terror campaign to justify human rights abuse, for instance by Russian forces in Chechnya, or have extended new military and economic assistance to repressive governments.  At the same time, some G-8 members have blocked moves to expand the international security force in Afghanistan, leaving a dangerous vacuum, in which extremism and violence can grow. Human Rights Watch urged the G-8 to support urgent measures to improve security in Afghanistan and ensure the exclusion of abusive warlords from the new government, military and police. Human Rights Watch also called for a ministerial-level working group to ensure human rights are fully protected in the G-8's counter-terrorism actions.  Human Rights Watch urged that NEPAD's indicators of good governance include: the effective representation of all sectors of society in government; free access to information and respect for the role of the media; executive respect for the rule of law; independence of the judiciary; the effectiveness of law enforcement institutions; and the capacity for effective service delivery to the poor.","Africa",""

On May 24, security forces killed at least fifteen and perhaps as many as thirty-eight farmers demonstrating against a change in the administrative status of Awassa, the capital of the Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples State. The Ethiopian Human Rights Council (EHRC), an independent human rights group that investigated the Awassa shootings, reported that the police fired indiscriminately at the protestors. Security agents used machine guns mounted on armored vehicles to fire into the group of unarmed farmers. EHRC documented the deaths of twenty-five protesters and found twenty-six more injured. Twelve of those killed were children.  “There is simply no excuse for shooting into crowds of civilians,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. “The Ethiopian government must take immediate steps to ensure that state and federal police cease such practices and prosecute those responsible for shooting demonstrators.”  The Ethiopian federal Ministry of Information acknowledges seventeen deaths, including two policemen.  The Awassa killings come shortly after police shootings in Shambu, Ambo, and other towns in Oromiya State, resulting in five acknowledged student deaths. Oromiya is Ethiopia’s largest and most populous state. A year earlier, police killed at least forty civilians and injured 400 others when they violently cracked down on student demonstrations at the capital’s Addis Ababa University. Rapid deployment forces of the federal and regional police also killed two at a meeting in Siraro Woreda in Oromiya last year. The government has failed to prosecute police officers responsible for shooting at these demonstrators.  In a letter to resident diplomatic and humanitarian communities in Ethiopia, the Oromiya State Council claimed that a lack of non-lethal crowd control equipment was responsible for the March killings. Yet foreign donors have devoted significant resources to improving the capacity of the Ethiopian federal and regional police over the past decade. It is clear under international standards that intentional use of lethal force by law enforcement officials is permissible only when strictly unavoidable to protect life.  “The governments’ unwillingness to permit free assembly, in violation of the country’s constitution, has been a precipitating cause of the recent police abuses,” said Takirambudde. “Ethiopia should lift restrictions on peaceful meetings and to prevent the police from arbitrarily banning and dispersing nonviolent protest demonstrations.”","Africa, Ethiopia",""

Contrary to the rules, many of these delegates have been handpicked by warlords determined to defend regional fiefdoms. The fate of the process, and the country, hinges on whether warlord representatives will outweigh delegates who seek a stable civilian government. An institution that promised the start of a democratic future could instead legitimize a return to the abusive past. A Human Rights Watch mission to southern Afghanistan late last month uncovered numerous instances of warlords subverting the election process through threats, beatings, imprisonment and intimidation. In the provinces of Kandahar, Zabul, Oruzgan, Helmand and Nimroz we heard of warlords selecting their own delegates and forcing them on the population. According to criteria guiding the voting, warlords and others with blood on their hands should be excluded from the process. In fact, the local United Nations office and the special commission for the loya jirga, the Afghan body that designed and oversaw the process, lack the resources adequately to monitor and enforce these criteria. To challenge the creeping power of the warlords, the international security force now confined to Kabul should have been extended to the rest of the country, along with greater numbers of local and international monitors. In the absence of such security, armed regional commanders have filled the power vacuum with their Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers. One of the worst areas was Zabul Province. There authorities associated with Hezb-i-Islami, the radical party of the ruthless former prime minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, have openly subverted the loya jirga process. In the provincial capital of Qalat, the space reserved for the election process was surrounded by armed men. The provincial governor, Hamidullah Tokhi, a senior Hezb-i-Islami figure, arrived with a list of preselected delegates. When one independent figure persisted with his candidacy, provincial authorities threatened to kill him. Not all tampering was so overt. We heard regularly of warlords who simply told the locals that the election observers were only temporary while the warlords would stay on to reckon with anyone challenging their rule. A young man from Gizab told us that """"after 23 years of fighting, people ... have a great fear of the commanders."""" Such fear is aggravated by local perceptions that Washington supports the warlords. Its desire to minimize the commitment of U.S. combat troops has led it to rely for security on local commanders regardless of their human rights records. The U.S. government does not consider this cooperation to constitute active support for warlords, but the distinction is often lost on civilians. To make matters worse, many ordinary Afghans suffer under the false impression that American communications equipment provided to local commanders is directly linked to the fearsome B-52 bombers. In many ways, Afghanistan today resembles the country in the early 1990s. Then the Soviet-sponsored Communist government had just been toppled and regional commanders were consolidating their power before the onset of a savage civil war. A decade later, many of the actors, domestic and foreign, are the same. However, this time the international community has a direct stake in, and considerable influence over, the country's future. It needs to use that influence. Now is the make-or-break time for Afghanistan. If the special commission can ensure that the loya jirga is not dominated by the warlords' delegates, the meeting could go a long way toward creating a better, more inclusive future. But if the warlords are allowed their way, the loya jirga could end up legitimizing and reinforcing their rule. That would move Afghanistan one step closer to renewed civil war.

The Somalis and Ethiopians are likely to face torture and persecution if they are returned. During an investigation in Nairobi in April 2002, Human Rights Watch interviewed twenty-three Ethiopians who said they had fled the country after being tortured in detention. The Somalis risk return to civil conflict - even in the past week, Somali refugees have fled renewed fighting in the Mandera region of Somalia.   The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not been granted free access to the group, who are being held at the Kasarani police station in Nairobi, to ascertain whether any of them are refugees.   This is not the first time that the Kenyan government is flouting its obligations under international refugee law. In its April 2002 investigation, Human Rights Watch documented numerous instances in which refugees or asylum seekers living in Nairobi were forcibly repatriated after being arrested by the police.   As a result of the sweeps, the Kenyan government is also detaining one hundred and forty-five documented refugees, the majority of whom are from the Ethiopian Oromo ethnic group and one-third of whom are children, at the Gigiri police station near Nairobi. The government is planning to relocate these refugees to camps in the remote northeast of the country. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the relocation may separate the children, many of whom are detained without their parents, from their families. It could also deny torture victims and others specialized medical care available only in Nairobi.   The one hundred and forty-five refugees have been charged with failing to register with the government of Kenya, a statutory violation that is being enforced for the first time. But no refugee is able to comply with the statute because there has been no governmental registration service for the refugees since 1991. Prior to 1991, the Kenyan government was conducting its own refugee status determination and registration. However, with the arrival of large numbers of refugees from Somalia and Sudan in 1991, the government handed the processing of refugees over to UNHCR.   Foreigners, including refugees, are often blamed for crime and insecurity and targeted for arbitrary arrest and detention in Kenya. Similar round-ups occurred in September 1998, when refugees had to surrender their """"protection letters"""" from UNHCR, without being given replacement identity documents. More recently, group arrests of thirty to one hundred foreigners occurred in October 2001 and twice during February 2002. Individual non-nationals are harassed and arrested on a daily basis in large cities, particularly in Nairobi.   Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan government to properly assess the status of the detainees before repatriation, to put into place immigration policies that accord with international human rights, refugee law and Kenyan law, and to end police harassment of refugees and asylum-seekers.","Africa, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

The latest economic plan, passed Wednesday night, cuts by 24 percent allowances for children whose parents have not served in the army. The majority of Palestinian Arab citizens are exempt from military service. Their children will bear the brunt of the cuts. The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children. Israel distributes sums of money to all parents based on the number of their children; allowances for all children were cut by 4 percent. """"The government should not discriminate against children on the basis of their parents' military service,"""" said Zama Coursen-Neff, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Palestinian Arab children are the poorest in Israel, with the least access to education. These cuts will disadvantage them even more."""" Human Rights Watch, in a December 2001 report, found that Israel systematically discriminates against Palestinian Arab citizens in its public school system. While the report documented differences in all aspects of government-provided education, it also found that parental funding played a role. Jewish households spend more on their children's education, and the government's programs widen the resulting gaps by subsidizing parent-funded education, contributing more to Jewish parents' organizations than Palestinian Arab parents' organizations, and distributing compensatory programs inequitably. The government has admitted that it spends more on education for each Jewish child than for each Palestinian Arab child. """"Palestinian Arab school children face larger classes, fewer special education and vocational programs, worse school buildings, and less well-trained teachers than their Jewish counterparts,"""" said Coursen-Neff.

In a letter to Azerbaijani President Heidar Aliev, Human Rights Watch called upon the government to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force in response to any unlawful acts committed during public protests. Armed police continue to blockade the town, and the situation remains tense.  The authorities have arrested more than twenty people from Nardaran since June 3 and are holding them in incommunicado detention. Relatives report that they have been provided no information as to the whereabouts of those detained or whether any criminal charges have been filed against them. Lawyers and doctors have not been permitted access. In recent years, Human Rights Watch has documented widespread torture of detainees in Azerbaijan, particularly of those held incommunicado. In recent months residents of Nardaran, a town of 8000 people twenty-five kilometers north of Baku, have threatened to mount protests over chronic poverty, unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, unaffordable public transport, and gas and electricity shortages. On June 3 the authorities arrested eight Nardaran elders they had invited to discussions about appointing a new representative of the district council, and sent a large force of police and interior ministry troops into the town to make more arrests.  Residents of Nardaran immediately mounted demonstrations to protest the arrests. After 9:00 pm, security forces clashed with a large crowd of protesters on the main square. During a reported hour-long stand-off, hundreds of Nardaran residents threw stones and some petrol bombs, and security forces fired automatic weapons. Fifty-three-year-old Nardaran resident Alikhasan Agaev was shot dead; a dozen other inhabitants sustained serious bullet-wounds, and fifty more are said to have suffered minor bullet injuries. Security forces withdrew shortly after midnight. Domestic human rights monitors who later investigated at the scene report that sections of the town were riddled with bullet holes, and littered with spent AK-74 bullet cartridge cases.  """"Azerbaijan's government has a record of responding to protests of social grievances with beatings, detentions, and show trials, but firing on protesters with assault rifles is a new low"""", said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government must conduct a serious investigation of this matter and take appropriate legal action against anyone, including members of the police, who used force unlawfully.""""  Many people who sustained gunshot wounds have still not had medical attention. Reports that some of the wounded and those assisting them were beaten or arrested at hospitals have discouraged others from leaving Nardaran, and a domestic rights group reports that police have prevented doctors from accessing the town.  In late 2000 and early 2001 popular discontent with the authorities' conduct of parliamentary elections, which international observers branded as fraudulent, provided a catalyst for local protests about economic and social conditions in several towns across Azerbaijan, including Sheki, Djalilabad, Agdash, Nardaran, and also by handicapped war veterans. The government's harsh repression of such protest had a chilling effect that lasted until the inhabitants of Nardaran resolved to begin new protests this January.  """"President Aliev's government must learn to engage constructively with peaceful protest. With conduct of elections the way it is in Azerbaijan, peaceful protest is just about the only legitimate avenue most ordinary Azerbaijanis have left for expressing social grievances,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen.

In several provinces, the warlords are associated with the Taliban and the extremist Islamist movement led by former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Human Rights Watch, which has monitored conditions in Afghanistan throughout the military conflict, said the warlords are stepping into a power vacuum created when the U.S.-led military coalition failed to support the extension of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) outside of Kabul. The mounting repression and lawlessness facing Afghan civilians are dashing hopes that the June 10-16 meeting of the loya jirga will have credibility in selecting the next government.  """"Warlords are making a power grab by brazenly manipulating the loya jirga selection process. If they succeed, Afghans will again be denied the ability to choose their own leaders and build civil society,"""" said Sam Zia-Zarifi, a senior researcher with Human Rights Watch. """"This is a make-or-break time for Afghanistan's future.""""  The Briefing Paper, “Afghanistan: Return of the Warlords,” reports on a Human Rights Watch mission to southern Afghanistan in late May. HRW researchers gathered information about the loya jirga process and general security conditions in five southern provinces: Kandahar, Helmand, Nimroz, Oruzgan, and Zabul. In every province, HRW recorded instances of violence, intimidation, and general insecurity undermining the fairness of the first stage of the loya jirga selection process. In several cases, Human Rights Watch documented independent candidates being detained or beaten by local commanders intent on sending their own delegates to the loya jirga. More often, warlords simply drew up their own lists of delegates and insisted that the local populace approve them.  In Zabul province, where warlords in the ascendancy are associated with the Taliban and the extremist movement led by former Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmaytar, provincial authorities seem to operate mostly outside the authority of the Afghan Interim Administration and to be openly hostile to the Bonn Agreement’s blueprint for a post-Taliban Afghanistan.  The United Nations and the Special Independent Commission for the Emergency Loya Jirga are responsible for overseeing the voting process. They were generally successful in limiting violence during the actual voting for the loya jirga. But Human Rights Watch found that these institutions often did not have the resources to adequately monitor and enforce the selection criteria for the loya jirga, which were supposed to exclude delegates who had engaged in human rights abuses, criminal activity, or the drug trade.  """"Without proper international security support, the monitors could not be expected to prevent the warlords from subverting the process,"""" Zia-Zarifi said. """"The U.N. and the Special Commission now have one week to exclude delegates with abusive pasts and to select other delegates who are committed to the rule of law in Afghanistan.""""  Human Rights Watch called for the following urgent steps to be taken:  The United States should immediately halt its apparent policy of relying on local warlords to provide security and troops to its war effort without apparent regard for their human rights record.  The United Nations Security Council should extend international security forces throughout Afghanistan both during and after the loya jirga.  The Special Commission for the Loya Jirga should challenge all delegates who do not meet the eligibility requirements set out in the Special Procedures for the loya jirga, particularly those concerning a history of abuse or criminality.  The Special Commission for the Loya Jirga should use its appointment power to ensure that the loya jirga is not dominated by delegates representing warlords hostile to the Bonn Agreement.  The new Afghan government should implement mechanisms envisioned in the Bonn Agremeent, such as the Human Rights Commission and the Civil Service Commission, to begin building a system of accountability for those involved in serious violation of human rights","Asia, Afghanistan","United Nations, Women's Rights"

The State Department is taking this issue more seriously. But it's a shame that one can still read these reports and end up not knowing basic facts. For this report to be relevant, specificity matters,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, Executive Director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It's crucial that each country chapter relay basic information about how many people are trafficked into, through, and from it; the types of forced labor for which people are trafficked; the number of actual prosecutions and convictions for trafficking; and how many state agents have been investigated, tried, and convicted for trafficking-related offenses.""""   The State Department released the 110-page report yesterday to comply with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The report evaluates the performance of 89 countries, putting each country in one of three categories depending on how its domestic efforts meet the legislation's minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Tier 3 countries are deemed to be not in compliance with the minimum standards and not making significant efforts; Tier 2 countries are not in compliance, but making significant efforts; and Tier 1 countries are in compliance. The report covers countries worldwide with a """"significant number"""" of trafficking victims.   One of the consistent failures of the report is that it does not evaluate the effectiveness of government programs and is often vague about the details of those programs. Moreover, Tier 2, where fifty-two countries fall, seems to be a catch-all category, encompassing countries of disparate trafficking records.   Human Rights Watch also noted that Pakistan, an ally in the U.S. government's fight against terrorism, has moved from Tier 3, where it was in last year's report, to Tier 2 in this year's, even though the State Department's latest human rights report indicated that Pakistan """". . . has done little to stem the flow of women trafficked into the country or to help victims of trafficking.""""   """"There is little evaluative information in the report,"""" added Jefferson. """"Noting that governments have undertaken preventive or remedial programs is only half of the equation. The other half has to be an assessment of whether those programs are properly constructed and effectively implemented.""""   Human Rights Watch noted that the report has improved since last year, in part by more consistently addressing trafficking into all forms of forced labor, not just into """"sexual exploitation"""" and including more information on victims' services. However, the report is still generally unclear about whether there is direct government funding for victims' services. In addition, although many country chapters mention government corruption and complicity, they should be consistently clearer about exactly which type (border guards, police, immigration officials, etc.) of government officials are implicated.   Human Rights Watch urges the State Department to:   Ensure that all future reports include all reliable data on the number of trafficking victims in each country, disaggregated by age, sex, nationality, and the nature of their forced labor; Ensure that all future reports include reporting on the number of prosecutions for trafficking-related offenses, including concrete information on conviction rates, sentencing, and the involvement of state agents; Ensure that all future reports provide the number and positions of public officials who have been proved to be involved in trafficking, as well as the corrective measures that have been taken to remedy this complicity;  Include specific information on the nature and effectiveness of services available to trafficking victims and whether those services are directly government-funded and provided; and  State explicitly for each country report whether the country has signed the U.N. Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which supplements the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, which the State Department characterizes as """"an important new tool to facilitate international cooperation.""""  Select illustrations of the report's shortcomings:    Pakistan: Pakistan should be Tier 3. The trafficking report fails to mention that draft trafficking legislation is specific to trafficking for forced labor as camel jockeys, rather than generally for bonded labor, in which 100,000 children are reportedly held within Pakistan, or other forms of forced labor. The report minimizes the abuse that women victims of trafficking face under Pakistan's discriminatory Hudood laws. These laws criminalize extramarital sex and place the burden of proof on the victim, thus discouraging trafficking victims from filing charges. For more information on the discrimination that women face in gaining legal redress in Pakistan, please see:  Pakistan: Women Face Their Own Crisis  Argentina: Argentina provides an example of inconsistencies between the State Department's own reports. The report does not include a summary of Argentina's record on trafficking, even though Argentina is mentioned in the report as a destination country for people trafficked from Brazil and the Dominican Republic. In addition, the latest State Department human rights reports contain information on trafficking of persons into Argentina from Bolivia, Paraguay, and the Dominican Republic. According to recent news reports, 24 trafficked women from the Dominican Republic alone were identified and returned in 2001. International organizations have noted that trafficking is a grave problem in Argentina.   Japan: Japan should be a Tier 3 country. The report mentions only trafficking of women for """"sexual exploitation."""" The report fails to distinguish debt-bondage as forced labor. The Japanese government continues to treat trafficked women as illegal immigrants or criminals. They are often arrested and deported. Traffickers are rarely punished. The report once again minimizes the extent of the Japanese government's refusal to address this issue as a human rights concern and credits Japan for hosting a trafficking conference that was outward looking in nature. For more information on trafficking to Japan, please see:  Thousands of Thai Women Trafficked to Japan  Nigeria: Nigeria should be in Tier 3, given the magnitude of the trafficking problem in Nigeria and the inadequacy of the government's remedial efforts. Although the report mentions Nigeria's draft federal anti-trafficking legislation, it does not cite its shortcomings: the weak provisions on witness protection, victim services, and law enforcement guidelines. The Nigerian government fails to compile and publish disaggregated statistics on trafficking victims and legal proceedings against traffickers.","Africa, Americas, Asia, United States, Argentina, Nigeria, Japan, Pakistan, US Foreign Policy","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Exploitation, Forced Labor & Trafficking, Migrants, Domestic Workers, Refugees and Migrants"

Human Rights Watch's research has revealed that efforts to combat illegal immigration and the development of ever more restrictive immigration and asylum policies have led to rampant abuses against migrants and asylum seekers in many E.U. member states.  """"Existing immigration policies already result in widespread, serious violations of migrants' rights,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Seville will usher in a whole new wave of abuse unless E.U. leaders begin to acknowledge that migrants-even those with no right to remain in Western Europe-have basic human rights.""""  Human Rights Watch has been engaged in a multi-year research and advocacy project on the human rights of migrants in Western Europe. The project, initiated in 2000, has revealed a range of migrants' rights abuses in several European Union member states, including:  Arbitrary detention  Gravely substandard conditions of detention Procedural violations in criminal and administrative law proceedings, and in the asylum system Racial and ethnic discrimination Police abuse Arbitrary and collective expulsions Violations of children's and women's rights Horrendous abuses of migrants and asylum seekers at the hands of human traffickers, often in complicity with law enforcement officials in E.U. member or accession states. Human Rights Watch is concerned about the failure of the E.U. to incorporate rights protections into a range of legal and policy documents issued in recent years on the subject of immigration and asylum. The singular focus to date on law enforcement efforts to combat illegal immigration sends a message to member states that they can ignore the fundamental human rights of migrants. Recent statements by senior government officials from a number of E.U. member states reflect the continuing neglect of the human rights dimension of migration control. Human Rights Watch is sending an open letter to all E.U. heads of state attending the Seville summit detailing these concerns.","Europe/Central Asia, Greece, Spain, United Kingdom","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

The organization said it believes authorities arrested Yahiaoui because they had identified him as a writer and editor for the online publication Tunezine, which offers a platform for commentary critical of government repression. As of Thursday afternoon, nearly 48 hours after Yahiaoui’s arrest, his family did not know where he was being held or the basis for his detention. Although Tunisian law requires that the police inform prosecutors of all arrests without delay, the office of the prosecutor in Ben Arous, the suburban jurisdiction where Yahiaoui lives and works, informed the family Wednesday it had no record of his arrest.  Yahiaoui, who hid his identity behind the pen name Ettounsi (“the Tunisian”), was arrested at 7 pm by six plainclothesmen in the Internet café where he worked. The police then took him to his home, where they reportedly conducted a search without a warrant and seized computer disks and equipment belonging to him. The police returned to Yahiaoui’s home on Thursday and questioned family members. The manager of the Internet café where he worked was also reportedly arrested.  Yahiaoui appears to be the first Tunisian arrested for exercising his right to freedom of expression online.  “Yahiaoui’s arrest seems to show both the government’s determination to punish criticism and to keep the Internet from becoming a refuge for free expression amidst a heavily censored print press,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division.  With both state-run and private newspapers under tight control, Tunisians have recently launched online journals such as Tunezine, Kalima, Takriz, and Alternatives Citoyennes that feature independent political views and criticism of human rights violations.  However, internet users in Tunisia are often unable to access these sites because they are blocked by the authorities. Internet use in Tunisia has grown rapidly over the last three years but remains under tight control.  The most recent issue of Tunezine featured several pieces criticizing as anti-democratic the constitutional referendum held on May 26. According to the official tally, 99.52 percent of Tunisian voters approved amendments that enable President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali to run for a fourth term in 2004 and grant him immunity from prosecution.  Yahiaoui, 34, is the nephew of Judge Mokhtar Yahiaoui, who was fired in 2001 after writing an open letter to President Ben Ali denouncing the lack of judicial independence in Tunisia. Today, authorities at Tunis-Carthage airport prevented, without explanation, Judge Yahiaoui from traveling to Paris to attend a conference.

""""Camp residents protest that they had no voice in this and want only to go home,"""" said Des Forges.  Beginning on April 27, soldiers ordered civilians to move immediately to the sites and refused to allow those caught at the market or on the roads to return home to get basic necessities. Authorities provided no shelter, food, water, or sanitation facilities at the sites, in violation of article 17 of the Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions. After spending one night outside in a cold rain, the displaced persons built temporary shelters the next morning.  Authorities have excluded aid workers, saying the area is """"insecure."""" Rebels of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), fighting the Burundian government for the last seven years, make frequent incursions into eastern Burundi from bases in neighboring Tanzania.  Representatives of United Nations agencies were permitted to visit the camps for the first time yesterday in the company of government officials. They reportedly reached agreement on a safe corridor for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to begin later this week.  Authorities also excluded the press and in early May detained two journalists from a national radio station when they attempted to enter one of the camps. After releasing the journalists, authorities warned them not to try to return to the camp. According to camp residents, they are allowed to leave the sites one or at most two days a week which is not enough to allow them to care for their fields and seek supplies at home.  Camp residents accused the military of beating and torture, arbitrary arrests, and prolonged detention in communal lockups. They say the soldiers raped and otherwise assaulted women in the camp. They declared that soldiers force civilians to carry supplies into combat and gave the example of a young man wounded by gunfire in the course of such service.  Soldiers have transformed the Nyabitsinda hospital into a military barracks, forcing the patients out and making it unlikely that sick persons will seek help there. They reportedly used chairs and benches from the local school as firewood to cook goats stolen from local people.  Since 1993 the Burundian army has been fighting the FDD and the National Liberation Front (FNL). In an effort to squash local support for the rebels, military have in the past forcibly regrouped the civilian population.

The 119-page report, entitled Playing with Fire: Weapons Proliferation, Political Violence, and Human Rights in Kenya, documents the dangerous nexus between arms availability and ethnic attacks in Kenya. The report highlights politically instigated armed violence on Kenya's coast during the last general election cycle, in 1997. It calls for decisive action to prevent any such violence as Kenya prepares for general elections later this year.   """"The spread of small arms and the manipulation of ethnic tensions are an explosive mix,"""" said Lisa Misol, researcher with the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"Kenya must stop weapons from getting into the hands of people who would use them to disrupt the vote.""""   For years Kenya has been a conduit for arms shipments destined to nearby areas of violent conflict. More recently the flood of weapons has spilled back into Kenya itself, making the resort to violence more likely-and more deadly.   Since the end of one-party rule in Kenya, election years have been routinely characterized by political violence. Politicians who have been implicated in past incidents of political violence have not been held to account.   Human Rights Watch describes in detail the armed political violence in Kenya's Coast Province in mid-1997 and the role of ruling-party officials in stoking the violence. A quasi-military force of well-organized and well-armed attackers carried out brutal attacks on civilians from other ethnic groups in areas around Mombasa, Coast Province.   In interviews with Human Rights Watch, several individuals involved in the attacks acknowledged their direct participation in the violence and described how it was organized. Their first-hand accounts and other evidence indicate that local ruling party politicians-with support from some national politicians-were instrumental in organizing, supporting, and sustaining the violence in order to displace ethnic communities viewed as likely opposition voters in general elections that were held at the end of 1997. More than a hundred people were killed and some 100,000 people were displaced, bringing to 400,000 the number displaced as a result of political violence since 1992.   A government commission of inquiry was appointed in 1998 to look into ethnic violence in Kenya since 1991. After months of hearing testimony, the commission submitted a report to President Daniel arap Moi in August 1999, but the government has refused to make it public.   """"Kenya and the international community must act, and act soon, to curb the spread of these weapons and bring to justice the people who orchestrate violence for political gain,"""" said Misol.   Human Rights Watch called on the government of Kenya to take action to prevent politically motivated ethnic violence and end impunity for past incidents of violence; ensure accountability of local security structures; and strengthen legal controls, particularly those related to the manufacture, possession, and transfer of firearms and ammunition.","Africa, Kenya",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/29/us-growing-problem-guantanamo-detainees","US- Growing Problem Of Guantanamo Detainees","U.S.: Growing Problem Of Guantanamo Detainees","","05/29/2002","As the U.S. administration prepares to send some 150 new detainees to Guantanamo Bay, Human Rights Watch warned that their legal status is growing more problematic by the day.  In a letter sent this week to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch challenged plans that the Bush administration has floated to pursue troubling lines of prosecution or even to hold the detainees indefinitely without trial.  """"The Bush administration cannot hold people indefinitely without charge or send them to countries where they might be tortured,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"As time goes by and the number of detainees grows, so does the pressure on the U.S. government to act.""""  Roth said that the Bush administration has a legal obligation to determine the detainees' status in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, and then to launch criminal prosecutions where credible evidence exists. The Bush administration could reasonably prosecute some detainees at Guantanamo for conspiracy, so long as it does not define """"conspiracy"""" too broadly.  With the imminent completion of new cells at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo and anticipated transfer of approximately 150 detainees from Afghanistan, the number of persons held at Guantanamo is expected to exceed 500.  Human Rights Watch warned that the US administration had a responsibility not to transfer or repatriate detainees to countries where they may be at risk of torture. The U.S. government has not returned prisoners it captured in Afghanistan to China, for instance, and this policy needs to be applied more widely.  The points raised in the letter include:  Despite President Bush's claim to be applying the """"principles"""" of the Third Geneva Convention regulating prisoner-of-war (POW) status, the United States continues to violate the Geneva Conventions, particularly with respect to Taliban detainees. This shortsighted transgression sets a dangerous precedent that could come back to haunt U.S. and allied servicemembers who are captured by enemy forces in this or future wars. Washington's refusal to treat the detainees as POWs is perplexing because it would in no way inhibit legitimate U.S. efforts to interrogate or prosecute people who have participated in terrorist acts.  There is no legal basis to treat as """"battlefield detainees"""" suspects who are captured outside Afghanistan and have no direct relationship with the armed conflict. In such cases, the designation is a transparent effort to circumvent the requirement of international human rights law that these suspects be criminally charged or freed.  New regulations address many of the faults in President Bush's proposed military commissions, but flaws remain, including the failure to provide appeal to a civilian court, such as the appeal allowed in courts-martial to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces. The lack of independent appeal allows the executive to serve as both prosecutor and judge, undermining public confidence in the proceedings and increasing the possibility of injustice.  It could be appropriate to prosecute the Guantanamo detainees for the crime of conspiracy if a suspect can be shown to have joined a criminal enterprise knowing of its criminal purpose and with the intent of furthering its criminal objectives. But it would be dangerous to apply conspiracy theories too loosely. Given the variety of reasons that Afghans and foreigners joined the Taliban, membership in a criminal conspiracy should not be presumed from mere armed presence in Afghanistan.  The Geneva Conventions permit many of the detainees to be held until the end of active hostilities. But at some stage the genuine armed conflict in Afghanistan will give way to a rhetorical war - more akin to law enforcement efforts against other criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or the mafia, that also involves potential loss of life. At that point, detention without criminal charges is no more appropriate for the Guantanamo detainees than it would be for a street-level drug dealer picked up in any American city.  The U.S. government has a duty to avoid transferring or assisting in the transfer of any detainee to a country where he risks torture. Violation of this duty carries criminal penalties enforceable in principle in any court worldwide.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, International Justice, Guantanamo"

THE recently concluded session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR) confirmed a disturbing trend: despotic governments are increasingly running the show, with the hope of dampening its voice. The commission, which meets each March and April in Geneva, is the UN's leading human rights body. But it may also be defined as an 'Abuser's Defence Society', as was painfully apparent at this year's session. For the past two years, Russia has flouted directives for curbing atrocities in Chechnya so, this year, instead of raising the ante, the UNCHR folded and voted to stop criticising Russia. Conservative elements in Iran are intensifying repression of reformists, so for the first time in nearly two decades the commission voted to end scrutiny of Tehran, abandoning the reformists. China has responded to growing popular discontent with heightened oppression, so for only the third time since the murderous crack-down on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement, the commission didn't even propose condemning Beijing, let alone allow the matter to come to a vote. Behind this abdication was a rogues' gallery of human rights violators, including Algeria, Burundi, China, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Libya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Togo and Vietnam. All had been voted full members of the UNCHR by a selection system that is plagued by perverse incentives. By putting forward only the same number of candidates as available seats, governments from each region effectively select members from among their ranks. But the commission is only one of many UN bodies that governments vie to join. In the developing world, many human rights-respecting governments pursue development-oriented committees, in the hope that they might steer some additional economic assistance their way. But abusive governments tend to place a higher priority on the commission, with the aim of silencing it and avoiding the embarrassment of condemnation. Zimbabwe's election to the body last month, just after narrowly escaping censure, illustrates this dynamic. If this perverse process is to be reversed, Europe needs to play a leading role. First, Europe should encourage developing-world governments with commendable human rights records to become candidates for membership, perhaps by guaranteeing them the economic assistance they fear losing by forsaking development-oriented UN committees. Providing technical support to their understaffed Geneva missions would also help. Second, regional negotiations for membership should be closely scrutinised and, if necessary, condemned. Europe should not stand by silently as governments select a Zimbabwe -or a Syria, Sudan or Cuba. For example, it should be pointed out that the much-vaunted 'peer review' of the New Partnership for African Development means little if African governments fail so miserably to select human rights-respecting governments for the commission. The selection of the next chairman, who according to the usual rotation will come from Africa, is particularly important. Third, Europe should press for the adoption of minimum criteria for membership, such as barring any government that the commission has recently condemned or that has refused to implement directives or admit investigators. Finally, Europe should scrutinise its own conduct at the commission, particularly its growing preference for watered-down, consensus statements rather than condemnatory resolutions. These have been pursued in wholly inappropriate circumstances, such as Chechnya and Iran, when the problem is not, for example, enticing a government to consent to technical assistance but pressing it to develop the political will to respect human rights. The commission is hardly a lost cause. Resolutions this year on Iran, Chechnya, and Zimbabwe lost by only one or two votes, and condemnations of Sudan and Cuba were narrowly approved. But to break the abusers' tightening grip on the commission, Europe must act quickly. If it waits until next year's commission, the deals for membership will already have been struck. The time to act is now.","Europe/Central Asia, Global","United Nations"

On May 24 police in Karshi arrested Yuldash Rasulov, whose work for the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU) focuses on the crackdown on independent Muslims. Rasulov, who is in his thirties, cannot afford independent legal defense, and it is unclear whether he has had access to state-appointed counsel.  """"It seems that Rasulov has no lawyer of his own choice, and Uzbekistan's got a shocking record on torture,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"We're very concerned about what police may be doing to him at this very moment.""""  Police brought Rasulov from Karshi, in Kashkadaria province, to Tashkent, where he is being charged with """"religious extremism."""" According to HRSU, Rasulov has been a member of the rights group since 2000, gathering information on the arrests of those whose religious practices and affiliations fall beyond the confines of state-sponsored Islam. Police claim that Rasulov had been recruiting Islamic militants; HRSU denies that he was involved in any religious """"extremist"""" activities of any sort, much less those aimed at violent challenge to the state. A search of his family's home found nothing incriminating.  Rasulov is known to be a religious man who prays five times per day, which, Andersen said, may explain why police chose to target him. """"Thousands of people are in prison in Uzbekistan because of their religious practices and affiliations. In many of these cases, police considered praying five times per day a suspicious activity. With Rasulov's case, the authorities also appear to be trying to discredit his group's human rights work.""""  Responding to concerns about police torture, on Monday a police official who said he was """"personally dealing with [Rasulov's] case"""" said that """"there had been no torture."""" But according to HRSU, police beat one of two other men whom they detained in relation to the Rasulov case. The man was subsequently released.  Another HRSU member from Kashkadaria province, Shovrik Ruzimuradov, died in police custody in July 2001 clearly as a result of torture. Police denied that he had been tortured.  On May 27, Tashkent police broke up a small demonstration at the Ministry of Internal Affairs building protesting Rasulov's arrest. Police dispersed the peaceful protest, detaining Bakhtior Khamraev and Yadgar Turlibekov, as well as Tulkin Kuraev, a Voice of America correspondent and member of HRSU, and Dmitri Aliaev, a BBC correspondent. All four were released between one and two hours later. No charges were pressed. The Uzbek government continues to unlawfully arrest or detain those who meet privately for prayer or Islamic study, who belong to Islamic groups not registered with the government or who possess Islamic literature not generated by the government, singling them out for nothing more than the peaceful expression of their religious beliefs. Local human rights groups estimate that 7,000 independent Muslims are currently in prison in Uzbekistan.  In the past week the government has also cracked down on Uzbekistan's secular political opposition. On May 25, activists from the opposition party Erk were planning to gather in Tashkent. That morning, police detained Otonazar Oripov, a prominent Erk member, and held him until 5:00 p.m., scuttling the planned meeting. Erk lost its registration in 1993. Since then, some of its members have been either jailed or forced into exile.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","Religious Freedom"

In Rome this Tuesday he may be getting an even better deal: a seat at the main decision-making table, with the prospect of many of the rights but none of the responsibilities of NATO membership. Bringing Russia closer to NATO is a necessary part of building a Europe whole and free. But the partnership will make sense only if NATO uses it to address differences with Russia, including over the conduct of its forces in Chechnya, that challenge the alliance's core values and objectives. If NATO does that in a forthright way, holding Russia to the criteria that the alliance expects all its close partners to meet, then it will contribute to positive change in Russia. If the alliance is silent, then it is Russia that will have changed NATO. NATO has based its post-Cold War expansion in part on a commitment to promote democracy and the rule of law. It is """"determined,"""" in the words of its 1999 Washington Declaration, to """"stand firm against those who violate human rights."""" Yet it is elevating to """"equal partnership"""" a country which, despite great democratic strides, is waging a war still characterized by massive violations of human rights. Russia's actions in Chechnya have claimed far more civilian lives than the atrocities that NATO intervened to stop in Kosovo. Russia's failure to distinguish between civilians and combatants in Chechnya has, in the words of the U.S. State Department, """"created an environment favorable"""" to terrorism. It has also taught many thousands of Russian officers and conscripts that killing civilians carries no price. The more joint military and peacekeeping operations NATO and Russia conduct, the more this Russian problem will become NATO's problem as well. A smaller country with similar shortcomings would not have been elevated to such a high status in NATO. Croatia, for example, was not even allowed to join NATO's Partnership for Peace until it started holding accountable the members of its armed forces who were implicated in war crimes. Slovakia's efforts to join NATO were rebuffed while its leaders were harassing political opponents. Putin is gaining influence in the alliance as the last of Russia's independent radio and television stations come under attack. Poland strengthened its case for NATO membership by supporting democracy and the rule of law in Ukraine and Belarus. Russia has been allied with a leader in Belarus whom the United States has accused of using death squads. Of course, Russia is not the Soviet Union. It has made progress in building a democratic, civil society that should put cynics about its destiny to shame. Unconditionally shutting it out would defeat the purpose of NATO's eastward enlargment. NATO would be saying that the community of nations in which democracy and respect for human rights are the norm, so often misnamed """"the West,"""" really does have a fixed eastern frontier, a frontier that starts at Russia's doorstep. But NATO should not become the organization that many Russians have wanted it to become - what Mikhail Gorbachev described a decade ago as a """"common European home,"""" an amorphous institution that includes everyone and imposes obligations on no one. So even as it celebrates the new partnership, NATO should not be afraid to raise the hard issues, repeatedly and directly, with Russian diplomats and soldiers: demanding progress on criminal investigations of military abuses in Chechnya, urging access for international monitors and organizations, making sure that there is no direct alliance cooperation with Russian units and officers implicated in atrocities. NATO should certainly not be afraid to hold Russia to the same democratic standards as, say, Latvia and Bulgaria.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

In letters to NATO and the European Union, which are holding summits with Russia on May 28, Human Rights Watch said that the Russian military's record of abuse in Chechnya undermines the core values and strategic goals of both institutions The NATO summit is expected to create the NATO-Russia Council, which would put Russia on equal footing with other member states on key decisions.  """"Russia now is getting a shot at equal partnership in NATO, even though its armed forces are notorious for human rights violations in Chechnya,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Yet NATO has a commitment to promote rule of law and stand firm against human rights violations.""""  The human rights situation in Chechnya has deteriorated in the past six months. Federal forces continue to detain without charge hundreds of people suspected of involvement in rebel activities. Many are tortured or killed. Some """"disappear""""-authorities deny that detained individuals are in custody. In the early phase of the war, more than 130 people were killed in three massacres that authorities have not properly investigated.  NATO has required states seeking membership to abide by the principles of civilian control of the military and accountability for abuses of the laws of war. Croatia was not allowed to joint NATO's Partnership for Peace program until it started holding accountable members of its armed forces implicated in war crimes. By contrast, Russian authorities have formally opened hundreds of criminal investigations, but for the most part violations of human rights and international humanitarian law remain uninvestigated and unpunished. Moreover, there is credible evidence that the military obstructs some investigations, notably by transferring accused personnel to avoid having them questioned.  In September 2001, Russian authorities said that eleven servicemen had been convicted for crimes committed in Chechnya. Of the eleven, six had either been amnestied or paroled, and five were serving active sentences-one for looting, two for murder, one for attempted murder, and one for mishandling a weapon. By March, military courts had convicted twenty-three military servicemen, although case details are unavailable.  """"If NATO addresses directly the Russian military's abusive methods and the lack of accountability, it can contribute to positive change,"""" said Andersen. """"But if NATO is silent, then it's Russia that will have changed NATO.""""  Human Rights Watch asked the E.U. to speak out strongly about Chechnya at the summit this week. In April, the E.U. sponsored a resolution on Chechnya at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights that condemned abuses and called for U.N. investigations. The commission voted down the resolution, 16-15.  """"This is the first time Russia succeeded in defeating a U.N. resolution on Chechnya,"""" said Andersen. """"The Russian government and people should know that the stand the E.U. took at the commission remains an important element its relationship with Russia."""" Human Rights Watch asked NATO and the E.U. to:  Press for an updated, detailed list of criminal investigations into violations by police, military, and other security forces against noncombatants in Chechnya;  Urge Russia to issue invitations to Chechnya to all relevant U.N. human rights mechanisms, as required by past UNCHR resolutions on Chechnya;  Press for the renewal of the mandate of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe Assistance Group to Chechnya.

According to information Human Rights Watch has received, RCD troops have killed or seized dozens of civilians and others suspected of supporting a breakaway anti-Rwandan faction of the RCD. Many are still unaccounted for. The violence began on May 14. “The RCD and its Rwandan army backers are the de facto authority in Kisangani, and as such must be held responsible for the security of the civilian population there,” said Suliman Baldo, senior researcher on the Democratic Republic of Congo at Human Rights Watch. “The RCD and the Rwandan army garrison in Kisangani must immediately rein in unruly soldiers in their own ranks and hold those responsible for murder accountable.” Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Security Council to order the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Congo to initiate an investigation into the May 14 events and their aftermath, ideally in collaboration with the field office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in Congo. In the early hours of May 14, about a hundred soldiers from within the RCD, calling themselves the RCD-Originale, briefly occupied the official radio and called on Congolese RCD soldiers and city residents to unite and drive the Rwandans out of the country. A mob of about a thousand youths responded, and attacked and killed at least three people whom they identified as Rwandans. RCD soldiers eventually dispersed the mob, killing a handful of people in that incident. RCD loyalists later on the same day went on a rampage in quarters whose residents had demonstrated in support of the mutineers, killing about a dozen people, injuring many more, and pillaging houses and church offices in these populous neighborhoods. Local sources told Human Rights Watch that RCD soldiers rounded up young women from Mangobo quarters and raped them at their barracks. They briefly detained Father Xavier Zabalo, an elderly missionary from the Catholic Parish of Christ Roi, apparently for carrying some of the wounded to a local hospital. They later thoroughly looted the parish compound, and beat another elderly missionary. Top RCD officials have accused Kisangani's highly active human rights groups, church associations, and other civil society organizations of fomenting the trouble, and ordered then to halt their activities. The RCD-controlled radio station continues to air threats aimed at these groups, forcing many human rights and peace activists to go into hiding to evade imminent arrest. In the immediate aftermath of the mutiny, RCD troops seized dozens of suspect RCD military personnel and civilians, many of whom remain unaccounted for since their arrest. On May 17 and 18, bodies were seen floating in the Tshopo river, a tributary of the Congo river, by residents in outlying quarters of the city and, reportedly, by observers of the U.N. peacekeeping mission and the International Committee of the Red Cross stationed there. According to local sources, some of the decomposing corpses had been decapitated, and others had their wrists tied behind their backs. Dozens of Congolese police, soldiers, and civilians were detained following the events of May 14, and the discovery of some of their bodies in the river confirmed the worst fears of relatives that they had been summarily executed. Sources in Kisangani have estimated one hundred killings to date, with at least thirty killings of civilians. The recent violence was the fourth outbreak in as many years between competing rebel factions and the rival occupying armies of Rwanda and Uganda. All of them are vying for control of the strategically important Kisangani, a city of an estimated half a million inhabitants known for its lucrative diamond trade. At least nine hundred civilians were killed and many more were injured in crossfire when the occupying Ugandan and Rwandan armies fought in June 2000 over the control of the city, resulting in the Ugandan’s withdrawal. The fighting destroyed thousands of private homes as well as schools and clinics, prompting the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution demanding the immediate demilitarization of the city by both armies and the Congolese rebel factions they back, and that Rwandan and Uganda pay reparations to Kisangani residents for the losses and injuries they caused. “Kisangani inhabitants were still slowly recovering from the trauma of earlier feuds when they were again assaulted this week,” said Baldo. “If the security of civilians is still a priority, the Security Council must insist that Rwanda and the RCD immediately implement its earlier resolutions on the demilitarization of the city.

Eighty-two juvenile offenders are awaiting execution across the country; twenty-six, including Beazley, are in Texas. Texas and a growing number of other states are having second thoughts about allowing juvenile offenders to be put to death. In the last legislative session, a measure that would have raised the minimum age for capital punishment to eighteen passed in the Texas House of Representatives and would have been approved by the state Senate if Gov. Perry had not threatened to veto it. Indiana abolished the death penalty for juvenile offenders this year. Similar bills are being considered in at least eight other states: Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Elsewhere in the world, only Congo and Iran are known to have executed juvenile offenders in the last three years.

It also cautioned that the latest tensions could lead to additional mine-laying. In a new backgrounder released today, Human Rights Watch said that as part of the military buildup resulting from the December 13, 2001, attack on the Indian parliament, both India and Pakistan have emplaced large numbers of antipersonnel and antivehicle mines along their common border in one of the largest scale mine laying operations anywhere in the world since 1997, when the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty was opened for signature.

Human Rights Watch said the mine-laying is a violation of customary international humanitarian law, because antipersonnel mines are inherently indiscriminate and because their limited military utility is far outweighed by their negative humanitarian consequences.  India openly acknowledges that it is laying mines on its own territory in a possible attempt to mine its entire 1,800-mile (2,897-kilometer) border with Pakistan, at times creating minefields three miles wide (4.8 kilometers).

During the last two months, five students have been killed and dozens arrested as Oromiya state police have violently dispersed peaceful marches by high school students protesting regional governmental policies. Human Rights Watch also called on the Ethiopian government to immediately free all students detained last week in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa during a peaceful rally by Oromo students.  “Shooting at unarmed students is a shameful misuse of government power,” said Saman Zia-Zarifi, Academic Freedom director for Human Rights Watch. “The Ethiopian government has to investigate and prosecute the authorities responsible for firing on the students.”  Last week, police in Addis Ababa arrested nearly 200 students from the different campuses of the national university. Some were released within two days, but others remain incarcerated. According to reports in the local press, the students had staged a peaceful march after the regional government, which is also headquartered in Addis Ababa, denied their requests for a meeting to discuss their concerns about their fellow students in Oromiya.  In March, high school students in several Oromiya towns staged protest marches against the regional government’s educational and land policies. The state authorities declared the protests to be illegal. In the town of Shambu, the police opened fire using live ammunition when students failed to disperse.  The regional government admitted that two students were killed by police gunfire, but the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, the leading monitoring group in the country, said in its report on the clashes that five students were killed and about a dozen were wounded. The regional authorities also detained a number of students and teachers. There were also reports of shootings and injuries in two other towns, Ambo and Nekemte.  Oromiya is the largest and most populous Ethiopian state. Most of its residents are Oromos, Ethiopia’s largest ethnic group. Federal and regional government authorities tend to view all forms of protest of their policies as instigated by the rebel Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), which is leading a decade-long armed struggle for the autonomy of Oromiya.  Both the state government and federal police and the military have a history of repression and abuse, targeted mainly at Oromo intellectuals and community leaders who are viewed as sympathetic to the OLF. Refugees who have fled to neighboring countries in the past decade have told of widespread use of torture and extra-judicial killings in the region.","Africa, Ethiopia","Free Speech"

The violence has been concentrated at the Los Álamos plantation group on Ecuador's southwestern coast, where at least ten striking workers were shot on May 16 by assailants. Los Álamos is owned by the Noboa Corporation, whose owner, Álvaro Noboa, is a leading presidential candidate in Ecuador's October elections.  """"The efforts to stop unions on the banana plantations have been going on for a long time, but now we're seeing a descent into pure thuggery,"""" said Carol Pier, Labor Rights and Trade Researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"The Ecuadorian government has a responsibility to prevent this kind of violence.""""  On April 25, Human Rights Watch released Tainted Harvest: Child Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Ecuador's Banana Plantations, a 114-page report that detailed impediments to unionization and the widespread use of hazardous child labor on Ecuador's banana plantations.  In early March, workers from the Los Álamos plantation group petitioned the Ministry of Labor to recognize their recently-formed union. Shortly thereafter, approximately 124 Los Álamos workers were illegally fired, among them over a dozen union organizers. Although some workers were eventually allowed to resume their posts, others, including the union organizers, are still out of work.  In late April, the Ministry of Labor recognized three trade unions formed by the workers from Los Álamos, a positive step towards respecting workers' right to organize.  According to Ecuadorian workers' organizations, however, three more union activists were reportedly illegally fired on May 2. On May 6, largely in response to the firings, the workers of the Los Álamos plantation group declared a strike. Though a workers' organization allegedly requested police protection for the striking workers, none arrived until violence erupted.  At approximately 2:00 AM on the morning of May 16, between 200 and 400 hooded, armed men entered the Los Álamos plantation group, where workers living on the plantations were sleeping. Reports indicate that the hooded men banged on workers' doors with rifle butts, dragged roughly eighty of them from their homes, hit many with rifle butts, insulted them, looted their homes, and told many that they would be killed and dumped into the river. The hooded men also fired at at least one striking worker, injuring him critically and causing the subsequent amputation of his leg. Approximately six hours later, about six policemen reportedly arrived at the plantations.  """"These actions, the illegal firings and the anti-striker violence, are blatant union-busting tactics and serious human rights abuses,"""" said Pier. """"They must not go unpunished.""""  The armed men remained on the Los Álamos premises throughout the day on May 16 and into the early evening, at which time they allegedly told all striking workers to leave the premises by 6:30 PM or be forcibly evicted. Shortly after 6:00 PM, with the workers showing no sign of leaving, the armed men allegedly began shooting, critically injuring one worker and injuring several others and a policeman. Reports indicate that at 8:00 PM, police reinforcements finally arrived and arrested approximately twenty of the armed thugs.  According to reports, the injured worker whose leg was later amputated needs blood transfusions, which he was allegedly initially denied because his employer failed to make mandatory Social Security payments as required by Ecuadorian law. To ensure that the injured worker received the necessary care, a workers' organization signed as guarantor.  """"This is an example of what happens when you have weak labor laws and even weaker enforcement,"""" said Pier. """"Workers should not be threatened, beaten, or shot for exercising their constitutionally protected and internationally recognized human rights.""""  Human Rights Watch calls on the Ecuadorian government to undertake a comprehensive investigation of these disturbing reports of violence against striking banana workers. Anyone found responsible should be prosecuted. A complete investigation should examine whether these and any other perpetrators were hired by other interested parties, and if proven, those parties should also be brought to justice. The government must enforce its labor laws, which allow striking workers to remain on their employers' premises guarded by police and which state that police must take all necessary measures to guarantee the rights of striking workers and their employers and prevent entry into the workplace by agitators and strike breakers.","Americas, Ecuador","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

The signs of hope are many: over 47,000 combatants have been demobilized; thousands of refugees are returning home; civilians abducted from their villages during rebel attacks are being reunited with their families; the government revenue from Sierra Leone's vast diamond wealth has gone up; and on May 14, Sierra Leoneans went to the polls to elect their president and parliamentarians.   While the election brings much needed peace and security to Sierra Leone, serious human rights issues remain. After a decade of civil war, the state institutions and economy have been destroyed, and a culture of violence, corruption, and impunity has taken root.   The transition period, however, provides a rare opportunity to develop new state institutions with strong human rights components integrated into their structure, and to create mechanisms that can secure respect for human rights throughout the society. In particular, two transitional justice mechanisms - the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission - will play an important role in breaking the cycle of impunity.   In addition to the rebuilding process within the country, it is important to recognize that long-term prospects for peace in Sierra Leone are dependent on developments in the sub region.   As Sierra Leone's brutal conflict comes to an end, violence and insecurity are rapidly escalating in Liberia. War crimes and serious human rights abuses are being committed by both Liberian government forces and rebels from the LURD, including executions, rape, abductions, and looting and burning of villages.   In the face of renewed rebel action, the government of Charles Taylor has become increasingly intolerant of dissent. Since imposing a state of emergency in February, the government has intensified its harassment of civil society groups and the independent media. The government is also remilitarizing the society by remobilizing ex-combatants and allowing the proliferation of militia groups.   The escalating conflict and growing lawlessness in Liberia has the potential to upturn the fragile peace in Sierra Leone. Fighters from all sides are moving across the Sierra Leonean/Liberia border: Hundreds of Sierra Leonean ex-combatants are crossing into Liberia to fight as mercenaries. Liberian government troops and LURD rebel soldiers are crossing into Sierra Leone to loot or escape fighting, and, in a few cases, to abduct people for forced labor. Liberian army deserters are also to be found on the Sierra Leone side of the border, where they could present an additional security threat. LURD forces operating from Sierra Leone are clandestinely recruiting and operating a supply line along the border. There appears to be no consistent policy on the part of either the Sierra Leonean government or the UNAMSIL peacekeepers on how to address this problem.   In view of the close links between the Guinean government and the LURD rebel forces in Liberia, the participation of Guinean troops in UNAMSIL should also give cause for concern. The Guinea contingent of UNAMSIL is currently deployed at the Sierra Leone/Liberia border, raising fears that this area too could become a base of operations for the LURD. At a minimum, these Guinea battalions removed from the border where the likelihood of their involvement in Liberian rebel support or refugee intimidation is higher. Ideally, they should be replaced completely.   The developing crisis in Liberia, if unchecked and unresolved, threatens to erode the fragile peace and stability so painstakingly established in Sierra Leone, and may likely destabilize Guinea and the wider region. This a dire prospect indeed for the people of a region that has already endured so much war, abuse and human suffering for more than a decade.   The Role of the U.N. Security Council   It is imperative therefore that the international community remain engaged in efforts to establish conditions for a sustainable peace, and the protection of human rights, in all three countries in the sub region.   All the Mano River Union governments should be called on to: (1) End cross-border attacks and illicit weapons flows; (2) Cease support for armed rebel activity; (3) Respect the rule of law and human rights; (4) Prevent and punish war crimes and other human rights abuses; and to (5) Create state institutions that are transparent and accountable, particularly in the state security apparatus.   To date, the U.N. Security Council has played an active and important role in attempting to end Liberia's role in the arms-for-diamonds trade in the sub region, through arms embargos and other sanctions. Your involvement has certainly contributed to the emerging peace that we see in Sierra Leone today.   These efforts should continue to be strengthened, including through the creation of better mechanisms to ensure compliance with such sanctions. For example, the illicit flow of arms to Liberia continues. U.N. investigators have documented a network of arms brokers and transport companies in Slovakia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan that arrange illegal weapons purchases. In 1999 and 2000, respectively, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire knowingly provided false cover for arms shipments destined to Liberia. Evidence strongly suggests that a plane that crashed outside Monrovia in February 2002 carried illegal military cargo for the Taylor government. The flight was one of three suspicious flights from Chad, using planes fraudulently registered in Moldova and filing false flight plans. U.N. investigators were blocked from investigating the crash.   Liberia's illicit arms purchases are often financed through payments not accounted for in the budget. For example, income reportedly received by the United States-based Liberian International Shipping and Corporate Registry was twice used to pay for Liberia's arms purchases. Once they refused to engage in the practice, other off-budget outlays of maritime funds were utilized. U.N. investigations also established that, in 1999, a timber company paid for an illegal arms shipment. Human Rights Watch welcomes the U.N. Security Council's recent call for an audit of Liberia's shipping and timber revenue to ensure that the funds are not misused.   We strongly urge you to build on these efforts by adopting a comprehensive sub-regional approach and taking the following steps:  Strengthen mechanisms to ensure compliance with U.N. sanctions; Investigate and end Guinea's support for the Liberian rebels and its destabilization of Liberia;  Take greater steps to monitor and prevent armed cross-border activity along the shared borders between Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. In that regard, mandate the placement of international military observers and human rights monitors along the shared borders of Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Additionally, the Security Council should advocate for the replacement of the Guinean UNAMSIL contingent in Sierra Leone from the border area where the likelihood of their involvement in Liberian rebel support and/or refugee intimidation is higher.","Africa, Liberia, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations"

The report by Human Rights Watch, based in New York, and CLEEN, based in Lagos, documents serious human rights abuses by the """"Bakassi Boys,"""" a vigilante group set up in 1998 to combat armed robbery.   The 45-page report, """"Nigeria: The Bakassi Boys: The Legitimization of Murder and Torture,"""" describes how the Bakassi Boys, active in the south-eastern Nigerian states of Anambra, Abia, and Imo, have been responsible for scores of extrajudicial executions and hundreds of cases of torture and arbitrary detentions. These abuses have been tolerated, and sometimes actively supported and encouraged, by state government authorities. State governments have provided the Bakassi Boys with offices, uniforms and vehicles, as well as paying their salaries. In Anambra State, a law was passed in August 2000 to recognize the group officially as the Anambra State Vigilante Services. In the few cases where members of the Bakassi Boys implicated in crimes have been arrested by the police, they have almost always been released soon afterwards following the intervention of state government officials.   """"Effectively, the Bakassi Boys have taken over the functions of law enforcement agencies in these states, yet they are completely unaccountable,"""" said Carina Tertsakian, Nigeria researcher at Human Rights Watch.   """"By supporting the Bakassi Boys, government authorities are effectively telling the population that it is acceptable to use extreme violence to achieve any ends,"""" said Innocent Chukwuma, executive director of CLEEN.   Initially set up by market traders to fight armed robbery in the large towns of Aba, in Abia State, then in Onitsha, in Anambra State, the Bakassi Boys have used brutal and arbitrary methods, completely bypassing the police and judicial authorities. Openly armed with guns and machetes, they have executed and mutilated their victims in public, and detained and tortured them in illegal detention cells, often with a view to extracting confessions.   In addition to targeting real or suspected criminals, the Bakassi Boys have been deployed to intimidate and sometimes eliminate perceived political opponents of state governments, as well as critics of vigilante violence, and have been called in to settle personal scores.   In several cases documented by Human Rights Watch and CLEEN, there was evidence that the Bakassi Boys took their instructions directly from the state government. In one case, in Anambra State, the Bakassi Boys forced their way into the house of a man they abducted and later killed, announcing """"We are Bakassi Boys. It's a government order."""" In another case, also in Anambra State, a man abducted by the Bakassi Boys was told by one of them: """"The government wants you to die."""" In another case, in Umuahia, Abia State, in July 1999, the Bakassi Boys arrived in a restaurant, claiming they had been sent by the state government to stop criminals; they then proceeded to kill and mutilate two young men who happened to be in the restaurant, attacking them with machetes and guns, then setting them on fire.   """"There was no evidence that these or many other of their victims had been involved in any criminal activity,"""" said Tertsakian. """"But even those who are guilty have a basic right to due process. Such rights are systematically disregarded whenever the Bakassi Boys are involved.""""   Human Rights Watch and CLEEN spoke to many victims and relatives of victims of vigilante violence in southeastern Nigeria. The report documents several cases in detail, including the killing of Prophet Eddie Okeke, who was abducted from his home in Nawgu and tortured and killed by the Bakassi Boys in Onitsha, Anambra State, in November 2000; the killing of Chief Ezeodumegwu G.Okonkwo, abducted from his home in Nnewi and killed in Onitsha in February 2001; the abduction and torture of Ifeanyi Ibegbu, minority leader in the Anambra State house of assembly, in Onitsha in August 2001; and the abduction and torture of Bishop Alex Ezeugo Ekewuba, founder of the Overcomers Church in Owerri, Imo State, in June 2001.

""""The majority of those killed are young men and boys, from poor backgrounds. Their deaths have gone almost unreported.""""   Human Rights Watch and CLEEN make a number of recommendations to the Nigerian Government, including:  Repeal laws which endorse the activities of the Bakassi Boys or similar vigilante groups; Disarm and disband the Bakassi Boys and close down all their detention centers; Investigate all cases of unlawful detention, torture, and extrajudicial killings by the Bakassi Boys or other vigilante groups and ensure that those responsible are brought to justice, including those who carried out the abuses and those who ordered them; and Devote urgent attention to reforming and improving the national police force and enabling it to carry out its duties effectively","Africa, Nigeria",""

The State Department argues that """"rapid restoration of order will reduce tensions and weaken extremist groups, thus serving counter-terrorism goals in Indonesia and beyond."""" The funding request is buried in a special foreign aid bill due to be voted on as early as today. How would such a force function? Would it promote military reform?

Christian churches and homes were burned, civilian deaths mounted and gunmen carrying M-16s raised suspicions that Indonesian soldiers were involved. The roots of the conflict in Maluku are complex, including political rivalries and economic tensions and charges of provocation by outside groups. The U.S. suspects that Laskar Jihad has links to Al Qaeda, but the causes of the violence are clearly domestic. The Indonesian security forces have been slow to respond to the violence. The problem is not a lack of training and equipment; it's a lack of political will and the highly political role of the army. None of the diplomats, business people or nongovernmental organizations I spoke with in Jakarta could imagine how a U.S.-trained force--outfitted with M-16s, helicopters, crowd control equipment and other hardware--would work in a hot spot such as Maluku or in Aceh, site of a secessionist war. Above all, there is little faith in Indonesia's weak civilian institutions to exercise the kind of control needed to prevent a peacekeeping unit from becoming another abusive force like the army's special forces or the mobile police brigades. So why is the U.S. promoting this idea? For months, senior Bush administration officials have urged President Megawati Sukarnoputri to crack down on suspected terrorist links. The latest initiative, combined with a second $8-million funding request to set up a counter-terrorism unit, is part of the same strategy. The Pentagon is eager to reestablish relations with its Indonesian counterpart. Military cooperation with Indonesia was restricted by the Clinton administration after a rampage by army-sponsored militias in East Timor in 1999. Bush has lifted many restrictions, resuming high-level military contacts and commercial sales of nonlethal arms. However, Congress made specific training programs and arms sales conditional in last year's foreign aid bill, requiring steps toward greater accountability for human rights abuses and civilian control of the military. The counter-terrorism agenda is being used as an excuse for subverting these conditions. U.S. support for changing the role of the military is critical for the country's long-term democratic transition, but aid should be given only when it contributes to reform. This includes removing impunity for military personnel, putting security forces under effective civilian control and ending their shadowy role supporting militia groups and stimulating local and regional conflicts. There is no quick fix in dealing with terrorism in Southeast Asia. A U.S.-funded """"peacekeeping force"""" would send the wrong signal to those promoting basic reform and, worse, there is little prospect it would help keep the peace.

Human Rights Watch sent a letter urging Yugoslav Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic to turn over files to the war crimes tribunal as Yugoslav leaders visited Washington, D.C. to press for aid money.    Svilanovic, together with Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, is visiting Washington to encourage the U.S. government to resume aid to Yugoslavia, cut off since March 31 over Belgrade's failure to cooperate with the Hague court. Human Rights Watch said that Yugoslavia's ongoing failure to grant access to the archives and files essential to ICTY prosecutions made resumption of U.S. economic assistance premature. Svilanovic and Djindjic are scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on May 21.     """"While we welcome the voluntary surrenders of recent high-level indictees, the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities have stonewalled access to the official archives necessary for full and fair adjudication,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"From the dock in The Hague Slobodan Milosevic has had greater access to security files than the Tribunal. This has to change before U.S. aid starts to flow again.""""     In November 2001, Congress adopted a provision that required the arrest and transfer of indictees and access to files and witnesses as preconditions for continuing aid. On March 31, U.S. economic aid to Belgrade ended because Yugoslav authorities had failed to take meaningful steps to cooperate with the ICTY as required by the U.S. law. The Bush Administration refused to certify progress in Belgrade's cooperation.     Foreign Minister Svilanovic and Serbian Prime Minister Djindjic are in Washington to make the case that enough cooperation has occurred to justify the resumption of economic assistance. They are asking U.S. officials to unfreeze the assets of Yugoslav banks held in the United States, grant Yugoslavia trade privileges and endorse the country in its negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors to whom Yugoslavia owes massive debt.     Over the 18 months that Slobodan Milosevic has been out of power the Tribunal has been given no access to the key archives. These are archives protected by the Yugoslav Army; the Yugoslav Ministry of the Interior; the Serbian Ministry of Interior, including the State Security; the Yugoslav Presidency; the Yugoslav Cabinet; the Yugoslav Defense Ministry; the Serbian Presidency; and the Serbian Cabinet.     Human Rights Watch said tribunal investigators need information about the way the Yugoslav and Serbian government archives are organized, as well as access. """"These are massive archives and mere access would leave the investigators looking for a needle in a haystack,"""" Andersen explained. """"The Bush administration has been pressing the ICTY to complete its investigations and trials in a timely and efficient manner. To do so, the investigators need a roadmap to the files and help finding the relevant documents.""""     In April, Yugoslavia enacted a law authorizing cooperation with the ICTY. Foreign Minister Goran Svilanovic heads a newly established National Council on Cooperation with the ICTY mandated to oversee and facilitate cooperation. In the few weeks since the enactment of the law several high level former officials have voluntarily surrendered to the authority of the Tribunal.     Nonetheless, Radovan Karadzic, former President of the Bosnian Serb Republic and Ratko Mladic, the commander of the Bosnian Serb military, two senior ICTY indictees, remain at liberty. Mladic is believed to be in Yugoslavia, while Karadzic has been reportedly in hiding in Bosnia.     In recent letters to Yugoslav President Kostunica and Prime Minister Djindjic, Human Rights Watch has argued that their governments must cooperate with the Tribunal on access to documents as well as the arrest and transfer of indictees in order to distance themselves from the Milosevic legacy and build a new future in Europe.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

We welcome several recent important developments toward greater cooperation with the ICTY, including the passage of a law by the Federal Parliament and the surrender of several senior indictees to The Hague. With the law in place we look forward to the early apprehension of those indictees who have not voluntarily surrendered to the Tribunal, and their swift transfer to The Hague.   At the same time, we remain particularly concerned about your government's failure to provide ICTY investigators access to archives and files. We believe this failure seriously undermines the other positive steps on cooperation the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) has taken. We urge you to ensure the Tribunal's necessary access to documents.   Human Rights Watch is an international privately funded non-governmental organization that is committed to documenting and curbing human rights abuses. We have devoted a significant amount of time to researching and recording violations of international human rights and humanitarian law on all sides of the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the NATO war in the former Yugoslavia. We advocate individual accountability for those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity, as an important antidote to the unjust sense of collective responsibility that unfortunately exists in the region.   In light of the severity of the abuses and the long-standing inability or unwillingness of any of the governments in the region to hold those responsible accountable, it has been our view that the trials at the Tribunal offer the best chance for the people of the region to obtain an impartial adjudication of the alleged crimes. The Tribunal of course has its flaws, but as close and impartial observers, we have concluded that the ICTY guarantees a fair trial to all sides: rights are guaranteed to the accused, witnesses and the accused have equal opportunities to speak and question, and the prosecution impartially weighs the evidence.   However, the prosecution cannot guarantee thorough and fair adjudication unless it has access to all relevant documents, which only your government can provide. We are deeply disturbed by reports the FRY has ignored numerous ICTY requests for materials.   We have noted Federal Interior Minister Zoran Zivkovic's and Serbian Interior Minister Dusan Mihajlovic's recent statements that FRY and Serbia will provide access to some, but not all, of this material. Mr. Zivkovic has alluded to certain documents that will remain sealed for up to thirty years. He said documents that may threaten national security interests would be withheld, but he made no mention of the Tribunal's procedure for dealing with such items.   The Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence outline the steps for document production when a state has reason to believe certain evidence may threaten national security interests. Rule 54 bis authorizes the state to object to the request. The state can then ask for various protective measures, including an ex parte hearing and submission of documents in redacted form. The Tribunal can also authorize a single judge to examine the documents and allow the state to provide its own interpreters and translators. Of course, the Tribunal can also decide in favor of the state's objection and deny the prosecution's request for the document altogether. These important safeguards should assure the FRY and Serbian governments that providing the Tribunal with access to crucial archives will not pose a threat to genuine national security interests. National security cannot therefore provide a basis for your government's continued failure to abide by its international obligation to provide the ICTY with access to relevant government archives.   We urge you as Chairman of the National Council on Cooperation with the ICTY to take immediate steps to provide necessary access to archives and files, including those protected by the Yugoslav Army; the Yugoslav Ministry of the Interior; the Serbian Ministry of Interior, including the State Security; the Yugoslav Presidency; the Yugoslav Cabinet; the Yugoslav Defense Ministry; the Serbian Presidency; and the Serbian Cabinet.   In addition, the large scope of potentially relevant materials, we believe it is essential for the FRY to furnish an explanation of the classification system of the relevant archives. We urge you to provide the organizational charts and indices of these archives to Tribunal investigators and to make senior archivists available to them. This will enable the ICTY to determine which archives are actually relevant and save time and the unnecessary expenditure of resources.   The current obstacles to prosecutorial review of the archives have left Slobodan Milosevic and his associates in Belgrade with greater access to official files than the Office of the Prosecutor.  We urge you to take the necessary steps to change this situation in order to assure the fairest trial possible. At stake is Yugoslavia's economic and political integration into Europe, as well as the credibility of your government's commitment to uphold the principles of human rights and the rule of law in post-Milosevic Yugoslavia.

The amnesty bill, which was introduced in Congress yesterday, would bar the criminal prosecution of the more than 100 commandos who participated in the April 1997 raid. Evidence suggests that eight of the fourteen guerrillas killed during the rescue operation were summarily executed.  """"The successful rescue of the hostages turned these commandos into national heroes, but the evidence of illegal killings is compelling,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"National gratitude is no reason for shielding them from justice.""""  In a dramatic and carefully planned raid, the commandos rescued seventy-one hostages being held by guerrillas of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru, MRTA), after a four-month siege of the Japanese Ambassador's residence in Lima. According to the official version of the events, all fourteen of the guerrillas were shot dead in a gun battle. At the time, a photograph was widely published of then-President Alberto Fujimori standing on a staircase strewn with the bodies of slain guerrillas.  Recent forensic investigations, however, have established that eight of the guerrillas were apparently shot in the head after capture or while defenseless because of injuries. A Japanese former hostage declared that he saw one of the guerrillas, Eduardo Cruz Sánchez, alive and in custody after the raid. Forensic examination revealed that Cruz died from a single bullet to the back of the neck.  Two amnesty proposals are now under discussion in congressional committees, one submitted by the Popular American Revolutionary Alliance party (Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana, APRA) of former presidential candidate Alan García, the other by the National Unity party (Unidad Nacional, UN). The UN bill """"grants amnesty"""" to army Gen. José Williams Zapata, who headed up the operation, and to the """"official personnel who participated in the freeing and rescue of the hostages.""""  The amnesty proposals were prompted by judicial warrants for the arrest of ten senior army officers who participated in the raid, issued by judge Cecilia Polack Boluarte on May 13. The warrants allow the accused to be held for fifteen days before formal charges are filed. Peru's ministers of defense, justice and the interior have all criticized the arrest orders.  The amnesty proposals clearly conflict with the principles enunciated by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in March 2001, ruling against the Peruvian government in the case of the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre. In that case, which involved the amnesty law passed in 1995 by the Fujimori government, the Court declared the amnesty null and void because it conflicted with Peru's human rights treaty obligations. It later interpreted that ruling as applicable to all similar cases.  Besides the proposed amnesty law, the Peruvian Congress issued a declaration yesterday expressing concern at the arrest warrants against the officers involved in the rescue operation. The warrants have also been criticized by the human rights ombudsman, in a rare public disagreement with the position taken by Peru's nongovernmental human rights organizations.  """"Peru's opinion leaders clearly feel differently about this case than about other human rights violations committed during the Fujimori government that are currently under investigation in the courts,"""" said Vivanco. """"But the principle is exactly the same. If the accused want to challenge the grounds of their arrest they should do so in court, and only the courts should determine whether there are charges to answer to.""""","Americas, Peru","International Justice"

More than fifty NGOs from twenty-four of the EBRD's shareholder countries sent the letter as the EBRD prepares for this year's annual meeting, which opens on May 19 in Bucharest. The letter calls for the Bank to press the Uzbek government for meaningful improvements in human rights in the year-long lead-up to the 2003 event.  The EBRD's founding agreement embraces """"fundamental principles of multiparty democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and market economics.""""  """"Uzbekistan does not deserve the prestige attached to hosting such a meeting,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Uzbek government has a terrible human rights record, and Tashkent is a terrible symbol for the Bank's principles.""""  In the decade since joining the EBRD, Uzbekistan's transition from communism has produced a government profoundly hostile to human rights. Opposition political parties are banned, and their activists and leaders are exiled, jailed, harassed, or beaten.  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe refused to send observers to the 1999 parliamentary elections because they were neither free nor fair. The sole candidate in the 2000 presidential elections permitted to contest the vote was a public supporter of the president's policies and leadership, and was quoted during the campaign as stating that he intended to vote for the incumbent, President Islam Karimov. On January 27 this year, while hosting a high-level delegation of U.S. officials visiting Tashkent, President Karimov had his term in office extended until 2007 through a referendum that once again made a mockery of the country's democratic process.  The government has harassed and jailed thousands of Muslims for practicing their faith outside state controls, or for their affiliation with unregistered Islamic organizations. Human Rights Watch has documented more than 800 such cases since 1999. The accused are often held in secret detention, tortured, and denied access to counsel.  Torture is rampant throughout the Uzbek criminal justice system. In the past year alone, at least seven people have died in custody allegedly due to torture.  The government keeps tight control over all media and other forms of expression. In recent years, it has harassed and imprisoned several human rights advocates and political dissidents. Civic organizations cannot exist genuinely independent of the government. In March 2002, after five years of repeated requests, the government registered the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan, but other groups continue to await registration.  """"Holding such a high-level gathering in Tashkent without requiring anything in exchange will send the wrong message to the Uzbek leadership, which will be able to flag it as an endorsement of its repressive policies. The Bank must use this opportunity to seek meaningful reforms from the Uzbek government,"""" said Andersen.  The nongovernmental organizations called on the EBRD to set concrete benchmarks for the Uzbek government to fulfill prior to the 2003 annual meeting. They include:  The registration and unfettered operation of opposition parties, human rights and other civil society groups;  Genuine legal reform, including the introduction of judicial review of detentions;  Access to United Nations human rights monitors, in particular the Special Rapporteur on Torture, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and the Special Representative to the Secretary General on Human Rights Defenders;  National elections that are considered free and fair by domestic and international observers;  The functioning of a free media; and  An end to the persecution of independent Muslims, their families and those who advocate on their behalf.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Describing the embargo as a failed policy, Human Rights Watch said that it imposes indiscriminate hardship on the Cuban people and impedes democratic change. On Monday, President Bush will reportedly give a speech reaffirming his administration's support of the embargo. In its current form, the embargo bars nearly all U.S. trade with Cuba, and prohibits U.S. citizens from visiting the island unless they can show that they fall into certain narrow categories.  """"If the goal is to improve human rights conditions in Cuba, then the embargo should be ended,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The embargo has proved itself ineffective and even counterproductive to the human rights cause.""""  Human Rights Watch recommended that after ending the embargo the U.S. government should adopt a more calibrated policy, one that would respond to incremental changes in the Cuban government's human rights practices. """"The embargo is a sledgehammer,"""" said Vivanco. """"Washington needs a smarter approach.""""  Human Rights Watch pointed out several serious flaws in the more than forty-year-old policy. First, it is an all-or-nothing approach aimed at overthrowing the Castro government, which does not allow for any relaxation in response to measurable improvement in Cuban human rights practices. It therefore does nothing to encourage such improvements, instead providing the Cuban authorities with a convenient justification for their repressive policies.  Second, the embargo is indiscriminate, hurting the Cuban population as a whole. By eliciting a nationalistic response from Cubans, it helps the government shift blame for the country's problems. Third, the embargo alienates Washington's potential allies in the effort to bring about change in Cuba. For the past ten years, it has been condemned in the General Assembly of the United Nations by an overwhelming margin. Resentment of the embargo dissuades other governments from being more vocal about Cuba's poor human rights conditions.  Finally, the embargo's travel ban, which only contains narrow exceptions for journalists, people with relatives in Cuba, and certain other groups, violates the rights of U.S. citizens by limiting their ability to share information and ideas with Cubans. As the visit of former President Jimmy Carter exemplified, U.S. visitors may be the emissary of democratic values and ideas, enriching Cuba's relatively closed society.","Americas, United States, Cuba",""

My name is Binaifer Nowrojee. I serve as counsel with Human Rights Watch's Africa Division I have been with the organization since 1993. Prior to that, I served as staff attorney on Africa for the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights from 1989 to 1992. I have been involved in human rights research and advocacy on West Africa since 1989.   After ten years characterized by unspeakable brutality and widespread human rights abuses against civilians, the devastating civil war in Sierra Leone between government forces and the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) appears to be over. Human rights abuses in Sierra Leone have significantly decreased following the deployment of 17,000 United Nations (U.N.) peacekeepers.   The May 14, 2002 elections are a significant milestone, and the signs of hope are many: over 47,000 combatants have been disarmed and demobilized; hundreds of thousands of refugees are returning home; civilians abducted from their villages during rebel attacks are being reunited with their families; the government revenue from Sierra Leone's vast diamond wealth has gone up; and on May 14, Sierra Leoneans went to the polls to elect their president and parliamentarians.   While Human Rights Watch is encouraged by Sierra Leone's progress, its long-term prospects for peace are dependent on continued attention, not only to the rebuilding process within Sierra Leone, but also to developments in the sub region. As Sierra Leone's brutal conflict comes to an end, violence and insecurity are rapidly escalating in Liberia. At this time, Guinea is playing a destabilizing role in providing support to the Liberian rebels. The renewal of war in Liberia poses a real threat to sustainable peace and security, not only to Liberia, but also to Sierra Leone and Guinea.  Human Rights Concerns in Sierra Leone  Within Sierra Leone, the peace remains fragile. The new government is beginning the process of establishing and consolidating its authority in the face of enormous challenges. The transition period, however, provides a rare opportunity to develop new state institutions with strong human rights components integrated into their structure, and to create me chanisms that can secure and enforce respect for human rights throughout the society.   The deep-rooted issues that gave rise to the civil war-a culture of impunity, endemic corruption, weak rule of law, and the inequitable distribution of the country's vast natural resources-remain largely unaddressed. For decades, the majority of Sierra Leoneans have been betrayed by the state institutions responsible for representing and protecting them; embezzlement and abuse of authority resulted in the near collapse of most government institutions; the army and police intimidated, extorted money from, and sometimes colluded with the rebels; and the judicial system was largely subject to political manipulation and bribe taking, leaving justice unattainable for most.   Unless there is significant reform to Sierra Leone's justice and law enforcement institutions, combined with a committed effort to address the root causes of the war, the recent signs of hope will likely, and sadly, be short-lived. Human Rights Watch believes the following three issues should be among the priorities:   (1) Accountability for Past Abuses   In order to have a future built on respect for human rights and justice, accountability for the horrific atrocities, which have characterized the war, is of paramount importance. Those accused of war crimes also have a right to a fair and speedy trial. Former rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and Westside Boys continue to be detained without due process guarantees.   During the war, the overwhelming majority of abuses were committed by RUF rebels and former Sierra Leonean Army soldiers (from the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council and later West Side Boys). These abuses included the summary execution of civilians; amputation of limbs; widespread abduction of thousands of civilians who were later recruited as fighters and used for forced labor; the widespread sexual violence against women and girls including individual and gang rape, sexual assault with objects such as firewood, umbrellas and sticks, and sexual slavery; the use of civilians as human shields; and the wanton destruction of property. However, serious abuses were also committed by the government-allied civil defense forces militias, including the systematic use of child combatants and the torture and execution of prisoners, and soldiers from the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG (Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Cease-fire Monitoring Group), including the summary execution of suspected rebels and their collaborators.   Two important international justice mechanisms can play an important role in this regard. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, a groundbreaking U.N. effort that combines international and domestic mechanisms and laws, is charged with bringing to justice key leaders responsible for war crimes, crimes against humanity, serious violations of international humanitarian law, as well as certain violations of Sierra Leonean law committed since November 1996. The court is envisioned to try some twenty to thirty of those from all warring factions who have both direct and indirect command responsibility for the most serious abuses and violations. Once constituted, the special court is to be operational for at least three years. In April 2002, the chief prosecutor and the registrar were appointed, and the Special Court is expected to bring its first indictments by the end of 2002. Human Rights Watch believes the Special Court can play an important role not only within Sierra Leone, but also to address the involvement of regional players, such as Liberian president Charles Taylor, in providing logistic, financial, and military support to the RUF.   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), mandated under the 1999 Lomé Peace Accord, seeks to establish an impartial historical record of the conflict, promote reconciliation and healing, and make preventative recommendations for the future. The TRC will give victims and perpetrators a forum to address the horrors of the war. Once constituted, the seven TRC commissioners, three international and four Sierra Leoneans, will determine the commission's format. The TRC will operate for one year, after a three- month preparatory phase, with the possibility of a six-month extension.   Despite considerable efforts to establish the TRC-spearheaded by UNAMSIL and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights-it has yet to commence operations due in part to serious funding shortfalls and bureaucratic delays within the U.N. In order to be most effective, it should not ignore the conditions that gave rise to the war and give equal attention to abuses committed by all sides of the war, including the collusion between the national army and rebel forces; the clandestine business dealings between rebel forces and businessmen, elected representatives, government officials and peacekeeping forces. Additionally, it should examine the involvement of regional players who provided logistical, financial and military support to rebel groups.   (2) Rebuilding the Judiciary and Law Reform   The government must, as a matter of priority, create a justice and law enforcement system that promotes the rule of law and respects human rights. The Ministry of Justice, the courts, the law enforcement agencies, and the prison administration are all institutions that must be developed to guarantee official accountability.   In order to establish the rule of law, it is imperative that the national judicial system, which has all but collapsed, be strengthened. While there were serious problems with the judicial and legal systems before the conflict, the ten-year war has clearly exacerbated them. At present, the law courts are only functional in the capital and two other provincial towns. There is an insufficient number of judges, magistrates, prosecutors and courtrooms, which has led to huge backlogs, and the prolonged unlawful detention of hundreds. Corruption within the legal system is endemic, and scores of cases, many involving key politicians, are being blocked or protected from further investigation or prosecution. Additionally, legal reform efforts are needed to change antiquated discriminatory laws that do not meet international human rights standards.   The local, or tribal courts, and the often-discriminatory customary law on which they are based, must also be reviewed, revised and properly regulated. An estimated seventy percent of the population relies on customary, or tribal law, which is adjudicated through the local courts. These local courts are often discriminatory, particularly to women, and frequently abuse their powers by illegally detaining persons or charging excessively high fines for minor offences.   Now that the government's ability to generate state revenue has improved, it must show a commitment to the rule of law by providing adequate resources to the judiciary for the hiring and training of quality personnel. The international community should also increase funding and provide technical support to human rights groups providing legal aid services to the indigent.   The United Kingdom (U.K.) has since 1998 made a significant commitment to the Sierra Leone legal system through their Law Development Project, which seeks to restore and strengthen the legal institution and update the legal code in Sierra Leone. Human Rights Watch commends this effort and hopes other donors will follow suit.   (3) Training and Monitoring of the Army and Police  The national Sierra Leone army and police have over the years been the source of considerable instability, corruption and indeed suffering. From extortion at military and police checkpoints, to rape of women in police custody, to high-level army collusion with rebel forces, to the execution of alleged rebels and collaborators, their acts have enjoyed near immunity from prosecution. Their history of serious and systematic human rights abuses, particularly by the then Sierra Leonean soldiers who in 1997 formed part of the Armed Forces Revolutionary Party and later West Side Boys, is well documented.   Since 1999, the British-led International Military Advisory and Training Team (IMATT) has endeavored to reform, restructure and rehabilitate the army, now called the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces (RSLAF). Some 14,000 Sierra Leonean soldiers, many former rebels, have now been retrained and are currently deployed countrywide. Some 130, mostly British, Canadian, and Australian officers are, and will for years to come, be embedded into key decision making positions within the Ministry of Defense, military headquarters and battalions and brigades country-wide.   The hands on approach and tight supervision of the newly trained army appears to be rendering results; human rights monitors have received very few reports of indiscipline and blatant abuses against civilians. A few high- level officers and several lower level officers have, in fact, been suspended from their positions for corruption and mismanagement, something that would never have happened in years past.   However, since 1999, the army has been unable to hold court martial boards and try their own cases. In 2001, British advisors and Sierra Leonean officers rewrote the Rules of Procedure and Standing Regulations for Court Martial Boards so as to bring them up to international standards. The new regulations were in October 2001 submitted to the office of the Minister of Justice for approval. However, they have yet to be approved, and as a result no court martial can take place. There are currently eight military personne l, including two officers, who have cases pending. If corruption, indiscipline and impunity within the military are to be addressed, these regulations must be passed and cases involving the RSLAF must begin to be adjudicated.   Since 1998, the Commonwealth secretariat, largely funded by the U.K. government's Department for International Development (DFID), has led a significant effort to restructure and retrain the beleaguered Sierra Leone Police (SLP), including the secondment of a British Inspector General. For decades the SLP was used as a repressive arm of the one party state, and their institutionalized corruption led to considerable mistrust, fear and disrespect. The focus of the current training effort, called the Commonwealth Police Development Task Force (CPDTF), has been on ending political interference of the police, and addressing problems with senior police management, which was saturated with deeply corrupt and unprofessional officers. However, the three full- time staff and nine part-time CPDTF consultants, who are largely Freetown based, are unable to provide sorely needed ‘hands-on' supervision and mentoring on the basic building blocks of policing. The CPDTF has, however, set up an internal investigation unit to look into complaints of corruption, mismanagement and unprofessionalism, and has commendably dismissed many, and indeed prosecuted several, police officers for corrupt practices. They have also made an effort to establish special units to respond to domestic and sexual violence.   Human Rights Watch continues to receive frequent complaints of corrupt, unprofessional and in some cases abusive practices by police, including the taking of bribes at checkpoints or to investigate complaints; inability to conduct proper criminal investigations; intimidation of local businessmen; impounding of vehicles and fabrication of claims for the purposes of extortion; and encouraging out of court settlements between perpetrators and victims.   While the task of rehabilitating the police force is eno rmous, and the CPDTF has made significant strides, Human Rights Watch believes the current training approach-which at British pounds 12 million [approximately U.S. $18 million] for three years is very expensive-is failing to provide the back to basics training and day to day supervision needed to transform the police into a truly professional force. We therefore urge the international community to revisit the current training model and adopt one that provides for the imbedding of supervisors and trainers into all levels of the police force.  Regional Aspects to Peace and Stability in Sierra Leone  Prospects for sustainable peace in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea remain tenuous as the intertwined conflicts continue to spill over the borders, offsetting gains that are made in each country to restore calm. As Sierra Leone's brutal conflict comes to an end, violence and insecurity are rapidly escalating in Liberia. At this time, Guinea is playing a destabilizing role in providing support to the Liberian rebels   The conflicts of the Mano River Union countries, encompassing Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, have shown a ready potential to overflow and destabilize each other. A long-standing web of shifting military and political alliances exists among the three governments and the various armed opposition groups. Accountability for serious abuses is practically nonexistent, and military impunity in all three countries remains a serious problem. The area is also awash with hundreds of ex-combatants willing to cross over to any side as mercenaries.  The Liberian Conflict and the Impact on Sierra Leone  Charles Taylor, both as leader of the former Liberian rebel group known as the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) and as president of Liberia since 1997, bears primary responsibility for much of the long-standing aggression and violence in Liberia and the sub-region. For years, Taylor helped fuel the Sierra Leonean conflict through his arming and support of the RUF rebels, as well as facilitation of illegal diamond exports from rebel-controlled areas. In return, when Taylor's government came under armed attack from Liberian dissidents in 1999, 2000 and 2001, RUF forces assisted in expelling them from Liberia.   Only five years after Liberia began a shaky transition to peace, the country is once against immersed in war. Since June 2000, fighters from the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) have launched repeated hit-and-run attacks moving steadily towards the capital Monrovia.   Both Liberian government forces and LURD are responsible for committing war crimes and other serious human rights abuses against civilians, including summary executions of civilians, rape of girls and women, abduction, and looting and burning of villages. In the face of renewed rebel action, the Taylor government has become increasingly intolerant of dissent and, since the imposition of a state of emergency in February 2002, has intensified its harassment and intimidation of the independent press, civil society groups, and legitimate political opposition groups who have been imprisoned, harassed, beaten and in a few cases, killed.   Despite being subject to an arms embargo continuously since 1992, the Taylor government continues to procure weapons. In some cases, the weapons were forwarded to RUF rebels in Sierra Leone, breaking a second embargo. U.N. investigators have documented a network of arms brokers and transport companies that provided false documents and relied on lax controls in Slovakia, Moldova, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan to arrange illegal weapons purchases. In 1999 and 2000, respectively, Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire knowingly provided false cover for arms shipments destined to Liberia. The illicit flow of arms to Liberia continues. Evidence strongly suggests that a plane that crashed outside Monrovia in February 2002 carried an illegal military cargo for the Taylor government. The flight was one of three suspicious flights from Chad, using planes fraudulently registered in Moldova and filing false flight plans. U.N. investigators were blocked from investigating the crash.   Liberia's illicit arms purchases are often financed through off-budget spending, or payments not accounted for in the budget. For example, income received by the United States-based Liberian International Shipping and Corporate Registry (LISCR) was twice used to pay for Liberia's arms purchases. After LISCR refused to engage in the practice, as of August 2000, other off-budget outlays of maritime funds were utilized. U.N. investigations also established that in 1999 a timber company paid for an illegal arms shipment. In an important move, the U.N. Security Council recently ordered Liberia to audit its shipping and timber revenue to ensure that the funds are no longer misused.   The escalating conflict and growing lawlessness in Liberia has the potential to upturn the fragile peace in Sierra Leone. A growing number of Liberian refugees and combatants are crossing the Sierra Leone border, and the area threatens to become unstable once again. Hundreds of excombatants from Sierra Leone, who may later pose a threat to Sierra Leone, have crossed into Liberia to fight as mercenaries either for the Liberian government or for the LURD. Since 2001, LURD forces operating from Sierra Leone have been clandestinely recruiting and operating a supply line along the Sierra Leone/Liberia border. Liberian government troops and LURD rebel soldiers often cross from Liberia into Sierra Leone for the purpose of looting, to sell on looted goods, to buy provisions, to escape fighting, and, in a few cases, to abduct people who are then forced to work as porters for them. Liberian army deserters are also to be found on the Sierra Leone side of the border, where they could present an additional security threat. There appears to be no consistent policy on the part of either the Sierra Leonean government or the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, on how to address this problem.   There is an urgent need for border security to be strengthened, including screening to ensure that combatants are clearly distinguished and separated from civilians seeking refugee protection in Sierra Leone. The Sierra Leonean government needs to establish an adequate police presence along the border areas, and to establish a status determination body to screen combatants from refugees. Additionally, there is a need for improved policing to ensure that refugees are adequately protected and to guarantee the civilian nature of all refugee camps. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees should ensure as a priority the civilian nature of the refugee camps, increase the number of international protection staff, and work closely with neighboring host governments to establish screening mechanisms at the border to separate Liberian combatants from refugees.  The Role of Guinea in Destabilizing Liberia  At this time, the government of Guinea is playing a destabilizing role in providing considerable logistical and some military support to the Liberian rebels that operate from Guinea. Evidence indicates that this support is being given with the knowledge and support of high-ranking Guinean officials, including the president.   Domestically, President Lansana Conté remains largely intolerant of opposition and turns a blind eye to frequent abuses by his security forces. A November 2001 constitutional referendum that removed a two-term limit on the presidency, and virtually ensures him of lifetime rule, is widely believed to have been manipulated in his favor.   Guinea's support to the LURD intensified after the Liberian government, assisted by Sierra Leonean rebel fighters and Guinean dissidents, launched a series of cross-border attacks into Guinea in late 2000 and early 2001. They attacked towns and refugees camps containing Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees, causing thousands to become further displaced and killing and wounding hundreds of refugees and Guinean civilians. These Liberian- led incursions into Guinea were opposed by Guinean government forces, backed by members of Sierra Leonean civil defense force militias and Guinea-based LURD fighters. They pushed back the Liberian and RUF forces, and the Guinean army also carried out helicopter, artillery and ground attacks into RUF-held areas of northern Sierra Leone, killing scores of civilians and burning villages.   In view of the close links between the Guinean government and the LURD rebel forces in Liberia, the participation of Guinean troops in the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, UNAMSIL, should give cause for concern. The Guinean contingent of UNAMSIL is currently deployed in Sierra Leone's Pujehun District, which borders Liberia, raising fears that this area too could become a base of operations for the LURD, enabling them to strike into Liberia from two directions. Human Rights Watch recommends the replacement of the Guinean forces in the UNAMSIL operation in Sierra Leone with non-West African troops that are not implicated in the sub-regional conflict. At a minimum, the Guinea battalions should be removed from Pujehun District, and not be deployed near the Sierra Leone/Liberia border where the likelihood of their involvement in Liberian rebel support and/or refugee intimidation is higher.  United States Policy  For the past few years, United States (U.S.) policy on Sierra Leone has concentrated on ending Liberian government support for the RUF, supporting the U.K. military actions in Sierra Leone, and providing humanitarian assistance. Additionally, the U.S. pledge of U.S. $15 million over three years to the proposed Special Court for Sierra Leone was the largest of any contributing nation. The U.S. total humanitarian and emergency contribution in FY 2001, including grants to aid and refugee agencies, through USAID for food relief, assistance to refugees, and development programs was U.S. $75 million.   U.S. pressure on the Liberian government to address human rights abuses has commendably been strong and consistent. Relations between the U.S. and Liberia deteriorated as President Taylor's role in fueling the war in Sierra Leone became more evident. In accordance with the U.N. sanctions imposed in May 2001, the U.S. prohibited the importation of Liberian rough diamonds. The Bush administration continued the Clinton policy of isolating Taylor politically and diplomatically, although less publicly. Administration officials have stressed that until Taylor ceases efforts to destabilize the sub-region, U.S. policy will remain unchanged.   The U.S. has been much less vocal about condemning Guinea's flagging human rights record and its destabilization of Liberia. The U.S. has expressed concern about the human rights situation in Guinea in its annual human rights report to the U.S. Congress, but has not made any public statements expressing concern about Guinea's role in supporting the LURD incursion. The closest it came to doing so was in a March 1, 2002 statement in which the U.S. ambassador in Monrovia condemned the renewed fighting in Liberia and called on the Liberian government to take steps to respect human rights and the rule of law. Although it stopped short of naming Guinea, the statement did call on """"all parties in the region to cease supporting any group that seeks political change through violence and to respect their neighbor's borders.""""[1]   The U.S. now has an important role to play vis-à-vis Guinea's support for the LURD. The U.S. is beginning a long-delayed training program for the Guinean military, focusing on border security military to assist that country in defending against the destabilizing activities of the RUF and Charles Taylor in Liberia. In June 2001, the Bush administration notified Congress of its intention to provide U.S. $3 million in non- lethal training and equipment to the Guinean military to assist that country in defending against the destabilizing activities of the RUF and Charles Taylor in Liberia. Congressional concerns about abuses by the Guinean military led to additional reporting and monitoring requirements. The training is designed in four six-week segments for four companies, but will pause after the first two to conduct an impact assessment, which will include monitoring of the troops' behavior once they are deployed on the border, as well as a human rights assessment. State Department sources state that the U.S. has urged President Conté to curtail his support for the LURD, and that the second phase of the U.S. training would be predicated on a cut-off of Guinean support for the LURD.   Additionally, the U.S. has been involved in efforts to address regional security and peacekeeping efforts. In 2000, a program called Operation Focus Relief (OFR) was initiated by former President Bill Clinton to train and equip seven battalions of West African troops for peacekeeping with the U.N. in Sierra Leone. The training was conducted by U.S. Special Forces. The first phase of the program trained two Nigerian battalions that were deployed in January 2001 to serve with UNAMSIL. The second phase, which ended in August, trained troops from Ghana and Sene gal. The third phase, involved three further Nigerian battalions. For FY 2001, OFR was budgeted at U.S. $24 million in peacekeeping funds, as well as U.S. $32 million in Department of Defense funds for equipment and transportation. The U.S. also deployed three military officers to work with the Sierra Leone army as part of the British training program. These officers, as well as other U.S. Embassy officials, had some responsibility for monitoring the performance of the U.S.-trained troops. In addition, for fiscal year 2002, Congress approved U.S. $26 million for the West African Stabilization Program, part of the U.S.'s voluntary peacekeeping operations budget, which includes $8 million in additional training and equipment for the troops trained for peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, known as Operation Focus Relief.  Conclusion  While the election brings much needed peace and security to Sierra Leone, serious human rights issues remain. After a decade of civil war, Sierra Leone's state institutions and economy have been destroyed, and a culture of violence, corruption, and impunity has taken root. The transition period, however, provides a rare opportunity to develop new state institutions that have strong human rights components integrated into their structure, and to create mechanisms that can operate to guarantee, secure, and enforce respect for human rights throughout the society. In particular, the transitional justice mechanisms, the Special Court and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as well as judicial-rebuilding are important. In addition, continued monitoring, transparency, and accountability among the state security and law enforcement agencies are also key.   Steps must also be taken to address the spreading conflict in Liberia, abetted by Guinea's support of the Liberian rebels. There is likely to be a further escalation in human rights abuses against civilians as the area of fighting widens, causing more death and displacement in Liberia. As a result, the fragile peace in Sierra Leone could easily be destabilized as a result of a spillover of the Liberian war.   This is a dire prospect indeed for the people of a region that has already endured so much war, wanton abuse and human suffering over more than a decade. It is imperative, therefore, that all possible efforts are made by the international community to establish conditions for a sustainable peace and the protection of human rights in all three countries in the sub region. To achieve this, the international community will need to adopt a comprehensive sub-regional approach if there is to be any hope.  Recommendations Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. government to work with all relevant parties in the international community to bring sustained pressure to bear on all the Mano River Union countries to: (1) End cross-border attacks and illicit weapons flows; (2) Cease support for armed rebel activity; (3) Respect the rule of law and human rights; (4) Prevent and punish war crimes and other human rights abuses; (5) Create state institutions that are transparent and accountable. In particular, allow judicial independence and ensure that state security and law enforcement forces have clear and public directives governing the duties of its officers, with strict enforcement, and punitive action for violations. Continue to sustain attention on institution building that promotes respect for the rule of law and human rights. Provide greater support to civil society groups and the independent media in the Mano River Union. Condition all U.S. military assistance to Guinea, scheduled to begin in May 2002, on an end to Guinean support for the LURD rebels. Continue to call for the maintaining and strengthening of existing U.N.-mandated controls on the flow of weapons that could destabilize the sub-region, and to establish the mechanisms necessary to break the cycle of impunity. Illicit weapons flows into the sub-region should continue to be monitored, and Guinea's role in the Liberian conflict should be investigated and ended. The U.N. should mandate the placement of international military observers and human rights monitors along the Guinea/Liberia and Sierra Leone/Liberia borders to monitor and investigate cross-border attacks. Advocate for the replacement of the Guinean forces in the UNAMSIL operation in Sierra Leone with non-West African troops that are not implicated in the sub-regional conflict. At a minimum, the Guinea battalions should be removed from Pujehun District, and not be deployed near the Sierra Leone/Liberia border where the likelihood of their involvement in Liberian rebel support and/or refugee intimidation is higher. Work to secure and get commitments for the deployment of an adequate number of troops along the Sierra Leone/Liberia border to prevent cross-border attacks.

The Bank was set up in 1991 to promote private sector development in Eastern European countries that are """"committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics."""" This reference to democratic principles, written into the agreement establishing the EBRD, was an important post-Cold War innovation. While politics are off limits for the World Bank, for example, the EBRD was expressly tasked with taking politics into consideration in its lending activities. The Bank was set up in 1991 to promote private sector development in Eastern European countries that are """"committed to and applying the principles of multiparty democracy, pluralism and market economics."""" This reference to democratic principles, written into the agreement establishing the EBRD, was an important post-Cold War innovation. While politics are off limits for the World Bank, for example, the EBRD was expressly tasked with taking politics into consideration in its lending activities. Unfortunately, when it comes to the important symbolism of the Bank's annual meeting, there is scant evidence of the Bank's stated commitment to democracy. Where in the program of the annual meetings is a seminar on the development of independent media in the region, or its critical role in curbing corruption? Will anyone from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors elections throughout the region, participate in panel discussions? Will any finance minister touting the attractive investment climate in his country also feel compelled to report on his country's progress toward genuine multiparty democracy? Even more telling than this year's agenda is the Bank's choice of Uzbekistan to host next year's annual meeting, a political and financial prize offering the host country an opportunity to showcase its economy to important international investors. Few countries in the region are less deserving than Uzbekistan. In the decade since joining the EBRD, Uzbekistan's transition from communism has produced an authoritarian government profoundly hostile to democracy. The Bank's most recent country strategy for Uzbekistan, adopted in March 2001, reported that economic reforms are slow or stalled, """"[t]he pace of democratic transition is also slow, and serious concerns remain regarding development of genuine multi-party democracy, pluralistic society and respect for human rights."""" The Bank deserves credit for appending this political assessment to its country strategy, but it renders the choice of Tashkent for the annual meeting all the more mystifying. Uzbekistan is home to an estimated 7000 political and religious prisoners, widely tortured in custody and convicted in unfair trials. In the past year alone, seven people have died in custody allegedly due to torture. Uzbekistan has yet to hold an election considered free and fair by international observers. In January President Karimov rigged a referendum to extend his term in office to 2007. Free association and media are severely limited. There is no newspaper in Uzbekistan in which this article could be published. This past week, more than forty fifty non-governmental organizations from twenty-four countries wrote to the Bank to express concern about Tashkent as the site for next year's meetings. These are not just groups concerned with human rights in Uzbekistan. They also include labor, environmental, and humanitarian groups from all corners of the region—members of European civil society who want to see the EBRD take seriously its commitment to open societies and the rule of law. We are concerned that the EBRD has elected to convene in a country where some non-governmental organizations are refused registration, their members regularly harassed or jailed. The EBRD's annual meeting typically includes a program for non-governmental organizations, providing a valuable opportunity for meaningful dialogue with Bank officials on topics of mutual concern. But international non-governmental organizations have difficulty getting visas to visit Uzbekistan. Local Uzbek groups sometimes face harassment and temporary arrest as a consequence of their meeting international visitors. What will become of the civil society program at the Bank's annual meeting if it goes forward in such an environment? What is the message sent to governments intolerant of critical voices? In the heady early days after the Cold War, the Bank's founders embraced the link between political and economic transition now vogue in development circles. The Bank should uphold its commitment to democracy and pluralism, not only because its shareholders promised to do so, but also because the elements of healthy democracy—respect for the rule of law, accountable government institutions, a vibrant civil society and media—are critical to the Bank's economic mission. As Bank President Jean Lemierre acknowledged at last year's annual meeting, transition and sustainable growth have """"been most effective where democracy has taken root best."""" In pursuit of that vision, the Bank should be working with the Uzbek government to achieve some pretty dramatic reform in the next twelve months, or start shopping for another venue for next year's meeting. Highlighting concern for democratic development at this year's meeting would be a good place to start.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/16/hrw-disputes-claim-colombia-met-human-rights-conditions","HRW Disputes Claim that Colombia Met Human Rights Conditions","HRW Disputes Claim that Colombia Met Human Rights Conditions","","05/16/2002","On May 1, the Department of State certified to the U.S. Congress that Colombia had met the three human rights conditions contained in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-115). By law, the State Department must certify before releasing the first tranche of military aid for FY 2002, an estimated $104 million dollars. Human Rights Watch, the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), and Amnesty International strongly objected to the decision. The groups recognized that U.S. officials took the certification process seriously. However, the Colombian government largely rebuffed their efforts, and failed to make progress toward suspending high-ranking military officers implicated in serious abuses and arresting known human rights violators. The human rights situation in Colombia continues to deteriorate, as all illegal armed groups continue to target primarily civilians. In the first four months of 2002, two human rights defenders have been killed. Others who face extreme danger include journalists, community leaders and political candidates. Already in 2002, fifty-two trade unionists have been murdered. Last year, 160 trade unionists were killed and seventy-nine remain """"disappeared."""" 1. SEC. 567. (a) (1) (A) the Commander General of the Colombian Armed Forces is suspending from the Armed Forces those members, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups. The Colombian Armed Forces have refused to act on notorious officers, among them General Rodrigo Quiñones. This is despite a pending judicial decision by the Procuraduría concluding that there is abundant and credible evidence that General Quiñones planned and ordered the murders of at least fifty-seven trade unionists, human rights workers, and community leaders in 1991 and 1992. There is also credible evidence against General Quiñones for failing to act to prevent a 2001 massacre in Chengue, Sucre, described below. The case against him is now in Colombia's Supreme Court. Particularly disturbing was the State Department's decision to review the Quiñones case under condition 3 and not condition 1, in an effort to present it as an example of progress. State Department officials argue that Quiñones was transferred to a diplomatic post in Israel prior to the certification and that this means that his career is over. However, Israel is a major weapons supplier to Colombia. The military attaché retains an influential position within Colombia's military. Quiñones's permanence within the Armed Forces is a sign of Colombia's failure to take effective measures, not progress. Another officer who remains on active duty is General Gabriel Díaz, commander of the Second Brigade. At his previous command at the Twenty-Fourth Brigade, Díaz's troops regularly worked with and supported paramilitary groups in the department of Putumayo. Human Rights Watch obtained extensive, detailed, and consistent evidence showing that the Twenty-Fourth Brigade maintained a close alliance with the paramilitaries, resulting in extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, and death threats. At their base, paramilitaries held a training camp that drew dozens of novice fighters from across Colombia. Human Rights Watch also collected testimony showing that paramilitaries regularly paid military officers for their cooperation. The State Department certification lists nineteen soldiers suspended and detained in 2001. In at least eight of those cases, the actual status of the investigations is far from promising: 3) Army Second Sergeant Humberto Blandón Vargas and 6) Army Major Álvaro Cortés Murillo: Implicated in criminal acts while assigned to the Fourth Brigade in Medellín, these officers were only the lowest ranking among the many officers who contributed to that unit's long record of abuses while it was under the command of General Carlos Ospina Ovalle. Despite widespread and credible reports of massacres, executions, and torture by troops under his command, General Ospina was never suspended. Currently, he is the Army's chief of operations. 4) Army Major César Alonso Maldonado Vidales and 12) Army Captain (ret.) Jorge Ernesto Rojas Galindo: These individuals were detained in relation to the December 2000 attack on trade unionist Wilson Borja. Cell phone records linked Major Maldonado, assigned to army intelligence at Bogotá's Thirteenth Brigade, to one of the assassins. A witness and former soldier also linked him to the attack and named high-ranking officers who he claims approved it, among them General Jorge Enrique Mora, at the time (and currently) commander of the Colombian Army, and Reinaldo Castellanos Trujillo, at the time the commander of the Thirteenth Brigade. On April 23, Colombia's Attorney General, Luis Osorio, abruptly fired the human rights prosecutor handling the case. The prosecutor named as a replacement ordered Major Maldonado freed. Captain Rojas is currently charged with conspiracy to commit murder and attempted murder, but the fate of the entire investigation is now in doubt. 5) Navy Sergeant Rúben Dario Rojas Bolívar and 7) Navy Sergeant Euclides Bosa Mendoza: Both are charged in relation to the 2001 Chengue massacre. During the investigation, one of the prosecutors and three judicial investigators were murdered. The lead human rights also received threats and recently fled Colombia, putting in serious doubt the outcome of the case. Meanwhile the highest-ranking officer implicated - General Rodrigo Quiñones, mentioned above - remains on active duty. 10) Army Captain Juan Carlos Fernández López and 11) Colonel Víctor Matamoros: These officers were indicted for collaboration with and the formation of illegal paramilitary groups between 1997 and 1999 in connection with a series of paramilitary massacres in and around La Gabarra, Norte de Santander, between May and September, 1999. Paramilitaries killed more than 145 people. Despite the gravity of this case, the officer in charge at the time, Brigadier General Alberto Bravo Silva, was never charged. In May 2002, the Human Rights Unit prosecutor in charge of the case was fired, leaving the fate of the case in question. In its annual report, the Bogotá office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights lamented the firing of key prosecutors, which it said """"put into question the independence and autonomy of prosecutors working on investigations related to human rights violations, particularly when paramilitary groups and state agents are implicated."""" 2. SEC. 567. (a) (1) (B) The Colombian Armed Forces are cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities (including providing requested information, such as the identity of persons suspended from the Armed Forces and the nature and cause of the suspension, and access to witnesses and relevant military documents and other information), in prosecuting and punishing in civilian courts those members of the Colombian Armed Forces, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups. 2001 marked an unprecedented wave of attacks against government investigators working on cases involving allegations against the military for their collaboration with paramilitary groups. As mentioned above, prosecutor Yolanda Paternina Negrete, who led the Chengue investigation, told her superiors that Navy officers failed repeatedly to provide her with the support necessary to search a ranch where witnesses claimed the paramilitaries responsible for the massacre were located. On May 27, two investigators working on the case were detained by presumed paramilitaries and are now presumed dead. On August 29, 2001, Prosecutor Paternina was herself killed by unidentified gunmen in Sincelejo, Sucre. On February 6, 2002, another Chengue investigator, Oswaldo Enrique Borja Martínez, was murdered by unknown gunmen. Unidentified gunmen have also murdered key witnesses to several of the cases cited by human rights groups as benchmarks, among them the Santo Domingo case, the case involving General (ret.) Rito Alejo del Río, and the case of Wilson Borja. As a result of the Del Río case, still pending, Attorney General Osorio fired the head of the Human Rights Unit and forced both the vice-Attorney General and the former head of the Human Rights Unit to resign. Of particular concern are the actions of Attorney General Osorio, who has slowed or blocked critical investigations by firing the prosecutors who are preparing cases involving the military. In many regions, prosecutors are simply too afraid to aggressively investigate, fearing both death threats and lack of institutional support for their investigations. In 2002, six human rights prosecutors and one judicial investigator requested special protective measures from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Others have fled Colombia because of threats on their lives. To our knowledge, the Colombian military has refused to transfer all cases of personnel dismissed for alleged human rights crimes to the proper judicial authorities for investigation. 3. SEC. 567. (a) (1) (C) the Colombian Armed Forces are taking effective measures to sever links (including by denying access to military intelligence, vehicles, and other equipment or supplies, and ceasing other forms of active or tacit cooperation), at the command, battalion, and brigade levels, with paramilitary groups, and to execute outstanding orders for capture for members of such groups. The certification provides no evidence of arrests or actions against key paramilitary leaders or high-ranking members of the Armed Forces credibly alleged to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. To the contrary, there were serious setbacks, including the release late last year of the only top paramilitary leader in custody in Colombia, Víctor Carranza. The Colombian government's progress against paramilitary groups has amounted to little more than rhetoric, unsupported by actions in the field designed either to break existing ties between the military and paramilitary groups, prosecute the officers who support these links, or pursue those groups and their leaders effectively in the field. Although the government describes these ties as the result of the acts of """"individual members of the security forces,"""" and not a matter of policy or even tolerance, it is abundantly clear that the range of acts government prosecutors and human rights investigators continue to document depend on the approval, collusion and tolerance of high-ranking officers. The Colombian government claims major improvements in curtailing abuses by paramilitaries and arresting their members. But the facts do not bear out these assertions. Arrest statistics provided by the military are overwhelmingly skewed toward low-ranking members of paramilitary groups or individuals whose participation in these groups is alleged, not proven. The vast majority of arrest warrants for paramilitaries issued by the Attorney General's office languish without action. Meanwhile, the AUC expanded its radius of action and troop strength dramatically in 2001. Since 1996, the number of paramilitaries has grown by over 560 percent. Carlos Castaño, their principal leader, now claims a force of over 11,000 fighters. In 2001, Castaño published a memoir in which he took responsibility for a series of killings, among them of presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro, murdered in 1990. Mayors, municipal officials, governors, human rights groups, the Public Advocate's office and even some police detachments regularly informed the appropriate authorities about credible threats by paramilitaries or even massacres that were taking place. An early warning system paid for by the United States and administered by the office of the Public Advocate registered twenty separate warnings nationwide between June 2001, when the system began to function, and September 2001. But rarely did the government take effective action to prevent atrocities. Of the warnings that were received, eleven incidents resulted either in killings being committed or the continued, pronounced presence of armed groups that threatened civilians. One tragic example is the case of Boyajá, Chocó. Despite repeated warnings from the Catholic Church and office of the Public Advocate about combat between paramilitaries and guerrillas, the government took no measures to protect the civilian population. During a reported clash between the FARC-EP and paramilitary forces on May 2, 2002, civilians sought refuge in a local church. According to credible reports received by Human Rights Watch, at least one gas cylinder bomb fired by the FARC-EP forces struck this church, killing at least 117 civilians, including at least forty-eight children, and injuring at least 114 other civilians.","Americas, Colombia, United States",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/16/sudan-senator-danforth-appointed-special-envoy-peace","Sudan- Senator Danforth Appointed Special Envoy for Peace","Sudan: Senator Danforth Appointed Special Envoy for Peace","Backgrounder on the Danforth Report","05/16/2002","Senator Danforth approached his mission by proposing four tests for the two main parties to the conflict in Sudan to prove their commitment to a peace process: 1) The signing of a ceasefire agreement for the conflict in the Nuba Mountains, allowing humanitarian access, to be monitored by a team of fifteen to twenty-five international personnel; 2) An agreement by both sides not to attack or target civilians or civilian objects in the war in the south, also to be monitored, by a verification mission of fifteen international professional staff; 3) The appointment of a commission consisting of eminent persons from many countries, which will investigate and make recommendations for practical solutions to the problem of slavery in Sudan; and 4) Respect for “zones of tranquility” in the conflict areas, enabling humanitarian agencies to carry out polio vaccinations and campaigns against rinderpest and guinea worm. Senator Danforth visited Sudan most recently in January 2002. His work as special envoy and the imposition of the four tests, initially received with skepticism, have produced some positive results for the promotion of human rights and the prospects for peace in Sudan. By late March 2002, both the government of Sudan and the SPLA had agreed to the four points. In particular, the Nuba Mountains ceasefire agreement was signed by both parties January 19, 2002, in Switzerland, and the agreement not to attack or target civilians or civilian objects was signed March 10 by the government and March 25 by the SPLA. However, the four points have not yet been fully implemented. 1. Nuba Mountains humanitarian ceasefire agreement. The Nuba Mountains, in the center of Sudan and not geographically contiguous with the south or other areas of rebel activity, is an area contested only between government and SPLA forces. The Danforth report correctly notes that until very recently the Nuba Mountains “had been under siege for almost two decades by the Government, which used military force and starvation as weapons, and which applied cultural and religious pressures against the people who live there. The government had allowed no relief into certain targeted areas of the Nuba Mountains for thirteen years to reinforce food pressures upon the population.” The ceasefire agreement contains significant human rights provisions: article 3 (d) says it forbids """"all acts of violence against or other abuse of the civilian population"""" and then provides a long list of actions that would qualify as abuse. In the context of Senator Danforth’s efforts, even before the ceasefire agreement was signed, the government allowed the delivery of international aid to the Nuba Mountains in late 2001 for the first time since the war came to the area in 1986. The January 2002 ceasefire agreement provides for free movement to and from the SPLA-controlled areas of the Nuba Mountains, and for civilians to return to the land from which the army expelled them. There are twelve monitors currently in place, military observers from the U.S. and Europe operating under the command of a Norwegian general. They report to a Joint Military Commission (JMC) created under the Nuba Mountains ceasefire agreement. The JMC consists of three representatives from each party and three neutrals appointed by participating countries in consultation with the parties; the neutrals are to be chair and two vice chairs of the JMC. The ceasefire is holding, although both sides have complained of some violations. The Danforth report states that the aim of U.S. policy should be to move the parties in the Nuba Mountains (government and SPLA) toward a comprehensive ceasefire and toward developing “their confidence in working with each other and us in a practical, nonpolitical manner.” One impediment to achieving this aim will be that, at this moment, there is no clearly designated person or institution in the Nuba Mountains responsible for receiving complaints from the civilian population and organizations, investigating them, and taking steps to address them. There are at least ten human rights monitors who have been operating independently on the SPLA side of the Nuba Mountains, documenting government abuses, since 1995, trained and assisted by the London-based human rights organization Justice Africa. There has been no coordination with or outreach to this organization or these monitors, whose reporting skills and background knowledge would be invaluable to the Joint Military Commission. 2. Agreement not to target civilians or civilian objects in the war in the south If observed, this agreement will mark a significant step forward in ensuring respect for human rights and international humanitarian law in Sudan. Neither the government nor the SPLA have previously agreed in writing to refrain from targeting civilians and civilian objects, nor have they permitted the deployment of international (or national) monitors. Senator Danforth’s report indicates that negotiations on this point took months, and that “we encountered stiff resistance to our proposal to end intentional military attacks against civilians…” As the Danforth report notes, the verification mechanism is not yet in place. The U.S. has undertaken the responsibility for pulling it together and “taking the lead in providing both financial and personnel support to ensure success.” It is intended that fifteen experienced professionals will staff the mechanism, which will be headquartered in Khartoum (at government insistence) with a secondary office in Rumbek. This is not ideal: Khartoum is hundreds of kilometers from the south and from any fighting. Rumbek, the SPLA headquarters, is in Bahr El Ghazal, is not a central location for relief personnel or operations, and is subject to arbitrary government flight bans of U.N. and nongovernmental planes serving the relief scheme. The agreement is clear, however, that the verification team is entitled to have access anywhere it wants—though, because of the immense size of southern Sudan, it is unlikely that fifteen professionals will be adequate to cover the area and investigate all claims of breach of the agreement. Senator Danforth notes that the upsurge in oil production in 1999 has reshaped Sudan's civil war and that the government apparently sees the recent reconciliation of two factions of the SPLA as a serious threat to the oil fields. Accordingly, the government bargained hard to specifically include oil installations as “civilian objects” which the SPLA could not target under the agreement. The SPLA bargained also to specifically exclude oil installations as “civilian objects.” The negotiators achieved agreement by the parties that the language would remain silent on this point and that the monitors would make a determination on a case-by-case basis. However, in the event that oil installations are targeted, this will be a controversial point, and the U.S. and other interested parties should plan a response calculated to keep the government engaged should the monitors decide an oil installation is not a civilian object in a particular case. Despite this agreement, several recent reports state that the situation in Western Upper Nile, one part of southern Sudan affected by the civil war, is extremely desperate for civilians, who are being forcibly displaced from their homes and grazing areas by Baggara Arab militiamen on horseback, armed by the government, and by government helicopter gunships and troops. Many of these people already have been displaced once or more. The raiders on horseback have used a bridge built by an oil company at Bentiu to cross into territory previously protected from their raids by a deep river, to attack people who years ago fled over the river for safety. A recent report by Medecins Sans Frontieres points out the health consequences of war to Western Upper Nile alone, where more than 100,000 people died of kala azar, a parasitic disease, that was untreated because of the war and denial of access. 3. Anti-slavery initiative:  The Sudan government and the SPLA have agreed to the establishment of a commission to look into the issue of slavery (or abduction and forced labor, as the government calls it), which is to investigate the problem and make practical recommendations to address it. The commission consists of a panel of eight “eminent persons” designated by the governments participating in the investigation: two from the U.S., two from the U.K., one from Italy, two from Norway, and one from France. The eight commissioners are joined by a technical team of four experienced researchers: two U.S. citizens, one U.K. citizen, and one Canadian. The commission plans to visit the region twice for ten days each, in April and May 2002, and to report findings and recommendations at the end of May. In addition, the Danforth report states that U.S. AID and the State Department are making funds available to promote reconciliation between the Dinka (who have been raided for slaves) and the “marauding raiders” (the Baggara). It is essential that any disbursement of funds along these lines be controlled and coordinated by a long-term monitoring body, to ensure in particular that no funds can reach the perpetrators of abuses. See also http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/africa/sudanupdate.htm 4. Days of tranquility Implementation of obviously beneficial medical campaigns—to combat polio, guinea worm, and bovine rinderpest—has been much more difficult than the Danforth mission anticipated. The Danforth report states that there has been great confusion over these three programs and over where the responsibility lies for delays. The report also notes that the Sudan government “tries to manipulate the process to tighten control of supplies going to SPLM areas,” and that the SPLA often has demanded that U.N. flights neither originate in nor fly over government-controlled territory. In the past, the government has frequently imposed bans on access by U.N. relief planes to any area it wishes, without explanation. This confusion over responsibility may be due in part to the fact that the agreement calls for limited access: to specific but different areas during specified but different times to implement three different programs. What is needed, rather, is an agreement for full and unimpeded humanitarian access to all areas and for all programs. Both parties should agree that they will permit relief flights and other deliveries and will advise the humanitarian relief agencies in a timely manner if they consider any area unsafe for relief operations. The U.N. humanitarian security staff may then make its own assessment, and the relief operations should be undertaken on its sole authority, without further need for government or other clearance. In the meantime, a firm deadline for compliance with the existing agreement should be imposed and penalties attached to a party's failure to meet the deadline.","Africa, South Sudan, Sudan, United States","Crisis and Conflict, Peace and Justice"

The journalists were detained after the authorities banned all private and independent publications in Eritrea in September 2001. They began a hunger strike in late March to protest their detention, and on April 3 were transferred from Police Station One in Asmara to an undisclosed location. Eleven political dissidents imprisoned in harsh conditions since September 2001 also remain in custody.  “Suppression of the independent press means that the Eritrean people have no access to information except from government sources,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  The Eritrean government should immediately release the journalists and political dissidents or charge them with a recognizable criminal offense. They should be held in an acknowledged, legally established place of detention pending release, with access to relatives and lawyers. The government should also lift the ban on the independent press.  The government closed all independent press outlets in September 2001, and arrested ten journalists without charge. Two others fled the country to evade arrest. The ten were initially held at a police station in Asmara, the capital. According to a message smuggled out of the police station, after six months without charge they began a hunger strike on March 31, 2001, demanding release or public trial. Nine of the journalists were then whisked away to a secret location where they are being held incommunicado. (The tenth journalist, a Swedish national by the name of Dawit Isaac, was taken to hospital, reportedly because of injuries from torture.) The detained journalists include Yosef Mohamed Ali, Amanuel Asrat, and Said Abdulkadir, chief editors respectively of the Tsigenay, Zemen, and Admas newspapers.  In addition, the Eritrean government also has arrested anyone suspected of supporting critics of the president, Isayas Afewerki, or of calling for democratic reform. In a mid-2001 crackdown, the government arrested eleven senior government officials after the release of their letter to the president in May 2001 criticizing him and pressing for full implementation of the constitution and other reforms. (Two signatories were outside the country at the time of the arrests; two others recanted.) The eleven are still in detention.  After students at the University of Asmara protested mismanagement of a summer work program, the government also arrested the president of the student union in July 2001. Those arrests were followed by the arrest of prominent elderly businessmen who attempted to mediate between the president and his critics. The pace of arrests quickened in March and April 2002 when the government began to arrest military officers and other suspected dissidents—including three employees of the government press. There are reportedly between sixty and eighty persons in detention apparently because of their criticism of the government, in addition to the detained officials and journalists.  International human rights law recognizes the fundamental principles that detainees have the right to be free of torture and mistreatment, and that no one shall be subjected to prolonged arbitrary detention by the government.  “Now that the Eritrea/Ethiopia war is formally over, and both governments have accepted the arbitration decision on the border dispute, the Eritrean government has run out of excuses for refusing to apply the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its own constitution’s guarantees,” said Takirambudde.  The Eritrean constitution, drafted in 1997 but not yet promulgated, contains essential human rights guarantees such as the right of a detainee to be brought before a court within forty-eight hours of arrest, to petition for a writ of habeas corpus, and to be informed of the grounds for arrest (Article 17(3)-(5)). It also prohibits cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment for detainees or prisoners (Article 16(2)). These rights parallel those in international law.","Africa, Eritrea",""

A report prepared for President Bush by former U.S. Sen. John Danforth, U.S. Special Envoy for Peace in Sudan was released today in Washington.  The report states that the parties to the long war in Sudan are serious enough about peace to warrant the energetic participation of the U.S. in a long-term peace process. The war is not winnable by either side and the time is ripe for a major push for a compromise settlement, the report concludes.  “This long-awaited report makes human rights recommendations that are crucial to the future of Sudan,” said Human Rights Watch Sudan researcher Jemera Rone.  Human Rights Watch welcomed the report’s implicit recognition that human rights violations are central to the causes of the nineteen-year civil war in Sudan, and that recently concluded agreements will require continued international monitoring to be successful. Human Rights Watch also agreed with the report's stress on constant vigilance and international monitoring of compliance with recent agreements between the government and rebel forces.  “The United States can play a key role in efforts to secure peace and human rights in Sudan,” said Rone. “Senator Danforth has made a useful contribution, and President Bush now needs to pledge the United States’ firm support for human rights as a key to the peace process.”  Since his appointment by President Bush in September 2001, Senator Danforth has successfully negotiated four important agreements between the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). Both the government and the SPLA have agreed to a ceasefire in the central Nuba Mountains area, as well as to cease targeting civilians and civilian objects in the civil war in the south of the country. Compliance with both these agreements is to be secured by the posting of ceasefire monitors for the Nuba Mountains and international monitors to verify the “no civilian targeting” agreement. In addition, both parties have agreed to an investigation of the issue of slavery by an international commission, and to “days of tranquility” for the carrying out of three short-term medical programs in the south.  International ceasefire monitors are already in place in the Nuba Mountains, where the ceasefire is holding. In the south, however, the verification mission is not yet in place. In the meantime, the situation of civilians remains desperate, especially in Western Upper Nile, the location of Sudan’s most active oil exploration. Government militias supported by helicopter gunships are continuing to forcibly displace people from their homes and grazing areas. The government militias on horseback have used a bridge built by an oil company at Bentiu to cross into territory previously protected from their raids by a deep river, to attack people who years ago fled over the river for safety.  Human Rights Watch called for the verification mission in the south to be deployed as soon as possible, and to be strengthened from its planned membership of fifteen in order to be able to cover the vast geographical area of the south, where transportation and communications infrastructure is primitive to nonexistent.  “The U.S., having persuaded the parties to agree to honor some human rights obligations, should spare no effort in making sure that the parties live up to these obligations. The United States should hold both parties to their commitments to implement and honor these agreements,” Rone said.  Human Rights Watch applauded the strong U.S. condemnation of the February 20, 2002 government bombing of a food distribution site in Bieh, Western Upper Nile, Southern Sudan. This government attack, by two helicopter gunships which flew so low the pilots' faces could be seen, killed twenty-four civilians waiting for emergency food rations. The U.S. immediately suspended negotiations with Khartoum. The Sudan government apologized for the killings, agreed in principle and later in writing not to target civilians or civilian objects in the war in the south, and negotiations resumed  One shortcoming of the Danforth report, according to Human Rights Watch, is that in discussing strategies for the future it elevates freedom of religion above other basic rights. This approach fails to come to grips with the broad nature of human rights violations that are the root causes of the nineteen-year-old civil war. The use of torture, prolonged arbitrary detention, extrajudicial executions, the lack of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, and in particular second-class citizenship and discrimination on the grounds of race and ethnicity against many Sudanese, not only southerners, have all contributed to the current conflict. The government has continually attacked southerners in the war zones—the majority of whom practice traditional African religions—and drives them from their homes, destroying and looting homes and cattle, and then prevents emergency assistance from reaching them.  Human Rights Watch takes no position on the issue of self-determination, and it cautioned that the report's endorsement of unity in preference to self-determination should not dominate discussion of the report.  """"The Danforth report is not U.S. policy at this time,"""" Rone said. """"Uproar over the self-determination point has distracted from the real human rights accomplishments of the Danforth agreements, and the need to provide substantial resources to see their implementation.","Africa, United States, Sudan","Religious Freedom"

Human Rights Watch today condemned the Liberian government for its continuing persecution of human rights defenders, and expressed concern about Mr. Gongloe’s detention, for the second time in less than a month, and denial of his right to freedom of movement. """"The continued persecution of human rights lawyer Tiawan Gongloe symbolizes the Taylor government’s disappointing disregard for the rule of law,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “Mr. Gongloe has done nothing more than call on the government to respect human rights.”  Mr. Gongloe was arrested leaving Liberia’s Robertsfield International Airport, after he was prevented from traveling to Sierra Leone as an election observer with the U.S.-based Carter Center Election Observer Team. Mr. Gongloe was waiting to board a plane to Sierra Leone, after passing through immigration at Robertsfield International Airport, when he was informed by immigration officers that he could not leave the country, and had to report to the Immigration Office in Monrovia. Instead of being taken to Immigration, Mr. Gongloe was brought instead to the National Security Agency (NSA). He was held there for four hours, and released to the Catholic Archbishop only after interventions were made on his behalf.  “Given his previous treatment at the hands of the government, Mr. Gongloe remains at great risk of further brutality and intimidation,” said Takirambudde. “President Charles Taylor must immediately end this harassment and intimidation of rights activists.”  There are serious concerns about Mr. Gongloe’s health since he is still recovering after being severely beaten in police custody on April 24, 2002. He was held in a hospital under police guard for one week before being released on bond. No charges were ever brought against Mr. Gongloe.  This incident is the most recent in a spate of arrests carried out by the government since it imposed a state of emergency on February 8, 2002. In the face of renewed rebel action and negative international publicity, the government of President Charles Taylor has become increasingly intolerant of criticism. In particular, the government has intensified its harassment and intimidation of the independent press, civil society groups, and non-violent political opposition groups.","Africa, Liberia",""

Why was the U.S. voted off the United Nations Human Rights Commission? What are the positions on issues that the U.S. has taken in the past which have been perceived as having put them on the wrong side of human rights? What is the significance of this move? What will the consequences be?  When and how can the U.S. get back on the Commission? What actions toward the U.N. might the congress take? Should the U.S. withhold dues from the U.N. because it is not on the Human Rights Commission? What could the consequences be?  What credibility will the human rights commission have when its members now include countries whose records of human rights abuses are atrocious? What good did the U.S. ever do on the Commission anyway? What can we do to help the U.S. earn and deserve its place back on the commission? Does the removal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission indicate that America will be held accountable for its own human rights abuses both domestic and international? Why was the U.S. voted off the United Nations Human Rights Commission?In addition to the usual targets of U.S. criticism, the U.S. has alienated many of its traditional allies. The United Nations Economic and Social Council, a body composed of 54 member states, elects members of the Commission on Human Rights (CHR), for a set number of seats for each of the five regional groups (African, Asian, Latin American, East European and Western and Others). The U.S. is part of the last one, along with all west European countries, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and Israel. This year there were four candidates for three regional slots.All 54 members of ECOSOC vote, but the competition is within each group, thus the U.S. was competing against Austria, France and Sweden, all of which received more votes.Governments have been resenting the U.S. in part because the U.S. has been vocal on particularly abusive country situations, but also increasingly because the U.S. has been on the wrong side of important human rights issues such as the International Criminal Court, and the treaty to ban landmines. Most of the U.S.'s traditional allies have been on the other side of these issues. What are the positions on issues that the U.S. has taken in the past which have been perceived as having put them on the wrong side of human rights?Most recently U.S. tried to block the drafting process to create a Convention on Disappearances.During the last session of the CHR, the U.S. was also completely alone against all others with respect to resolutions on the availability of drugs to AIDS victims and the right to food, where it abstained on the former and voted no on the latter. These were very symbolic actions and many actors in Geneva were astonished and upset. What is the significance of this move? What will the consequences be? The move has important symbolic significance. The U.S. has been on the Commission continuously since its inception in 1947.In practice however, it really is not as significant. The U.S. can do everything except vote. The U.S. can participate in Commission meetings, it just has a shorter speaking time and must speak in a different order.While it is not on the Commission, the U.S. can not sponsor resolutions alone, but it can still initiate resolutions if it finds a co-sponsor. The U.S. can and should be as active as ever. When and how can the U.S. get back on the Commission?Next year the U.S. should be a candidate and should lobby vigorously to be assured the vote. What actions toward the U.N. might the congress take? Should the U.S. withhold dues from the U.N. because it is not on the Human Rights Commission? What could the consequences be? On May 10, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to not pay the dues it owes the U.N. until the U.S. is restored to the Commission. At this time, the U.S. Senate is still drafting its own version of the legislation. Needless to say, if the U.S. decides not to pay its arrears this will further alienate the U.S. from the U.N. members. See HRW's letter to Representatives Hyde and Lantos and statement to the press. What credibility will the human rights commission have when its members now include countries whose records of human rights abuses are atrocious?The Commission is indeed losing credibility and weakening its effectiveness by adding members with bad human rights records. Our position is that countries with bad human rights records should not be on the commission. They are there to protect themselves. See HRW Executive Director Ken Roth's Op-ed on the subject Despots Pretending to Spot and Shame Despots. What good did the U.S. ever do on the Commission anyway?Recently the U.S. has been the most inclined to be principled on individual country issues. They are much stronger and much more forthcoming than other many Commission members. European countries that promote specific country issues tend to negotiate WITH the actual countries in question in order to achieve consensus. This results in weak resolutions.Historically, United States was a leading force when it came to establishing the Commission itself. Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the key authors of Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It's ironic that U.S. is so opposed now to creating and joining new legal instruments. What can we do to help the U.S. earn and deserve its place back on the commission?The U.S. should not turn its back on U.N.. It should be more engaged and more focused. Where it has been principled, it should continue to do so.Part of the reason the EU countries did not want to accommodate U.S. is because of the U.S. human rights record, particularly with regards to the death penalty. U.S. is the only country in its regional group that uses the death penalty. Europeans are very concerned about the death penalty. The U.S. should work on its own human rights record and listen to criticisms coming from other countries. This makes it gives it a better position when it works on its return to the commission. Does the removal of the United States from the United Nations Human Rights Commission indicate that America will be held accountable for its own human rights abuses both domestic and international?The U.S. was held accountable with respect to not being voted back on the Commission. It is a sign that people are watching the U.S. very closely.","United States","United Nations"

The Malaysian prime minister is due to meet with Bush on May 14. This is Dr. Mahathir's first White House visit since 1994.  Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration to call for the repeal of Malaysia's Internal Security Act (ISA), which was adopted almost 40 years ago to combat Communist rebels and is frequently used by Dr. Mahathir to quash peaceful dissent. Currently, at least 105 people are being detained under the ISA. Among those targeted under the ISA over the last year were minority Shi'a Muslims, supporters of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and youth leaders in the opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS, Partai Islam Se-Malaysia), although individuals linked to specific violent acts were also among those detained.  """"Dr. Mahathir is manipulating the war against terrorism, to justify the use of this repressive law,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The Bush administration should make clear that it rejects that kind of opportunism, and wants to see real improvement in Malaysia's human rights record - starting with the repeal of the ISA.""""  The ISA provides for arbitrary arrest and detention without trial for an indefinite period based on mere suspicion that one """"may be likely"""" to commit an act deemed dangerous to national security. A detainee is, therefore, presumed guilty without trial. It further allows a detainee to be held under solitary confinement for 60 days without legal counsel or judicial review.  Those suspected of involvement in violent acts including acts of terrorism should be charged and brought to trial under Malaysia's criminal laws, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch today released a 6-page background paper on the ISA and recent detentions, including the arrest of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim originally held under the ISA and later convicted on other charges. He is now serving a 15-year prison term.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about restrictions on free expression and free assembly, and restrictions on the press and academic freedom.","Asia, United States, Malaysia",""

For too many years, trafficking in persons was seen solely as a criminal justice issue and, absent particularly compelling circumstances, was treated as a """"victimless"""" crime. Over the last several years as an increasing number of cases of trafficking in human beings has come to light and as human rights activists around the globe have organized to address this human rights abuse, our understanding of trafficking has grown.   It has become increasingly obvious to those of us who work on trafficking that the only way to successfully end trafficking is for states to hold abusers accountable and to remedy the underlying human rights abuses that created the conditions for trafficking.   Much has been said about the root causes of trafficking; poverty, discrimination -- particularly against women, children and minorities -- , violence, and general insecurity often related to armed conflict. These are significant human rights violations that explain, in part, why human beings end up at the mercy of traffickers who trap victims in debt bondage and slavery like conditions.   And, much has been said about the human rights abuses victims of trafficking face when trafficked. Yet, despite this apparent sympathy for trafficking victims, states have been quick to distinguish between so-called """"innocent"""" victims of trafficking and victims who states effectively blame and punish.   Part of the problem is that any victim of cross border trafficking will not have valid immigration papers. Just as an increasing number of states now penalize asylum seekers for irregular entry into a country of refuge, so too are many victims of trafficking punished as """"illegal migrants."""" Additionally, when the form of forced labor into which the person is trafficked is illegal, some states treat the victim of trafficking as a criminal.   The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has as its foundation the simple but powerful idea that """"all persons are born free and equal in dignity and rights."""" This concept demands that states treat people and promote their rights with the understanding that equality, or nondiscrimination, is critical to the promotion of the human rights of all people. One of the most important steps that states must take in ensuring the rehabilitation of trafficked victims is to end the practice of ranking and privileging some victims over others, for example, the so-called """"innocent"""" victims v. so-called 'irresponsible"""" or """"guilty"""" victim.   But this is not just about perceptions and judgments by states about which victims are innocents and which are guilty. It is also about recognizing some forms of trafficking while denying the harms done in other forms. For example, in the U.S. it was a battle to get the domestic legislation on trafficking to include all victims, not just those trafficked into forced sex work. And this is an important point, while government delegates legitimately talk of the horrors of sexual violence against trafficking victims who end up in sexual slavery, they ignore the sexual violence and abuse that is rampant among victims forced into other forms of forced labor.   If you talk with women and children who work in sweatshops, in domestic servitude, etc. - you will hear the stories of physical and sexual abuse - because at its core, trafficking is about the process of reducing human beings to property - fungible property at that. And, an indication of ownership in most cultures is the owner's right to absolutely control the property, even destroy it.   Once we understand trafficking and the harm done - it is easy to understand what action states must take to rehabilitate victims and work toward their successful reintegration into society. Any program must first and foremost return control to the victims. It is only when we have created the space for the trafficking victim to see her or himself again as a person, not an object, whose agency we respect and whose value is inherent, that she or he becomes a survivor.   Sometimes, in a rush to accomplish other goals, such as prosecuting the traffickers, states focus on victims for the information they can provide or their usefulness to the criminal justice system. The danger is that states treat the victims as merely a pawn in a struggle between the state and the trafficker not as a human being in need of services and deserving of respect.   I could go into detail about the need for housing and other basic necessities, the importance of counseling, medical care, legal advice, access to job training programs and education. But, realistically, the challenge for states is not identifying the services that victims of trafficking need to survive and grow. The challenge that we face is in getting states to see and respect, at the most basic level, the humanity of all victims and to get states to work with victims/survivor in a way that demonstrates their commitment to the protecting the equality and dignity of all human beings.   We must speak up when some victims of trafficking are dismissed as undeserving of rights and respect. We must protest when states refuse to recognize all forms of trafficking in human beings. And, of course, we must reject the practice of criminalizing victims of trafficking and placing their lives at risk through summary deportations or their psychological well being at risk though detention or imprisonment.   Thank you.","Global","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/13/malaysia-internal-security-act-stifles-political-dissent","Malaysia- Internal Security Act Stifles Political Dissent","Malaysia: Internal Security Act Stifles Political Dissent","A Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","05/13/2002","Since the September 11 attacks in the United States, Prime Minister Mahathir has justified use of the Internal Security Act (ISA) on counter-terrorism grounds. The September attacks also prompted a major shift in U.S. policy regarding political repression in Malaysia. In July 2001, Foreign Minister Syed Hamid met with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington, D.C. just weeks after Anwar Ibrahim's wife, Wan Azizah, met with senior State Department officials. State Department officials reportedly told the foreign minister that a meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Mahathir could take place only if there were progress on Anwar's case and in the treatment of political dissidents. But when Mahathir and Bush met at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Shanghai last October, Bush made no public comment on Malaysia's human rights record or the detention of political dissidents. The White House subsequently agreed to Mahathir's visit this week, from May 13-15, to thank him for Malaysia's efforts against terrorism. But the draconian and anachronistic ISA has long been and continues to be used as a tool to stifle peaceful political dissent. Political activists in the past have been detained under the ISA for more than a decade without trial. President Bush must make it clear that the fight against terrorism does not justify the wholesale use of the ISA to suppress dissent, to violate internationally guaranteed rights to due process and freedom from arbitrary detention, and to undermine the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. Those suspected of involvement in violent acts including acts of terrorism should be charged and brought to trial under Malaysia's criminal laws. Malaysia's Internal Security Act (ISA) is a preventive detention law originally enacted in the early 1960s during a national state of emergency as a temporary measure to fight a communist rebellion. Under Section 73 (1) of the ISA, police may detain any person for up to 60 days, without warrant or trial and without access to legal counsel, on suspicion that """"he has acted or is about to act or is likely to act in any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia or any part thereof or to maintenance of essential services therein or to the economic life thereof."""" After 60 days, the Minister of Home Affairs can then extend the period of detention without trial for up to two years, without submitting any evidence for review by the courts, by issuing a detention order, which is renewable indefinitely. The law has repeatedly been criticized by Malaysian human rights groups, the Malaysian Bar Council, the Malaysian Human Rights Commission, and international human rights groups, which called for its repeal. The ISA's provisions violate fundamental international human rights standards, including prohibitions on arbitrary detention and guarantees of the right to due process and the right to a prompt and impartial trial. The U.S. State Department's Country Report on Human Rights Practices issued on March 4, 2002, was highly critical of Malaysia's continued use of the ISA and noted that last year, """"police increased their use of the ISA to arrest and detain many persons, including members of the political opposition, without charge or trial….In the latter half of the year, the Government stepped up its pro-ISA rhetoric."""" Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed has vigorously defended the use of the ISA, saying it has been useful in fighting insurgent groups threatening national security. In November 2000, the ruling coalition suffered a by-election defeat in Mahathir's home district in Kedah state and the government faced increasingly vocal opposition protests. Not for the first time, it used the ISA against its political opponents. Among those targeted under the ISA were minority Shi'a Muslims, supporters of jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, and youth leaders in the opposition Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS, Partai Islam Se-Malaysia), although individuals linked to specific violent acts were also among those detained. Background on Use of the ISA The Act provides for arbitrary arrest and detention without trial for an indefinite period based on mere suspicion that one """"may be likely"""" to commit an act deemed dangerous to national security. A detainee is, therefore, presumed guilty without trial. It further allows a detainee to be held under solitary confinement for 60 days without legal counsel. When the Act was first adopted, it did allow for judicial review, but since then, the ISA has been amended over 20 times, and this provision has been removed. Absolute power is given to the Minister of Home Affairs to arbitrarily detain anyone, without reference to the courts. In addition to provisions for arrest, the ISA allows for restrictions on freedom of assembly, association, and expression, freedom of movement, residence and employment. It also allows for the closing of schools and educational institutions if they are used as a meeting place for an unlawful organization or for any other reason are deemed detrimental to the interests of Malaysia or the public. Over the years, the Malaysian government has consistently used the Act for its own political purposes to detain thousands of citizens, including political opposition leaders, academicians, trade unionists, religious, social, environmental, and women's rights activists. The ISA was used to arrest political opponents of Mahathir in a major crackdown in 1987-88, as well as politicians in Sabah, east Malaysia, in 1990, whose party was considered a major rival to the ruling party, UMNO. In November 1997, ten people were arrested under the ISA for allegedly spreading Shiite teachings deemed detrimental to national security; Muslims in Malaysia are Sunnis. The ISA was used in 1998 to arrest Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and six of his political supporters. Anwar was the primary leader of opposition to Mahathir, and is currently serving a 15-year sentence following convictions in 1999 and 2000 in politically motivated trials for sodomy and corruption and abuse of power. Former ISA detainees have testified to being subjected to severe physical and psychological torture, including allegations of physical assault, forced nudity, sleep deprivation, around-the-clock interrogation, death threats, threats of bodily harm to family members, including threats of rape and bodily harm to their children. Detainees are often kept in solitary confinement in tiny, dark cells. Prolonged torture and deprivation have led to some to sign state-manufactured """"confessions"""" under severe duress. During the first trial of former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, police admitted to the courts that the process of 'extracting confessions' under duress was standard practice. Currently, there are 105 ISA detainees being held in Kamunting prison camp. Recent ISA Arrests In April 2001, prior to a planned a demonstration marking the second anniversary of the sentencing of prisoner of conscience Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysian police detained nine opposition activists and a human rights defender under the ISA:  Chua Tian Chiang, Vice President, Parti Keadilan Nasional (PKN - National Justice Party, known as Keadilan); Mohd Ezam Mohd Noor, National Youth Chief, PKN; Haji Saari Sungip, PKN activist; Hishamuddin Rais, media columnist and social activist; Raja Petra Kamaruddin, Director of Free Anwar Campaign; N. Gobala Krishnan, Secretary General, PKN Youth; Abdul Ghani Harun, PKN Youth Central Committee member; Dr Badrul Amin Baharom, PKN Youth leader; Lokman Nor Adam, Executive Secretary, PKN Youth Wing; Badaruddin Ismail, human rights defender.  Five of the activists belonged to the opposition PKN party, headed by Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah. The detainees were apparently also planning to submit a memorandum to the Malaysian Commission on Human Rights regarding Anwar's trial. Dr Badrul Amin Baharom and Lokman Nor Adam, leading members of the PKN, were arrested on April 20, 2001. Dr. Badrul Amin Baharom was released on November 2, but tight restrictions were placed on his movements and he was prohibited from speaking publicly. He broke the restrictions and was rearrested on January 31, 2002. On 26 April 26, 2001 Malaysian police arrested human rights defender Badaruddin Ismail, who is a member of the secretariat of a leading human rights organization, Suara Rakyat Malaysia (Suaram, Voice of the Malaysian People). He had been assisting families of detainees and monitoring the National Human Rights Commission enquiry into police brutality. No reason for his arrest has been given. On May 30, in an unusual and courageous ruling, Judge Hishamuddin Yunus ordered the release of two ISA detainees on a writ of habeas corpus (an order that a prisoner to be brought before a court to determine whether his detention is lawful), and suggested that the parliament should review and either scrap or amend the ISA to reduce its potential for abuse. In July 2001, the authorities detained two student activists, Khairul Anuar Ahmad Zainuddin and Mohamad Fuad Mohamad Ikhwan, under the ISA, the former for twenty-three days and the latter for ten days. Also in July, the government banned all political rallies stating that they would undermine the country's security. When the Pan Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS), an opposition party making inroads since the 1999 general election, subsequently planned a series of meetings to protest the policy, police refused to grant permits and dispersed those who attempted to attend. On August 2-4, police detained another ten people under the ISA, all of whom were affiliated with or supporters of PAS, including four prominent youth leaders. The authorities said the ten belonged to a group (known by the initials KMM) that planned to overthrow the government, sometimes labeling the group the Malaysian Militant Group and sometimes the Malaysian Mujahedin Group. One of those detained, Nik Adli Nik Aziz, was the son of a leading PAS official. The authorities alleged he had received military training in Afghanistan and had learned bomb making from Muslim rebels in the Philippines, but he denied this and PAS leaders emphasized that they used only peaceful, democratic means in their struggle against the ruling coalition. As of May, most of them were still detained under two-year detention orders. The police have claimed that the opposition PKN party activists were planning violent street demonstrations to overthrow the government although no evidence supporting this accusation has ever been presented before the courts. Many non-governmental organizations believe the real reason for the arrests is to suppress legitimate peaceful dissent against the arrest and sentencing of Anwar Ibrahim. The Malaysian Human Rights Commission has repeatedly said that detention without trial under the Internal Security Act violates fundamental human rights, and if the detainees were not charged and tried in an open court they should be immediately released. Following their initial detention, the families of five of the detainees--Mohammad Ezam Mohd Noor, Haji Saari Sungip, Raja Petra Kamaruddin, Dr Badrul Amin Baharom and Lokman Nor Adam--expressed concern that while the detainees did not show signs of physical assault, they were unwilling to speak of their interrogation, and returned repeatedly to the subject of the safety of their families. To date, two of the detainees have been freed pending their Federal Court case (Gobala Krishnan Abdul Ghani Harun) and six (the """"ISA Six"""") remain under two-year detention order in Kamunting Detention Center in Northern Perak state: Badrul Amin, Chua Tian Chang, Hishamuddin Rais, Lokman Adam, Mohd Ezam Mohd Nor, and Saari Sungib. On April 10, 2002, the six ISA detainees observed the one-year anniversary of their detention by beginning a hunger strike to protest their detention. The strike was suspended on April 21, 2002. The detainees are allowed weekly family visits. Restrictions on the press and academic freedoms In addition to the ISA detentions, the Mahathir government has suppressed peaceful political opposition by restricting media and academic freedoms. Throughout 2001, Malaysia's ruling National Front coalition, led by Prime Minister Mahathir, sought to broaden already tight controls on the press through what the US-based Committee for the Protection of Journalists called """"coercion, ownership changes, verbal bullying, and backroom personnel moves."""" The Printing Presses and Publications Act presently requires all publications to obtain an annual press license to operate, which can be withdrawn without judicial review. A special office in the Home Affairs Ministry censors all foreign publications and has repeatedly delayed publications deemed critical of the government. For example, in March 2001, censors delayed release of both Far Eastern Economic Review and Asiaweek editions chronicling the growing opposition to Mahathir and signs of political unrest. The government asserts control through its ownership of virtually all major media, either through the ruling National Front parties or Mahathir's allies. In May, the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA), a senior partner in the ruling National Front coalition, bought out and dismissed the senior editorial staff of the two major Chinese-language dailies, Nanyang Press and Nanyang Siang Pau, effectively bringing the nation's most independent papers under government control. The takeover left only one independent Chinese daily, Sin Chew Jit Po. The Internet, which the government had pledged to spare from censorship, has also begun to come under government pressure. The government stepped up pressure on the online news daily Malaysiakini.com after it was alleged that the site had received start-up funding from a foundation controlled by U.S. businessman George Soros, whom Mahathir has branded an enemy of his country's financial system and responsible for the 1997 financial crisis. Although Malaysiakini denied the report, Mahathir told the nation that """"loyal Malaysians"""" should stop reading Malaysiakini and barred Malaysiakini reporters from attending government press conferences on the grounds that """"their credibility is doubtful."""" On May 23, the deputy home affairs minister told parliament that the government was monitoring """"every article"""" published by malaysiakini.com to ensure that its writings did not upset public order. Throughout the year, other government officials threatened that the site would be prosecuted if its reporting """"endangered national security."""" In May 2001, the prime minister's office announced that laws were being prepared to require online journalists to observe the same severe restrictions that impede the rest of the media. Civil servants are required to take an oath of loyalty to king, country and government. Academics and undergraduate students are also now required to take the pledge. The pledge, Akujanji (I Pledge), is an oath of good conduct and requires signatories to heed all existing and future government directives and orders. An explanatory note in a circular on the pledge reads: """"An officer who goes against or criticizes a government policy will undermine the integrity and stability of the civil service as a whole."""" The pledge is clearly intended to contain political activity among civil servants, academics and students. In October 2001, sixty-one university lecturers alleged to be engaged in anti-government activities were warned, transferred or fired. Civil servants are reportedly divided over the government's September 1998 arrest of former Deputy Premier Anwar Ibrahim, which sparked the reform movement. Last year, soon after Anwar's arrest, 10 reform activists and two student activists were detained under the ISA. The government has alleged that university student associations are controlled by the PAS. Mahathir has publicly admitted that the aim of the pledge is to check """"poisoning of the minds"""" of students so they """"stick to the original purpose of entering universities to gain knowledge and not to indulge in anti-government activities.""""","Asia, Malaysia","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

""""Now the Uzbek government must follow through on the committee's recommendations to stop the daily acts of torture committed by its officials.""""  On May 8, the U.N. Committee against Torture, a body of ten independent experts, published its conclusions and recommendations for Uzbekistan, following its periodic review of that country's compliance with the U.N. Convention against Torture. Uzbekistan became a party to the convention in 1995.  During its review, the committee expressed concern about the """"numerous, ongoing and consistent allegations of particularly brutal acts of torture by law enforcement personnel."""" The committee's conclusions and recommendations, issued last week, cited the """"numerous"""" convictions based on confessions and the use of the criterion of """"solved crimes"""" as the basis for promoting law enforcement personnel. These practices, it found, encourage the use of torture and ill treatment to force detainees to """"confess.""""  The committee's recommendations called upon the Uzbek government to:  · """"Review cases of convictions based solely on confessions in the period since Uzbekistan became a party to the Convention, recognizing that many of these may have been obtained through torture or ill-treatment, and, as appropriate, provide prompt and impartial investigation and take appropriate remedial measures"""";  · """"Ensure that those who complain of torture and their witnesses are protected from retaliation""""; · """"Ensure in practice absolute respect for the principle of the inadmissibility of evidence obtained by torture"""";  · """"Adopt measures to permit detainees access to a lawyer, doctor, and family members from the time when they are taken into custody, and ensure that doctors will be provided at the request of detained persons, rather than at the permission of prison officials"""";  · """"Improve conditions in prisons and pre-trial detention centers, and establish a system allowing for unannounced inspections of pre-trial detention centers and prisons by credible impartial investigators, whose findings should be made public"""";  · """"Take urgent and effective steps (i) to establish a fully independent complaints mechanism, outside the procuracy, for persons who are held in official custody, and (ii) to ensure prompt, impartial and full investigations into the many allegations of torture reported to the authorities, and the prosecution and punishment, as appropriate, of perpetrators.""""  Human Rights Watch has documented widespread torture and ill-treatment of detainees by law enforcement officials in recent years. Torture is regularly used in criminal investigations to compel detainees to confess or extract other testimony. It has become an unmistakable feature of the government's campaign against independent Islam, or those Muslims whose religious practices and affiliations fall beyond government-controlled Islam. In a report released in December 2000, Human Rights Watch detailed the methods law enforcement agents use, including asphyxiation and rape, to torture detainees, including those held on political and religious charges. The report found that police often threaten to torture detainees' family members, and sometimes abuse them in the presence of detainees. The report also described the stubborn pattern of impunity for those who commit acts of torture.  In an April 12 memorandum to the committee, Human Rights Watch documented several cases of torture, revealed in court hearings in March and April of this year, of individuals charged with alleged membership in the banned Islamic organization, Hizb ut-Tahrir. The U.N. committee also expressed concern about the lack of transparency in the Uzbek criminal justice system and the lack of statistics on detainees, complaints about torture, and investigations into such complaints. The government failed to provide the committee with requested information regarding the number of detainees and death penalty executions. The committee requested detailed information, for its next periodic review, on cases-both disciplinary and criminal-in which police and other law enforcement personnel were brought to justice for torture and related offenses.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","United Nations"

As part of his five-day visit to the island, Carter will hold several meetings with Cuban President Fidel Castro, and will also be allowed to address the Cuban people directly. On Tuesday evening, he will make a live, televised speech from the main auditorium of the University of Havana.  """"Carter has a rare and invaluable opportunity to speak to the Cuban people about human rights,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"For Cubans, unaccustomed to public statements on human rights -- much less a full, uncensored discussion of such questions -- the prospect of such a speech is exceptionally promising.""""  Visiting the island on the personal invitation of Cuban President Fidel Castro, Carter is the highest-profile U.S. figure to set foot in Cuba since Castro came to power in 1959. By traveling to the island and pursuing a dialogue with President Castro, he is implicitly criticizing the more than 40-year U.S. embargo on Cuba and the approach to Cuba policy that it represents.  Human Rights Watch pointed out that the expectations surrounding Carter's trip stem not only from the fact that he is the first U.S. president -- in or out of office -- to visit Castro's Cuba, but also from his prominence with regard to human rights. Having frequently raised human rights concerns during his presidency, making them a high-profile element of his foreign policy, Carter has real credibility on rights issues.  """"In Latin America, especially, Carter's name is virtually synonymous with human rights,"""" said Vivanco.  Human Rights Watch said former President Carter should use his meetings with President Castro to call on the government to release political prisoners, to ease restrictions on speech and assembly, to recognize the legitimacy of political opposition, and to grant access to Cuban prisons to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross.  """"But equally important - perhaps even more important - Carter should speak out forcefully on these issues before the Cuban public,"""" said Vivanco. """"During his televised address to the Cuban people, he could break new ground by mentioning political prisoners such as Oscar Elias Biscet and Francisco Chaviano Gonzalez by name.""""  Human Rights Watch compared Carter's trip to that of Pope John Paul II, who made dramatic public calls for political pluralism, religious freedom, and the release of political prisoners when he visited Cuba in 1998.  Cubans themselves, Human Rights Watch emphasized, have no opportunity to criticize their government's human rights policies in public. Not only does the Cuban government control what appears on television and in newspapers, Cuban laws impose stringent restrictions on speech under the guise of protecting state security. By enforcing broadly-worded prohibitions on """"enemy propaganda,"""" the spreading of """"unauthorized news,"""" and other speech offenses, the Cuban authorities keep the public discourse free of political viewpoints at odds with the government.  A closed society, Cuba also bars independent human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch from conducting routine research and advocacy visits to the island, a restriction that makes it unique in the Western Hemisphere. It has a deplorable track record with regard to U.N. human rights monitoring mechanisms, having denied access to the U.N. special rapporteur on Cuba for several years, until the rapporteur's mandate was finally discontinued.","Americas, United States, Cuba",""

We write to bring to your attention serious security concerns that Afghan women are presently facing. Attacks and threats to their physical safety are denying women the opportunity to exercise their basic human rights and to participate fully in the rebuilding of their country. As you know, the overthrow of the Taliban in November 2001 has led to greater freedom for women and girls in Afghanistan to participate in public life and to have access to education, health care, and employment. However, the continuing threat to security that women face in northern Afghanistan, and other areas of generalized insecurity, has in large measure rendered women's participation in public life almost impossible. Human Rights Watch has researched and reported extensively on Afghanistan, with recent research undertaken in February and March 2002. According to our research, the danger of physical assault is evident throughout northern Afghanistan, where ethnic Pashtuns have been specifically targeted for violence and harassment, including sexual violence. Human Rights Watch documented cases of sexual violence against Pashtun women perpetrated by the three main ethnically based parties and their militias in the north. Although Pashtun women in the north have been specifically targeted for sexual violence, Human Rights Watch researchers also gathered credible evidence of continuing politically or ethnically motivated sexual violence against women and girls of other ethnicities in Mazar-i Sharif, in northern Afghanistan.  This violence and insecurity has serious consequences for women in terms of their participation in the rebuilding of Afghanistan during this critical period. Afghan women in Mazar reported that they live under constant fears of physical assault and feel compelled to limit their movement, expression, and dress to avoid becoming targets of such violence by armed civilians or armed factions. Even in Kabul, where the presence of the 4,500 strong International Security Assistance Force has provided better security conditions than in the rest of the country, women are still hesitant about participating in public life. Human Rights Watch researchers were told of a number of incidents of harassment faced by women by armed factions and by those seeking to enforce repressive religious edicts. We are also concerned that women's representation and participation in the future government of Afghanistan could be undermined. On April 15, Afghanistan began the process of choosing its next government to replace the Interim Administration. One hundred and sixty women representatives are guaranteed seats in this process and others may be elected to non-reserved seats. However, women face considerable challenges in this process, which include entrenched traditional attitudes in Afghanistan constraining women from participating in political processes, as well as security concerns inhibiting women from traveling to regional centers to cast ballots.  In your radio address of November 17, 2001, you stated, """"our dedication to respecting and protecting women's rights in all countries must continue if we are to achieve a peaceful, prosperous, and stable world."""" We agree with this assessment and believe that a long-term engagement with Afghanistan by the international community, including the United States, is critical to ensure stability and sustainable reconstruction. In particular, we believe that the following recommendations are valuable first steps to enable Afghan women to participate in the reconstruction of their county.  - Support security arrangements for areas outside of Kabul and efforts to disarm commanders and forces that are implicated in war crimes or serious human rights violations. - Encourage funding for human rights monitoring in Afghanistan, and specifically provide direct financial and programmatic assistance to the Afghan Ministry for Women's Affairs. - Call on the Interim Administration to undertake public education campaigns to communicate its commitment to women's equality in all realms of Afghan society, including informing women about the appropriate government agencies to investigate instances of violence and discrimination against women.

Human Rights Watch also urged the IDF to take further action to stop the coerced use of Palestinian civilians during military operations, an issue the IDF said it would """"examine,"""" and reiterated its call for a full investigation into allegations of serious law of war violations committed by Israeli forces in Jenin. The Israeli army has taken an important step towards respecting the laws of war,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"But there are many other Israeli army practices that similarly violate international standards and require the same unequivocal and immediate action.""""  In response to a High Court of Justice petition by seven Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups, the Israeli army decided on May 9 to """"immediately issue an unequivocal order"""" to its soldiers, stating that soldiers """"are absolutely forbidden to use civilians of any kind as a means of 'living shield' against gunfire or attacks by the Palestinian side, or as 'hostages.'"""" The order states that the prohibition applies """"in houses, streets, and in every area and place in which IDF forces are acting."""" The Israeli army also committed itself to """"examine"""" the use of Palestinian civilians during military operations.  Human Rights Watch researchers met with senior IDF representatives on May 6, and presented them with detailed research on the use of Palestinian civilians as human shields and the coerced use of Palestinian civilians for military purposes, gaining a commitment from the IDF to investigate the practices and agreement that such practices would violate Israel's international obligations.  Human Rights Watch has reported extensively on the coerced use of Palestinian civilians during military operations, and most recently documented the use of Palestinian civilians as """"human shields"""" and for military purposes during the Israeli military operations in Jenin. In April 2002, Human Rights Watch released a report on the coerced use of Palestinian civilians by the IDF, entitled """"In a Dark Hour: The Use of Civilians during IDF Arrest Operations.""""  In its May 2 report entitled """"Jenin: IDF Military Operations,"""" Human Rights Watch documented several cases of IDF use of """"human shields,"""" including one case in which eight Palestinian men, including a fourteen-year-old boy, were taken from their homes and placed on a balcony overlooking Palestinian fighter positions while IDF soldiers fired from behind the men. In another case, IDF soldiers put a sixty-five-year-old Palestinian woman on the exposed roof of her home during a gun battle.  Prior to the May 9 Israeli army decision, rather than investigating the practice, Israeli army officials regularly issued blanket denials about the IDF's coerced use of civilians and the use of """"human shields."""" For example, in response to the April 2002 Human Rights Watch report on the coerced use of civilians, IDF spokesperson Isaac Greenburg told Agence France-Presse: """"Under no circumstances do we use, or will we ever use civilians to help us. The very idea, the very allegations are preposterous.""""  """"We hope that the Israeli army is finally moving beyond blanket denials and is now taking seriously its duty to investigate and stop abuses,"""" said Megally. """"It is the duty of any professional army to investigate abuses, punish those responsible, and issue unambiguous orders to the troops to stop.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

In particular, the two international human rights organizations strongly condemn the wave of racist attacks against Arabs and anti-Semitic attacks against Jews, and call on West European governments to redouble their efforts to combat racism in all its forms and to bring to justice suspected perpetrators of hate crimes. The recent increase in anti-Semitic attacks has unfolded in the wake of the Middle East crisis. They follow a general rise in racist and xenophobic violence in Western Europe, particularly against Arabs and certain ethnic and religious minorities, which spiked sharply in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks in the United States.  Recent anti-Semitic violence has included the posting of threatening hate mail, vandalizing of synagogues and Jewish cemeteries, and verbal abuse and physical assaults targeting Jews. The following examples highlight the rise in anti-Semitic violence in a number of West European countries:  · In France, hostility toward Jews has led to a particularly serious wave of attacks. The French police recorded 395 anti-Semitic incidents between 29 March and 17 April, 63 percent of which involved anti-Semitic graffiti. Between 1 January and 2 April, 34 """"serious anti-Semitic actions"""" were recorded; e.g. attacks on Jewish persons or property, including synagogues and cemeteries. In April, several synagogues, in Lyon, Montpellier, Garges-les-Gonesses (Val d'Oise) and Strasbourg were vandalized, while a synagogue in Marseille was burned to the ground. In Paris, a crowd threw stones at a vehicle transporting pupils of a Jewish school, and the vehicle's windows were broken. The authorities are now investigating these attacks.  · In the UK, at least 48 attacks on Jews were reported in April, compared with 12 in March, seven in February, 13 in January and five in December. Some of the assaults resulted in the hospitalization of victims with serious injuries. Reportedly, the victims were mainly orthodox and Hassidic Jews. In an April attack on a London synagogue, a swastika was scrawled on the lectern.  · In Belgium, synagogues in Brussels and Antwerp were firebombed in April; the facade of a synagogue in Charleroi, southwest Belgium, was sprayed with bullets. A Jewish bookshop and delicatessen in Brussels were destroyed by fire. Criminal investigations have been opened in these incidents, as well as into a physical assault on the Chief Rabbi of Brussels in December 2001.  · In April, synagogues were attacked in Berlin and Herford in western Germany. In the same month in Berlin, a young Jewish woman was reportedly attacked in the underground rail system because she was wearing a pendant of a Star of David. Two Orthodox Jews were attacked and slightly injured by a group of people on a shopping street after visiting a synagogue.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch both have monitored racist and xenophobic violence in Western Europe, including against Arabs and Muslims in the wake of the 11 September attacks in the United States. The international human rights organizations condemned these attacks, which have included verbal abuse, physical assaults and attacks on mosques-and express alarm that they continue. In an attack in Brussels on 7 May, a Moroccan immigrant couple was shot dead and two of their children wounded by an elderly Belgian neighbor, reportedly expressing racist views.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch welcome the 25 April statement by the European Union's Justice and Home Affairs Council """"condemning the racist acts perpetrated in various places in the E.U. in recent weeks."""" The Council urged joint EU action to combat discrimination and racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic violence, and to raise public awareness. In its statement, the Council also stated that preventive action should be taken against all forms of intolerance aimed at persons of the Jewish or Muslim faith or any other faith. Earlier in April, the interior ministers of France, the UK, Germany, Spain and Belgium issued a joint declaration against racism and anti-Semitism.  Government and political leaders in various countries have not only condemned the attacks, but some have also taken measures to provide protection to Jewish cultural and religious centres. In France over 1,100 extra police have been deployed to protect synagogues. In addition, authorities have opened judicial investigations and in some instances, convicted perpetrators of racist violence. The Belgian government stated on 1 April that it would expedite bringing to justice the perpetrators of such attacks and take all measures to ensure the security of places of worship. The police in London have stepped up their presence in Jewish areas and the Attorney General has promised a crackdown on racially motivated hate crimes.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch urge all West European governments to take immediate and effective measures to prevent racist and anti-Semitic violence; and to vigorously investigate, arrest, and prosecute perpetrators of such violence. We also call on governments to make public the measures they are taking to combat racist and anti-Semitic violence, and to report to the public periodically the results of these efforts.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, United Kingdom",""

The new law imposes exorbitant publishing fees that could handicap newspapers economically and silence new voices. Human Rights Watch urged President Daniel arap Moi not to sign the law into effect. The new law appears to be designed to mute public criticism in the run-up to national elections to be held by the end of this year. President Moi is stepping down after two decades in office, and the country’s constitution is under review.  “This measure could muzzle the press in a critical election year,”said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “Freedom of expression has never been more important in Kenya.”  Current Kenyan law already constricts publishers by requiring them to register with the government, pay a libel insurance bond, and submit copies of every publication to a government registrar. The new law passed by Parliament is an amendment to the Books and Newspapers Act and raises that bond amount one hundredfold, from US$128 to US$12,800. The law also penalizes vendors and distributors who don’t establish whether publishers of every publication they sell have registered and paid up. Penalties for a first offense include fines up to $12,800, three years in jail, or both.  “In effect, these fees could curb the right to freedom of expression,” said Takirambudde. “And that right is enshrined in international law and Kenya’s own constitution.”  The measure is an attempt to eradicate a proliferating “gutter press,” according to the government. But critics claim politicians are trying to cushion themselves from embarrassing revelations before the election. Journalists and media owners, who insist they can clean up the industry on their own, have drafted a code of ethics and are forming a regulatory council.  The latest media law follows a recent series of defamation and libel cases against newspapers and bookstores, in which high government officials, including President Moi, have won record damages.","Africa, Kenya","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Sexual violence by armed factions and public harassment tied to repressive Taliban-era edicts continue to restrict women in their movement, expression and dress, Human Rights Watch said in a new briefing paper released today. """"Women can only participate in the reconstruction of Afghanistan if they can be physically safe,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The international community must act now to end violence against women.""""  The 11-page briefing paper, """"Taking Cover: Women in Post-Taliban Afghanistan,"""" documents cases of attacks and threats against women that include rape and other acts of sexual violence and their effect on women's participation in civil society.  Since the end of Taliban rule in Afghanistan in November 2001, women and girls have had growing access to education, health care, and employment. At the same time, many Afghan women still live in an environment in which personal physical security is constantly under threat. The Human Rights Watch briefing paper documents a number of cases of sexual violence in the northern city of Mazar-i Sharif, including gang-rapes.  Many women continue to limit their movements and to wear a burqa, the head-to-toe enveloping garment, for their physical security, even though the Taliban-era edict requiring women to wear the burqa is no longer in force.  Human Rights Watch called on the international community to support the expansion of the mandate and duration of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF), increase funding for human rights monitoring in Afghanistan, and provide direct financial and programmatic assistance to the Afghan Ministry for Women's Affairs.  In addition, Human Rights Watch called on the Interim Administration, including local authorities, to take all possible steps to protect women from sexual and other gender-specific violence, and bring perpetrators to justice. Human Rights Watch also recommended that the Justice Ministry should repeal those laws that discriminate against women and are inconsistent with customary international law and international treaties to which Afghanistan is a party.","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

Glendening's decision today to impose a moratorium on executions in Maryland. Citing the need """"to be absolutely sure of the integrity"""" of the death penalty process, Governor Glendening announced the moratorium would continue until an ongoing University of Maryland study on racial bias and the death penalty is completed and reviewed and acted upon by the state legislature. The death penalty in Maryland, as elsewhere in the country, is plagued by arbitrariness, racial bias and the risk of executing the innocent,"""" said Jamie Fellner, Director of the U.S. Program at Human Rights Watch. """"We welcome the Governor's decision placing a moratorium on executions while there are doubts about the fundamental fairness of the capital punishment process."""" Nearly 70% of those on Maryland's death row are African-American. All but one were convicted of murdering white victims, even though the vast majority of murder victims in Maryland are African-American. The most immediate effect of the moratorium is to forestall the execution scheduled for next week of Wesley Eugene Baker, an African-American. Human Rights Watch, which opposes the death penalty in all cases, urged Governor Glendening to maintain the moratorium on executions at least until all the problems identified in the ongoing University of Maryland study are remedied. Glendening's announcement followed last month's release of a major study by the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment, which recommended dozens of reforms to reduce the risk of wrongful conviction and execution. The Illinois commission, however, also acknowledged that no system of criminal justice can guarantee absolutely that innocent persons will not be sentenced to death. Nine death penalty states currently have legislation pending that would impose moratoria on executions.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

Using such weapons, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP) has indiscriminately killed and injured numerous civilians and destroyed homes, schools, and churches.  The most recent of these attacks occurred on May 2, 2002, in Bojayá, Chocó. During a reported clash between the FARC-EP and paramilitary forces, civilians sought refuge in a local church. According to credible reports received by Human Rights Watch, at least one gas cylinder bomb fired by the FARC-EP forces struck this church, killing at least 117 civilians, including at least forty-eight children, and injuring at least 114 other civilians.  """"The FARC-EP is responsible for committing systematic atrocities against civilians,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The FARC-EP must immediately stop using gas cylinder bombs, because their use constitutes a serious violation of international humanitarian law.""""  Gas cylinder bombs are indiscriminate weapons impossible to aim with accuracy, and consequently often strike civilian objects and cause avoidable civilian casualties. International humanitarian law prohibits attacks on civilians and civilian objects. The use of gas cylinder bombs in a civilian area violates the international humanitarian law prohibition against indiscriminate attacks. Violations involving direct or indiscriminate attacks on civilians during an internal conflict are increasingly recognized internationally as war crimes.  In a twelve-page letter to Manuel Marulanda, the FARC-EP's commander-in-chief, Human Rights Watch documented the FARC-EP's use of gas cylinder bombs in at least twenty-seven attacks since July 2001, not including the recent attack in Bojayá, Chocó. At least twelve civilians were killed and forty-five others injured, including ten children, during these attacks. Gas cylinder bombs launched by the FARC-EP have caused severe damage to schools, churches, and civilian homes and places of work in Colombia.  Human Rights Watch reminded Marulanda that to use indiscriminate weapons violates one of the most basic principles of the laws of war, which requires that combatants be distinguished from noncombatants and that military objectives be distinguished from protected property or places.  Formally established in 1964, the FARC-EP is Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group. Although estimates differ, the FARC-EP is believed to have over 15,000 members and is active throughout Colombia. Marulanda was one of its original founders and now presides over the General Secretariat, the group's governing body.  """"As the most senior commander of the FARC-EP, Manuel Marulanda is responsible for the persistent human rights abuses committed by his forces,"""" said Vivanco. """"He bears the responsibility for ensuring that FARC-EP forces abide by international legal norms, and that is why we addressed him directly.""""  Human Rights Watch previously wrote to Commander Marulanda on July 10, 2001, urging him to stop his forces from committing a wide range of human rights abuses, including the use of prohibited weapons. Since then, however, the FARC-EP has not only continued to use gas cylinder bombs, but has escalated its use of them in blatant disregard for international humanitarian law.","Americas, Colombia","Children's Rights, Attacks on Education"

Similar strife during the early 1990s-by many of the same parties that are now in power locally-involved serious and widespread violations of the laws of war and paved the way for the rise of the Taliban. If the international community doesn't take more effective steps immediately to establish security throughout Afghanistan, the country is likely to return to the rampant human rights abuses and warlordism that characterized the last decade,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.N. Security Council and the United States-led coalition forces must live up to their commitment to ensure peace and stability throughout Afghanistan.""""  Heavy fighting broke out on April 29 near the northern city of Mazar-i Sharif, in the districts of Sar-e Pul and Sholgara. The fighting involved the two major parties in the region: Junbish-i Milli, the mainly ethnic Uzbek forces of Deputy Defense Minister Abdul Rashid Dostum, and Jamiat-e Islami, the mainly Tajik forces commanded in the north by Atta Mohammad, an ally of Defense Minister Mohammad Qasim Fahim. The conflict led to at least twenty deaths before the U.N. negotiated a cease-fire on May 2.  Human Rights Watch said violence could worsen as factions try to consolidate their control over territory and influence the loya jirga (grand national council) process now underway. Afghan civilians began holding district-level meetings throughout the country on April 15 to choose representatives to the assembly, which will meet in Kabul in June to select the country's next government.  The past week saw a massive buildup of troops and military hardware in Mazar-i Sharif by Junbish and Jamiat. As of May 5, up to 3000 troops from each faction were estimated to be in the city, with large numbers having entered on the pretext of taking part in National Day celebrations on April 28. Others continued to enter Mazar-i Sharif over the course of the last week, often in civilian dress and traveling on public buses. They were given arms when they reported to their factions' bases inside the city. International observers estimated that there are about ninety to one hundred armored vehicles in the city.  A second agreement brokered on Sunday by U.N. negotiators committed both factions to move their armored personnel carriers and artillery to their respective bases west and east of the city within twenty-four hours, and to dismantle unauthorized posts and bases. Observers told Human Rights Watch that the withdrawal of troops and military hardware was underway today, but that compliance would be difficult to monitor because many of the troops were housed in small groups in private homes. Yesterday's agreement also provides for an investigation by a U.N. commission into the fighting last week in Sholgara and Sar-e Pul, and authorizes such a commission to disarm both factions there.  Human Rights Watch strongly welcomed the agreement, but noted that the U.N. had limited capacity to monitor and enforce it.  """"The problems of warlordism and factional fighting are too widespread to be resolved by ad hoc interventions,"""" said Roth. """"Security arrangements are needed to counter the power of armed factions and create space for a civilian leadership to emerge.""""  Human Rights Watch has also learned of serious new outbreaks of factional fighting in other parts of the country.  ·Western Afghanistan: Human Rights Watch received reports on April 8 of fighting between Abdul Karim Barohi, the governor of Nimroz province, and rival commanders in areas adjacent to the Iranian border. Fighting was also reported in Saranj. In mid-April, fighting in the latter area forced the U.N. to temporarily halt repatriation of Afghan refugees from Iran. ·Southeastern Afghanistan: On April 27, heavy fighting broke out around Gardez for the second time this year between the Paktia provincial governor named by Chairman Hamid Karzai and an ousted warlord, Padshah Khan Zadran. At least twenty-five civilians were reported killed. ·Central Afghanistan: Human Rights Watch received reports on April 30 of fighting between three rival warlords in Wardak province, especially in Chak, Sayedabad, and Dai Mirdad districts.  Because the U.S.-led coalition forces have cooperated closely with many of the warlords and militias that now wield power in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said the coalition had a special obligation to promote disarmament and establish effective security arrangements for areas under their control. A 4,500- member international security assistance force (ISAF) has helped ensure security in Kabul, but the U.S. has not supported its expansion to other areas, and ISAF member countries are reluctant to contribute additional troops without explicit U.S. support.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

Some 70 heads of state arrive in New York this week to evaluate global progress for children and adopt a new plan of action. The plan has been under negotiation for more than a year, but focuses primarily on previous commitments, and offers weak follow-up mechanisms. """"Millions of children are today denied basic rights and suffer unconscionable abuse because governments have failed to live up to their commitments,"""" said Bill Bell of Save the Children UK, speaking on behalf of the Child Rights Caucus, a coalition of more than 100 national and international non-governmental organizations.  Over 125 million children are not in school; 250 million children are involved in child labor, including millions who are victims of sexual exploitation and trafficking; 2 million children have died in ten years and up to 25 million have been uprooted by armed conflict. 10 million children a year die from malnutrition and preventable diseases.  The two most controversial issues still being negotiated are related to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the rights of adolescents to sexual and reproductive health education and services. On both issues, the United States is a major obstacle to agreement.  """"The US has tried to sideline the Convention on the Rights of the Child as the global standard for protecting the rights of children,"""" said Jo Becker of Human Rights Watch. """"It is also seeking to roll back previous agreements to provide adolescents with sexual and reproductive health education and services.""""  The United States and Somalia are the only countries that have not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Since 1989, 191 countries have ratified the Convention, making it the most widely ratified treaty in history.  The Child Rights Caucus welcomed the Special Session's attention to protecting children from abuse, violence and exploitation, issues that were virtually ignored in 1990. But it criticized the mechanisms for follow-up and monitoring the Session's outcome document, which are too weak to ensure that governments were held accountable for their pledges. For example, the primary international monitoring body for children - the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child - had been given no addition support, even though it has already fallen way behind in reviewing governments' actions.  The Caucus said that an effective action plan was vital to make up for the """"broken promises"""" of the decade since the 1990 World Summit for Children, but criticized governments for failing to allocate adequate resources to children. During the 1990's, international development assistance fell to new lows, and developing countries allocated only 12-14 percent of national budgets to basic social services. Despite pledges to support universal access to education, only 2% of international aid goes to provide schooling in poor countries.  """"Promises are easily made,"""" said Becker, """"but the challenge for the next decade is to ensure that governments live up to their commitments. Without sufficient political will and resources, the stage is set for another decade of broken promises.""""

Human Rights Watch also urged the SPDC to fully respect the unconditional terms of Aung San Suu Kyi's release, and called on the United Nations and foreign diplomats to carefully monitor implementation of the agreement leading to her release.  Aung San Suu Kyi was arbitrarily detained on September 22, 2000, when she and other NLD members tried to board a train to the northern city of Mandalay. She was forcibly returned to her compound , and a number of other NLD supporters were also detained and later released. In October 2000, the military government began secret talks with Aung San Suu Kyi, facilitated by the U.N. Secretary General's Special Envoy, former Malaysian ambassador Razali Ismail.

""""We see here a triumph of ideology over any rational assessment of how to combat the worst human rights crimes.""""     In a May 3 letter to President George W. Bush, Roth urged him not to """"unsign"""" the treaty, saying that such an action could come back to haunt Washington if it encourages governments around the world to """"unsign"""" other treaties that they have not yet ratified.     The renunciation of U.S. signature appears certain to aggravate relations with the European Union and the emerging democracies who are among the court's strongest supporters. Many states that have made the transition from dictatorship to democracy, such as South Africa and Argentina, have already ratified the treaty and view the court as an important insurance policy against retrenchment.     In June 2001, the E.U. issued a Common Position expressing full support for the early establishment of the International Criminal Court, and encouraging the Bush administration to cooperate with the court. Other than the United States, 138 governments have signed the treaty and 66 have ratified it.     """"The timing of this decision couldn't be worse for Washington,"""" said Roth. """"It puts the Bush Administration in the awkward position of seeking law-enforcement cooperation in tracking down terrorist suspects while opposing an historic new law-enforcement institution for comparably serious crimes.""""","United States, US Foreign Policy, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Mr. Kishore Mahbubani President of the Security Council Permanent Representative of the Republic of Singapore to the United Nations  Your Excellency:  Human Rights Watch researchers have had a continuous presence in Afghanistan since early February, documenting the security situation across the country. In the last few weeks, Human Rights Watch has received increasingly troubling reports of deteriorating security in the north, southeast, south, and the west of the country. We are writing now to urge your government to support immediate measures in cooperation with the United States and other nations to address this growing insecurity and to guarantee the success of the December 2001 Bonn Agreement. Our recommendations include:  Supporting security arrangements for areas outside of Kabul;  Increasing civilian monitoring of human rights and the loya jirga process; and  Speeding efforts to disarm non-governmental factions. According to our research, heavy fighting broke out last week south of Mazar-e Sharif between the two major northern factions, led by the Deputy Defense Minister Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad, an ally of Defense Minister Fahim. More than twenty combatants were killed before a peace agreement was brokered by the U.N. Since then, Human Rights Watch has received confirmed reports of hundreds of troops from both factions entering the city to be rearmed. Heavy factional fighting has also been reported in recent weeks in areas adjacent to the Iranian border. These conflicts have forced the U.N. to halt the return of Afghan refugees to parts of Farah and Nimroz provinces. In the last two weeks, fighting between warlords in Gardez and Khost has killed at least twenty-five civilians and injured scores of others.  We note that ethnic minorities and women are especially vulnerable in this general climate of insecurity. Targeted attacks by armed factions - including looting, beatings, extortion, murder, and rape - have already uprooted thousands of ethnic Pashtuns in northern Afghanistan. Afghan women of all ethnicities have been compelled to restrict their participation in public life to avoid being targets of violence by armed factions and by those seeking to enforce repressive religious edicts.  The ongoing loya jirga process, which will culminate in the selection of a new government in June, is also in jeopardy. The abuses cited above suggest that military commanders and warlords may use intimidation and violence to keep minority or opposition candidates from participating in regional meetings or traveling to provincial election sites.  In meetings with officials from your government, the U.N., the United States, and other coalition partners, Human Rights Watch has found awareness of these security concerns and even of the need for a larger ISAF, but we have largely encountered resistance to actual expansion of ISAF. Many officials told us that the political will does not exist to supply the troops necessary for an expanded force, and that the United States specifically has blocked efforts to allow the force to be expanded.  The current debate, as we understand it, centers on how the U.N. and coalition partners can best improve security in Afghanistan by using the tools that are already on the ground - the """"tool box"""" approach. Security Council meetings over the last month have discussed such possible tools as:  Increased U.N. civilian affairs and human rights monitoring; Conditioning development aid so that factional leaders do not receive development assistance in their territory unless they maintain peace; Continuing use of the good offices of Mr. Brahimi and the U.N. mission; and Efforts by coalition forces to pressure warlords through threats or incentives. Human Rights Watch supports increased monitoring but we have concerns about the consequences and effectiveness of the other tools listed above. For example, efforts to channel developmental aid through warlords implicitly legitimate and reinforce their rule by undermining central authority. Such measures may in fact cause security to deteriorate. We also believe that these mechanisms, even if taken together, are not adequate for the job.  Long-term plans to reconstruct the Afghan police force and national army, which we support, cannot guarantee security in the critical short-term. Despite the technical assistance now being provided by various countries, both the police and army are still years away from being able to ensure security throughout the country.  We therefore urge you to consider new measures in cooperation with other nations to improve the security situation nationwide. We specifically call on you to promote measures that would allow an expansion of security forces (ISAF or otherwise) outside of Kabul.  We stress that these discussions need not proceed on an """"all or nothing"""" basis. Even if a nationwide security plan is not immediately feasible, various intermediary measures can be explored. These can include exploring region-by-region deployments, basing reconnaissance or rapid reaction forces in Kabul, and deploying existing coalition forces to improve security in effected areas.  Thank you for your consideration of these matters.  Sincerely,  Kenneth Roth Executive Director","Asia, Afghanistan","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/06/spain-and-morocco-abuse-child-migrants","Spain and Morocco Abuse Child Migrants","Spain and Morocco Abuse Child Migrants","Beatings, Summary Expulsions of Unaccompanied Children Commonplace","05/06/2002","Moroccan migrant children in Spain are frequently beaten by police and abused by staff and other children in overcrowded, unsanitary residential centers, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released today. Spain also summarily expels children as young as eleven to Morocco, where Moroccan police beat and ill-treat them and then abandon them to the streets. The sixty-two page report, """"Nowhere to Turn: State Abuses of Unaccompanied Migrant Children by Spain and Morocco,"""" documents widespread abuse of Moroccan children who travel alone to the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla, located on the North African coast. Human Rights Watch interviewed dozens of current and former migrant children during a five-week investigation in Spain and Morocco. Many children had been summarily expelled multiple times.  """"No one is caring for these children,"""" said Clarisa Bencomo, researcher in the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Spanish officials violate these migrant children's human rights in an effort to drive them back to Morocco, and Moroccan officials punish them for having left.""""  Conditions in two Spanish residential centers, the San Antonio Center in Ceuta and Purísima Concepción Fort in Melilla, were especially bad, with substandard facilities, serious overcrowding, and no recreational space or leisure-time activities for children. Children whom Human Rights Watch interviewed consistently testified that staff at these centers frequently beat and threatened them. Staff at the San Antonio Center operated a """"punishment cell"""" where they locked up children for up to a week without adequate bedding and sometimes without access to a toilet. Younger and smaller children reported being attacked or robbed by older or larger children at these centers while staff watched without intervening.  """"Children told us they felt safer living on the streets than in the overcrowded, dangerous residential centers Spain provides for their care,"""" Bencomo said.  Human Rights Watch charged that Spain denied education to the vast majority of unaccompanied migrant children in Ceuta and many children in Melilla, and that staff at both public health clinics and residential centers arbitrarily denied health care to ill and injured children in Ceuta.  Spanish law guarantees unaccompanied foreign children care and protection on the same basis as Spanish children, including the right to education, health care, temporary residency status, and protection from repatriation when repatriation would put the child in danger. Local officials in Ceuta and Melilla regularly disregard the law, arbitrarily denying children care and protection. Central government officials admitted they do not regularly monitor children's treatment or bring serious abuse cases to court. In many instances that Human Rights Watch investigated, the bodies charged with protecting children - the police and the Departments of Social Welfare - were the source of abuses.  """"The Spanish government says it cares about children's rights, but it does little if anything to enforce its own laws,"""" Bencomo said. """"Whenever we asked government officials what they were doing to protect children, they always claimed it was someone else's responsibility.""""  Spain expelled children from Ceuta and Melilla by handing them over to Moroccan police, who beat and ill-treated them. The Moroccan police then released the children onto unfamiliar streets, often late at night. Even very young children were left to fend for themselves because Morocco lacked adequate provisions for the protection of children living outside a family environment, and Moroccan authorities typically only intervened when a child was suspected of committing a serious criminal offense. Care in many Moroccan child detention centers was grossly inadequate, but judges had few alternatives to these facilities if they could not safely return a child to his or her family.  Human Rights Watch called on the Government of Spain to ensure that unaccompanied migrant children have access to residential care, education, emergency services and other health care, and temporary residency documents, as required by Spanish law. Residential centers for unaccompanied children should meet basic standards of health and safety and provide children the protection and care necessary for their well being. Spain should not repatriate or expel children unless the government has verified that the child is to be returned either to a family member who is willing and able to care for the child or to an appropriate social service agency in the child's country of origin, and that the child's return poses no risk or danger to the child's safety or to the safety of his or her relatives.  Human Rights Watch called on the Government of Morocco to facilitate the return to Morocco of unaccompanied migrant children when it is in the children's best interest and to provide resources for their care and protection, including designating a social welfare agency to receive unaccompanied migrant children who have been returned from Spain and, where appropriate, return them to their families. Morocco should protect unaccompanied migrant children who have been returned to Morocco from Spain from cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and other abuses at the hands of police.  The organization also called on both governments to work together to ensure that children are repatriated from Spain to Morocco only when they are returned to family members who are willing and able to care for them or to an appropriate social service agency.

But in recent years the commission has become a casualty of its own success. Stung by its criticisms, abusive governments have flocked to the commission in the hope of dampening its voice. Governments in Africa, Asia and the Middle East have elected commission members who increasingly resemble a club of outlaws, dedicated to protecting themselves from scrutiny rather than upholding human rights standards. This woeful evolution reached a new nadir during the session of the commission that closed on April 26 in Geneva. For the past two years Russia has flouted the commission's recommendations for curbing atrocities in Chechnya, so this year, instead of raising the ante, the commission voted to stop criticizing Russia. Hard-line elements in Iran are intensifying repression of reformists, so the commission voted to end scrutiny of Tehran. China's oppression has heightened in the face of growing popular discontent, so the commission didn't even propose condemning Beijing. Efforts to criticize Zimbabwe and Equatorial Guinea also failed. Resolutions were adopted condemning killings by Israel but saying little about suicide bombings by Palestinians. UN human rights investigators were reduced to token five-minute reports of their findings, while obscure visiting """"dignitaries"""" were permitted to drone on. Increasingly, what is at stake is not simply the credibility of the commission but the very tool of naming and shaming - the powerful process of stigmatizing governments that flout international standards. Instead, a rogue's gallery increasingly convinces a commission majority to opt for silence and indifference. No abuse, in the eyes of these governments, is too big to be ignored. Behind this assault on human rights enforcement is a virtual Who's Who of human rights violators, including Algeria, Burundi, China, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Libya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Togo and Vietnam. All have been voted full members of the commission. The European Union sometimes stood up to this Abusers' Defense Society, but its opposition was inconsistent and often halfhearted. Shamefully, no EU government on the commission introduced a resolution on China. For Austria, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Sweden, the visions of Chinese contracts were too strong to keep in mind the plight of Chinese victims. The EU also increasingly tried to replace resolutions condemning an abusive government with watered-down consensus statements to which even the targeted government would agree. When these efforts went nowhere, as occurred with Chechnya and Iran, it left insufficient time to rally support for a more critical approach. The United States was no better. A year ago it was voted off the commission for the first time, in part for its own inconsistent support for human rights. This year, lobbying from the sidelines, it predictably pressed for (and secured by a single vote) critical resolutions on Cuba and Sudan. But when it should have been campaigning for resolutions on Chechnya or China, it spent its energy undermining positive initiatives, such as a proposed treaty to inspect detention centers where torture occurs and a proposed resolution to prevent the war on terrorism from serving as a pretext for repression. Yet all is not bleak. Latin America, with its fresh memories of repressive rule, increasingly supported human rights initiatives. Mexico under President Vicente Fox especially stood out. Moreover, the commission's see-no-evil majority is a thin one. The resolutions on Chechnya and Iran failed by a single vote. Human rights proponents prevailed on the torture investigation treaty, new instructions for protecting gays and lesbians from summary execution, and a proposal to draft a new treaty on """"disappearances."""" But the commission is at a dangerous moment. To break the abusers' grip, Europe, the United States and other democracies must take a far more principled stand. A useful step would be to begin lobbying throughout the year for hard-hitting resolutions rather than make feeble efforts at the last minute. All governments which elect commission members should adopt rules that exclude at least the worst offenders - those whose records the commission has condemned, which have failed to implement commission recommendations, or which have refused to allow visits by commission investigators.","Global","United Nations"

Aung is 14 years old, and has already spent three years as a soldier. He was recruited when he was 11, and saw his first battle when he was 12. He's one of tens of thousands of children under the age of 18 in Burma's army, and one of more than 300,000 child soldiers worldwide. For Aung, this week's United Nations summit on children, the first such meeting in 10 years, may seem very remote - if he's aware of it at all. Aung is 14 years old, and has already spent three years as a soldier. He was recruited when he was 11, and saw his first battle when he was 12. He's one of tens of thousands of children under the age of 18 in Burma's army, and one of more than 300,000 child soldiers worldwide. Beginning Wednesday, some 70 heads of state will meet in New York to discuss the reality for Aung and other children around the world. This highest level international conference will evaluate governments' progress for children over the last 10 years, and adopt a new plan of action for the next decade. At the last world summit for children, in 1990, governments agreed on key goals, such as reducing infant mortality by one-third, ensuring universal access to education, providing all children with safe drinking water and improving protections for children affected by war and exploitation. In the end, 155 countries adopted national plans of action. But, based on their performance, Aung and many other children would give most of these governments poor marks. UN statistics show that 10 million children a year die from malnutrition and preventable diseases; 125 million are out of school; 250 million children under the age of 15 are involved in child labor, including millions who have been trafficked or drawn into the commercial sex trade. Armed conflict has cost the lives of more than 2 million children in 10 years and driven 25 million from their homes. The AIDS pandemic has orphaned 10 million children under age 15. Forty million children each year are not even registered at birth. The picture is grim, and many governments have failed to live up to the promises they made in 1990. Some have actively committed abuses against children, such as Burma, which recruits children by the thousands for its military, while others have simply stood by and failed to act. For many countries, rich and poor alike, children are simply not a priority. Developing countries invest only 12 percent to 14 percent of their national budgets in basic social services such as health care and education, and development aid from wealthier countries dwindled to new lows during the 1990s. Despite pledges to support universal access to education, only 2 percent of world foreign aid goes to provide schooling for children in poor countries. This week's summit is a chance to put children back on the agenda and recommit both resources and political will to ensure their rights. Government's summit will set revised targets for health and education and adopt new goals in response to the more recent challenges of HIV/AIDS and the increased awareness of problems like child soldiering, child labor, trafficking of children and sexual exploitation. For the United States, this should be an occasion to demonstrate international leadership on behalf of children. But instead, the summit will highlight an unfortunate distinction that the U.S. shares with only one other country: its failure to ratify the UN's most comprehensive statement on children's rights, the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Although the Clinton administration signed the document in 1995, Senate leaders warned that they would never ratify it and it has yet to come up for a vote. The convention was adopted by the United Nations just weeks before the 1990 World Summit on Children, and has been ratified by 191 countries, making it the most widely and rapidly ratified treaty in history. It sets the international standard with regard to treatment of children, and in contrast to goals set at global summits like this week's, its provisions are legally binding on governments that ratify it. The only other holdout? Somalia. What could be so objectionable about a treaty to support the rights of children? Read with a balanced eye, the convention can hardly be considered a threat to American values. It obligates governments to consider the best interests of the child, to provide children with access to education and health care and to protect them from discrimination, sexual and economic exploitation and other abuse. Under the Reagan and first Bush administrations, the State Department participated actively in the 10-year drafting of the convention, proposing key articles designed to prevent child abuse, and to protect freedom of religion, expression and association. All of these concepts were included in the convention. Unfortunately, the treaty has fallen victim to a smear campaign by those who paint it as a threat to parental authority. Organizations such as the Christian Coalition, Focus on the Family and Concerned Women for America have lobbied Congress to oppose it. They fear that promoting the rights of children will interfere with the ability of parents to raise and, when necessary, discipline their children. For example, a provision in the convention referring specifically to cases of child abuse or neglect has been interpreted as giving governments the authority to arbitrarily remove children from their homes. The critics have characterized the convention as """"the most insidious document ever signed by an American president,"""" """"the most dangerous attack on parents' rights in the history of the United States"""" and a """"tool for perverts."""" In reality, the convention instructs governments to """"respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents"""" and support families in their efforts to raise and care for their children. References to the importance of the parent-child relationship appear throughout the text. Nevertheless, the well-organized and well-funded opposition has left the treaty with few supporters in Washington. Another hurdle here is the convention's prohibition of the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18. Twenty-two U.S. states allow the death penalty for juvenile offenders. In the last three years, five individuals have been executed in the United States for crimes they committed before the age of 18, and two more executions are scheduled in the next month. During that same period, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iran were the only other countries in the world known to have carried out such executions. The U.S. opposition to the convention has been a key obstacle in the negotiations for this week' s UN special session. While other governments see the treaty as the logical starting point for any international action plan for children, the Bush administration's delegation has tried to weaken references to the convention in any plan that emerges, and to remove references to the rights of children. It has opposed any mention of the death penalty. At the same time, the administration is being criticized for trying to roll back international agreements to provide adolescents with sexual and reproductive health education and services. Soon, however, the United States will take two very positive steps. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is considering two international treaties. One prohibits the commercial sexual exploitation and sale of children, and is intended to help millions of children who have been drawn into child prostitution, used for pornography or sold into slave-like conditions. The other focuses on the use of child soldiers and prohibits the forced military recruitment of children under age 18, or their use in armed conflict. Both are expected to be ratified in the Senate this year, possibly in the next few weeks. While U.S. support for these treaties is welcome and important, its position on the Convention on the Rights of the Child remains an international disappointment. Representatives for the Bush administration have asserted the U.S. commitment to addressing the problems of children worldwide, and claim that U.S. legal protections for children are among the strongest in the world. Yet, there's something wrong when the U.S. purports to champion children, but hasn't bothered to join the most universally ratified treaty in history written on their behalf.","Global","Children's Rights, United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/05/03/dont-unsign-icc-treaty","Dont Unsign the ICC Treaty","Don't """"Unsign"""" the ICC Treaty","Letter to President Bush","05/03/2002","President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500    Dear President Bush:  On April 11th, the 60th ratification of the Rome Treaty on the International Criminal Court (ICC) was deposited at the United Nations. By early next year, the first permanent international court designed to prosecute the world's most terrible crimes will begin its work. Virtually every major U.S. ally is joining this institution without reservation. Their embrace of the ICC is rooted in the lessons of a century scarred by genocide, from the Holocaust to Cambodia, from Rwanda to Iraq. At long last, there will be a place where the victims of such evil crimes will be heard and the perpetrators held accountable.   We know that your administration opposes ratifying the ICC Treaty. Yet the United States still faces a stark choice. Even as a non-state party to the ICC, it can engage constructively with its allies to ensure a fair and impartial tribunal. Or it can disengage entirely, throwing away its influence for absolutely no gain. It can uphold its legacy of leadership in bringing war criminals to justice. Or it can needlessly undermine that legacy in the eyes of the world.   Ever since September 11th, the United States has been leading a global effort against the perpetrators of a massive crime that targeted innocent civilians. To strengthen respect for human rights and extend the rule of law, we urge you not to withdraw U.S. signature from the ICC Treaty. This is an unprecedented step - in 225 years the United States has never removed its signature from an international treaty. Such a step will not derail the ICC or deter a single country from joining it. """"Unsigning"""" the treaty or actively opposing the court will only isolate the United States from friends and allies committed to the rule of law and undercut America's standing as a country committed to international justice.   We recognize your administration's concern that the ICC could be misused to launch politically motivated legal attacks against American citizens. But the ICC contains more safeguards against such prosecutions than any international court yet established. Unlike the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, for example, the ICC will have no jurisdiction over alleged crimes investigated in a good faith manner by governments, something the United States is committed to do as a matter of course when credible charges are brought against its citizens. The ICC can act only when countries willfully obstruct justice - a very high bar.   The ICC will have authority to try only the worst international crimes, defined in ways that correspond to the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice. Suspects will enjoy due process rights as comprehensive as those guaranteed by the U.S. Bill of Rights - indeed, stronger than those afforded by many countries to which the United States extradites its nationals. American service members will gain added protection from Status of Forces agreements negotiated with countries where they are based, which take precedence over obligations to the ICC. If a potential adversary ever tried to bring a case against an American before the court, he would automatically expose himself to prosecution as well for any crime related to the same conflict.   These are strong protections, written into the ICC Treaty in large part at the insistence of American negotiators. If the court's judges were ever to ignore them, they would have to answer to an Assembly of States Parties composed mostly of American allies.   For all these reasons, it is hard to imagine a frivolous case involving an American citizen being taken seriously, much less prosecuted, by the ICC. That said, the court's potential jurisdiction over crimes committed by Americans on the territory of its member states is nothing extraordinary. Americans, including American service members, who commit crimes overseas are routinely tried in foreign courts. Those nations ratifying the Rome Treaty are simply exercising their right to transfer to an international court cases arising on their territory. This is not a threat to sovereignty, but an assertion of sovereignty.   Of course, the strength of the protections contained in the ICC Treaty will ultimately depend on their application by the court's judges and prosecutor. The first few years of the ICC's operation will be critical to shaping its culture. Its first judges and prosecutor will soon be named. Critical decisions, such as defining the crime of aggression, must still be made. Constructive engagement with the ICC will enable the United States to consult with its allies on these issues.   It will also allow your administration to cooperate with the court on a case-by-case basis when it takes up cases the United States has an interest in pursuing. Please keep in mind that once the ICC is established, the Security Council will not approve any additional ad hoc war crimes tribunals. The ICC will be the only available international mechanism for bringing future war criminals to justice. It would make little sense for the United States to oppose Security Council referrals of egregious crimes to the court, or to refuse to provide evidence when a perpetrator of genocide is brought before it.   Unsigning the ICC Treaty, on the other hand, would have no practical impact on the court and it would not gain a single additional protection for U.S. nationals. The cost would be felt almost entirely by the United States, which would lose all remaining standing in a process that clearly affects its interests.   Unsigning would also set a new international precedent that could come back to haunt the United States. It is not uncommon for governments to sign treaties even when there is no political consensus in their countries to ratify them - the United States often urges governments to do just that. It took Russia seven years and a change of leadership to ratify the START II nuclear arms treaty after Presidents Bush and Yeltsin signed it in 1993. It took Colombia six years to ratify the UN Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs. It took the United States forty years to ratify the Genocide Convention - from the time of President Truman, who signed it, to the time of President Reagan. Had the option of unsigning occurred to domestic opponents of these treaties, national leaders would have come under extraordinary pressure to repudiate the signatures of their predecessors. If you set this precedent today, you and other heads of state and government will be pressed to apply it to a host of other unratified treaties.   Ultimately, when the ICC has a proven track record of fair and impartial prosecutions against the Pol Pots and Saddams of the future, we are confident that the United States will want to reevaluate its hostility towards the court. In the meantime, the Unites States should neither burn its bridges nor foreclose its options. Engagement with this historically important institution is the one way for America to protect its interests while staying true to its values. We hope that is the choice you will make.

Human Rights Watch did not find evidence to support claims that the IDF massacred hundreds of Palestinians in the camp. In its forty-eight page report, """"Israel, the Occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the Palestinian Authority Territories: Jenin: IDF Military Operations,"""" Human Rights Watch identified fifty-two Palestinians who were killed during the operation, of whom twenty-two were civilians. Many of the civilians were killed willfully or unlawfully. Human Rights Watch also found that the IDF used Palestinian civilians as """"human shields"""" and used indiscriminate and excessive force during the operation.  """"The abuses we documented in Jenin are extremely serious, and in some cases appear to be war crimes,"""" said Peter Bouckaert, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and a member of the investigative team. """"Criminal investigations are needed to ascertain individual responsibility for the most serious violations. Such investigations are first and foremost the duty of the Israeli government, but the international community needs to ensure that meaningful accountability occurs.""""  A Human Rights Watch team of three experienced investigators spent seven days in the Jenin refugee camp, gathering detailed accounts from victims and witnesses and carefully corroborating and independently crosschecking their accounts with those of others to reconstruct a detailed picture of events in the camp in April 2002. The IDF has not agreed to Human Rights Watch's repeated requests for information regarding its military incursions into the West Bank and Gaza.  Bouckaert, who headed up earlier Human Rights Watch investigations into wartime abuses in Chechnya, Kosovo, and Afghanistan, said that the Jenin events clearly warrant further investigation. He noted that the hallmark of a professional army is to take seriously the need to establish accountability for serious violations of the laws of war.  """"There have been widely divergent accounts of what happened in Jenin. A U.N. fact-finding mission could contribute significantly to the search for the truth in Jenin,"""" Bouckaert said. """"Israel should cooperate fully with whatever new U.N. fact-finding mission might be established, and there should be no immunity for persons implicated in the most serious violations of the laws of war.""""  On April 3, 2002, the IDF launched a major military operation in the Jenin refugee camp, home to some fourteen thousand Palestinian refugees. An estimated eighty to one hundred armed Palestinians took part in the fighting. Israel claims the camp had been the launching ground for many of the suicide bombings that have killed and maimed over one hundred Israeli civilians in recent months. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned this deliberate killing of civilians. Palestinian armed militants had also planted many explosive devices in the camp prior to and during the IDF incursion.  Among the twenty-two civilian deaths documented during this investigation were the following:  Fifty-seven-year-old Kamal Zghair, a wheelchair-bound man who was shot and then run over by IDF tanks on April 10 as he was moving in his wheelchair equipped with a white flag down a major road in Jenin;  Thirty-seven-year-old Jamal Fayid, a paralyzed man, who was crushed in the rubble of his home on April 7 after IDF soldiers refused to allow his family the time to remove him from their home before a bulldozer destroyed it;  Fourteen-year-old Faris Zaiben, who was killed by fire from an IDF armored car as he went to buy groceries when the IDF-imposed curfew was finally lifted on April 11; and  Fifty-two-year-old 'Afaf Disuqi, who was killed on April 5 by an explosive charge that IDF soldiers had placed at her front door as she went to open it for the soldiers; In one case involving a wounded Palestinian militant, IDF soldiers for several hours prevented medical help from reaching him. The soldiers then killed the man, who had been left close to a hospital near the camp and was no longer armed or taking active part in the fighting.  Human Rights Watch also found evidence of indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force by the IDF. U.S.-supplied helicopters fired anti-tank missiles and other ordinance into the camp, in some cases making insufficient efforts to identify legitimate military targets and avoid hitting civilian houses. The helicopters struck many houses in Jenin refugee camp that were inhabited only by civilians, and where no Palestinian fighters were present. In one of many such cases, a tank shell and two helicopter-fired TOW anti-tank missiles hit the house of Kamal Tawalba, a father of fourteen children, on April 6. No fighters were present in the home. When Tawalba and his family tried to leave their burning home, IDF soldiers in the vicinity shot at them.  In another case, a sixty-year-old woman was killed when a helicopter fired a missile directly into her top-floor apartment although there were no armed Palestinians in the building or the immediate vicinity.  The IDF's campaign caused extensive and disproportionate destruction of the civilian infrastructure of the camp, particularly in the Hawashin district following an April 9 ambush of Israeli soldiers there. In contrast to other parts of the camp where armored bulldozers were used mainly to widen streets, in Hawashin they razed the entire district. Throughout the camp, at least 140 buildings were completely leveled, many of them multi-family dwellings, and more than 200 others were severely damaged, leaving an estimated 4,000 people, more than a quarter of the population, homeless. More than one hundred of those buildings were in Hawashin district.  The extensive, systematic, and deliberate leveling of the entire district was clearly disproportionate to any military objective that Israel aimed to achieve. Establishing whether this devastation so exceeded military necessity as to constitute wanton destruction-a war crime-should be one of the highest priorities for any future U.N. fact-finding team, said Bouckaert.  Human Rights Watch also documented cases in which Israeli troops used Palestinian civilians as human shields, a practice prohibited under international humanitarian law. In one case, IDF soldiers forced eight civilians to shield them by making them stand on a balcony while the soldiers fired at Palestinian gunmen. Kamal Tawalba and his fourteen-year-old son were among them. Tawalba described how the soldiers kept them for three hours in the line of fire, and used his and his son's shoulders to rest their rifles as they fired.  """"Even accepting the Israeli charge that Palestinian groups who used the refugee camp as a base were responsible for attacking Israeli civilians,"""" said Bouckaert, """"this does not excuse the IDF violations documented in this report."""" Bouckaert added that Human Rights Watch found no evidence that Palestinian gunmen forced civilians to serve as human shields during the battles in the camp, and no indication that Palestinian gunmen had prevented Palestinian civilians from leaving the camp.  """"As in our prior investigations of IDF operations, we also found numerous cases where the IDF coerced Palestinian civilians to take part in military operations,"""" Bouckaert said. """"Palestinian civilians were forced, sometimes at gunpoint, to accompany IDF troops during their searches of homes and to carry out some of the most dangerous tasks during these searches.""""  During most of """"Operation Defensive Shield,"""" the IDF blocked emergency medical access to Jenin camp. Soldiers repeatedly fired on Red Crescent ambulances, and in one case shot to death a uniformed nurse, twenty-seven-year-old Farwa Jammal, who had come to the assistance of a wounded man. In another case, fifty-eight-year-old Mariam Wishahi died in her home thirty-six hours after she was injured by shrapnel; IDF soldiers repeatedly prevented ambulances from reaching her home, located just a few hundred meters from Jenin's main hospital.  During the period the IDF had control of the camp, the Israeli authorities had responsibility under international humanitarian law for the welfare of the civilian population. Yet Israeli authorities denied humanitarian organizations access to the camp during their offensive, and continued to prevent humanitarian access to the refugee camp for days after military operations had ceased, despite great need.  Human Rights Watch has investigated and reported on violations of international humanitarian law by governments and armed groups in conflict situations around the globe, including most recently in Kosovo, Bosnia, Chechnya, eastern Congo, Indonesia, Afghanistan, and Colombia. Human Rights Watch is preparing a separate report on those responsible for suicide bombings directed against Israeli civilians.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

Action to end impunity should be a pre-condition for any aid to prepare for next year's national elections, Human Rights Watch said. The report includes a detailed case study of two politically motivated killings that took place in Kompong Cham province in November 2001, which were followed by a sustained campaign of intimidation against opposition members. The cases, which show the clear impact of political violence on voters and candidates, are scheduled to go to trial in Kompong Cham on May 2.  """"The trial is a key test case for Cambodian justice,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The government must show that political violence will be punished. Otherwise, how can there be free and fair parliamentary elections next year?""""  Human Rights Watch called on the Cambodian government to institute mechanisms to promptly respond to reports of political violence in advance of national elections scheduled for July 2003, in order to deter the kind of violence and intimidation that characterized the commune elections in many parts of the country.  When Cambodia's donors meet in Phnom Penh on June 19-21 for their annual meeting convened by the World Bank, they should insist that the government: Takes concrete steps to end impunity for perpetrators of political violence; Ensures the safety of candidates and voters; Reforms the National Election Committee to prevent control by any political party and strengthens its procedures for investigating and penalizing electoral offences; Takes steps to ensure that the voting cannot be manipulated; and Establishes independent new mechanisms to ensure full and unfettered access to broadcast media to all political parties during election campaigns. The run-up to the February 3 polls saw at least 275 reports of intimidation, threats and harassment, almost exclusively directed against candidates and supporters of parties running against the incumbent Cambodian People's Party (CPP), including twenty-four death threats. Fifteen opposition party members and commune council candidates were killed between January 2001 and January 2002, with the violence clearly increasing as the election drew near.  """"While polling day itself was relatively peaceful, unfortunately the same cannot be said for the pre-election period,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Political violence, intimidation, voter coercion and vote-buying started even before voter registration, and continued right through to the eve of the election.""""  Trials held in February 2002 in two of the political killings resulted in jail sentences for the accused, but in neither case was a political motive accepted for the crime. In addition, trial observers criticized the fact that a key suspect was not apprehended in one of the cases, and the lack of evidence against perpetrators in another.  The mechanisms put in place by the government to deal with election violations and political violence proved wholly inadequate, Human Rights Watch said. The National Election Committee and the Central Security Office for the Defense of the Elections did not once exercise their considerable powers to punish perpetrators of electoral abuses, despite hundreds of reports flooding in to Cambodian rights organizations.  The Double Political Killing in Kompong Cham On November 14, 2001, Sam Rainsy Party member Phoung Sophat was shot dead outside his home in Sralop commune, Tbong Khmum district of Kompong Cham. Two hours later, Funcinpec election candidate Thon Phally was shot dead in the same commune. For months afterwards, opposition candidates and their families in Tbong Khmum were terrorized by nighttime visits from gangs of armed men.  The indicted suspect in both killings, Ien Saveth, is deputy chief of a neighboring commune and the son of the Sralop commune chief. On May 2, 2002, he faces trial along with the deputy police chief of Sralop commune, who is also the former chief of the commune militia. Police and military have failed to apprehend two further suspects - a former militiaman and a sergeant in the district military - who are set to be tried in absentia.  """"Without progress in this and other outstanding cases, the prospects for free elections in 2003 and beyond look bleak,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Arms Embargo","Liberian Government Forces and Rebels Committing War Crimes ","05/01/2002","(New York) - The United Nations Security Council should maintain the arms embargo against the Liberian government, Human Rights Watch said in releasing a new report about abuses in Liberia today. Human Rights Watch also called for the arms embargo to be extended to cover the rebel Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), and for an end to Guinea’s support for the LURD. The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote on the arms embargo by May 7.  The 23-page report, “Back to the Brink: War Crimes by Liberian Government and Rebels, A Call for Greater International Attention to Liberia and the Sub Region” provides compelling evidence that Liberian government forces fighting against the LURD are committing war crimes and other serious human rights abuses against civilians in the northwest of the country.  “Liberian civilians are once again bearing the brunt of a brutal war,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “If the international community does not prevent further bloodshed, Liberia’s war will destabilize the wider region.”  The Liberian army and government militias have executed scores of civilians, including dozens whom they confined to houses and later burned to death. They have also carried out widespread rape of women and girls, some as young as twelve, and systematically looted and burned villages. Hundreds of men and some boys have been forcibly conscripted and sent to the battlefront in an arbitrary manner, often without proper training. LURD forces, which first attacked in July 2000, have also carried out serious abuses, although to a lesser extent, including summary executions of alleged government collaborators, rape, and forced recruitment, including of children.  Takirambudde said the fragile peace in Sierra Leone could easily be upset as a result of spillover from the renewed Liberian war, as growing numbers of Liberian refugees and combatants cross into neighboring countries. With peace coming to Sierra Leone, hundreds of former fighters from all sides of Sierra Leone’s civil war are crossing into Liberia to fight as mercenaries either for the Liberian government or for LURD.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern at the destabilizing role the government of Guinea is playing in providing logistic and some military support to the LURD. The United States, which will begin dispensing U.S.$3 million in military assistance to Guinea in May 2002, should condition its aid on an end to Guinea’s assistance for rebel activity in Liberia, Human Rights Watch said.  Over the past decade, the governments of the Mano River Union—Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—have frequently harbored each other’s rebel groups and supported cross-border incursions, causing widespread instability. Charles Taylor, both as former warring faction leader and as president of Liberia since 1997, bears primary responsibility for much of the long-standing aggression and serious human rights abuses in the sub-region, both in Liberia and in particular through his support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone.  In the face of renewed rebel action and negative international publicity, the Taylor government, which took power after a seven-year civil war, has become increasingly intolerant of dissent. Since a state of emergency was imposed in February 2002, the government has carried out a spate of arrests, closed newspapers, and detained and tortured human rights activists, clearly to silence criticism. Citing the rebel threat, the government is remilitarizing society—remobilizing ex-combatants and proliferating militia groups.  Human Rights Watch said that the international community must act immediately to pressure the Liberian government and rebels to respect human rights, and take steps to end Guinea’s support to the Liberian rebels","Africa, Liberia","Arms, United Nations"

By law, the State Department must certify the Colombian government on three human rights conditions before releasing the first tranche of military aid for fiscal year 2002, an estimated $104 million dollars. The three organizations recognize that U.S. officials have taken the certification process seriously. U.S. officials have met with human rights groups and appear to have pressured the Colombian government for human rights progress over the last three months. However, the Colombian government has not made progress toward meeting the conditions, such as the suspension of high-ranking military officers implicated in serious abuses or the arrest of known human rights violators. In short, the Colombian government has rebuffed benchmarks provided by the U.S. government to demonstrate meaningful human rights progress.  The State Department's decision was made despite abundant evidence demonstrating that little progress has been made in improving Colombia's dire human rights record.  Despite the suspension of some low-ranking officers, the Colombian Armed Forces have refused to act on notorious cases such as that of General Rodrigo Quiñones. Although it may appear that some progress was made regarding military cooperation with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities, the information was provided by the office of the Attorney General, which has over the past several months fired human rights prosecutors and put obstacles in the way of investigating high-ranking members of the Armed Forces. The Department of State has also recognized the inadequacies of the Attorney General's office. Contrary to the Department of State's assertions that effective measures have been taken to break links between the Colombian Armed Forces and illegal paramilitary groups, the certification provides no evidence of arrests or actions against key paramilitary leaders or high-ranking members of the Armed Forces credibly alleged to have collaborated with paramilitary groups. The human rights situation in Colombia continues to deteriorate, as all illegal armed groups continue to target primarily civilians. In only the first four months of 2002, numerous human rights defenders have been killed. Others who face extreme danger include trade unionists, journalists, community leaders and political candidates.  The groups also note serious setbacks, among them the release late last year of the only top paramilitary leader in custody in Colombia, Víctor Carranza. Dozens of Colombia's special human rights prosecutors have been forced to request special protective measures from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights or flee Colombia because of threats on their lives.  They were particularly concerned that the case of General Quiñones was cited by the State Department as an example of progress because he was transferred to a post in a foreign embassy. Quiñones has been implicated in the Chengue and El Salado massacres as well as the murder of fifty-seven trade unionists, human rights workers, and community leaders.  Human Rights Watch Americas Director José Miguel Vivanco points out: """"The administration is proposing millions in counter-terrorism aid to Colombia even as the Colombian military refuses to break ties with a designated terrorist group.""""  WOLA Executive Director Bill Spencer commented, """"Many of the human rights cases under discussion have languished without progress for the past few years and some for over a decade. This fact speaks to the lack of progress on all three conditions. The decision to certify Colombia on human rights misrepresents the facts in order to keep the aid spigot open.""""  Alex Arriaga, Government Relations Director for Amnesty International USA, issued the following statement: """"It is inexcusable for the United States to send military aid when the Colombian government has failed to adequately meet the human rights conditions placed upon U.S. aid. In 2001, there was a dramatic increase in political violence and attacks on human rights defenders.  Meanwhile, impunity continues to reign for those who violate human rights, whether they are the Colombian military, paramilitary groups, the FARC, or the ELN. Without progress on meeting the benchmarks, U.S. aid will only contribute to more human rights violations and diminish hopes for peace.""""","Americas, Colombia",""

In the past two weeks, police in Tashkent and the Ferghana Valley have detained dozens of women. Some stand accused of membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir, a banned Islamic group, and others have relatives who are in jail for their religious affiliations.  """"The authorities in Uzbekistan have already detained thousands of men for their affiliation with peaceful Islamic groups,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Now they're rounding up women.""""  On April 23, police broke up two protests by several dozen women in Tashkent's old city and in Margilan, a city in the Ferghana Valley. The women were protesting the state's harsh actions against independent Muslims. Many were also demanding the release of their male relatives who are serving prison terms for their religious affiliations. In Tashkent, police detained between nine and eighteen women and their children, including babies. Journalists and others who witnessed the incident told Human Rights Watch that officers descended upon the group, herded many of the protesters onto buses, and took them to an undisclosed location. Police disbanded the other demonstrators. In Margilan, police detained at least nine women and dispersed about forty-five others.  Authorities currently require scores of overtly pious Muslim women, particularly those who wear headscarves partially covering their faces, to sign monthly or even weekly statements pledging not to participate in unauthorized meetings or gatherings and not to join any """"religious sects."""" Until recently, however, few women had been arrested.  """"We've seen a steady rise in the number of people, particularly women, willing to risk the enormously dangerous move of peacefully voicing their dissent,"""" said Andersen. """"The latest round of detentions shows that the government does not intend to relent on the campaign against independent Islam.""""  Uzbekistan is a predominately Muslim country, where the government closely regulates religion. Some Muslims practice Islam beyond state controls.  The government has intensified its efforts against women who are alleged members of Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), an Islamic group that calls for the peaceful reestablishment of the Caliphate in Central Asia. Uzbek authorities routinely prosecute those accused of affiliation with the group on charges of anti-state activities or possession or distribution of """"illegal religious materials.""""  Human Rights Watch observed two recent trials of women charged with Hizb ut-Tahrir membership. The first, involving four women-Aiazimkhon Yakbalkhojaeva, Tursunoi Rashidova, Arofat Khakimova, and Lazokat Avazova-continues this week in Tashkent. According to the defendants, the court failed to give them adequate advance notification of the trial date in which to communicate with legal counsel and prepare a defense, and instead summoned several of them by phone in early April just an hour before the hearing was due to begin. The prosecution gave the defendants a copy of the indictment against them only after several days of trial hearings. The defendants had no prior notification of the charges they faced.  The second trial, also in Tashkent, concluded on April 24 with four women convicted for membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir: Nasiba Uzakova; Nargiza Usmanova; Mukhtabar Omonturdieva; and Fatima Khamroboeva. The women testified that their religious activities consisted of meeting privately for prayer and Islamic study. One of the women testified in court that police beat them or threatened physical violence to coerce confessions and to """"punish"""" them for their activities. Sentences ranged from two years of probation to four years of imprisonment. These are relatively lenient terms in Uzbekistan, where an estimated 7,000 independent Muslims have been sentenced to up to twenty years in prison for their religious beliefs, affiliations, and practices.  The husband of defendant Nasiba Uzakova had been sentenced to fifteen years in prison in 2000, also on charges of Hizb ut-Tahrir membership. At trial, the judge announced that yet another group of women would soon be brought up on religious charges, including one of Uzakova's relatives, Musharraf Usmonova. At the time, Usmonova had been in custody for a week, while police withheld information about her whereabouts.  On the night of April 14, 2002, a group of policemen and close to forty unidentified men in civilian dress had burst into the Usmonov household, searched the premises and, though they found no illicit materials, took Musharraf Usmonova to an undisclosed location. For seven days police refused to inform her relatives of her whereabouts or even confirm that she had been detained. Usmonova's """"disappearance"""" ended on April 22-the day that the judge in the Uzakova case announced Usmonova's upcoming trial-when her lawyer finally learned of her whereabouts.  The authorities continue to deny Usmonova access to her lawyer, and her conditions in custody are not known.  """"It's hard to imagine a more dangerous situation for Usmonova,"""" said Andersen. """"There's a real threat of torture during pretrial custody in Uzbekistan, particularly when the detainee is held incommunicado.""""  Five of Musharraf Usmonova's children (ranging in age from four to sixteen) were detained until evening following their participation in the protest on April 23.  Usmonova's family has been devastated by the official crackdown on independent Islam. In June 1999, police detained and tortured to death Usmonova's husband, Farkhod, the son of a well-known imam. Also in June 1999, Usmonova's then seventeen-year-old son was arrested and sentenced to six years in prison for """"anti-state activities;"""" he was later released.

""""What happened in Gujarat was not a spontaneous uprising, it was a carefully orchestrated attack against Muslims,"""" said Smita Narula, senior South Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"The attacks were planned in advance and organized with extensive participation of the police and state government officials.""""  The police were directly implicated in nearly all the attacks against Muslims that are documented in the 75-page report, 'We Have No Orders to Save You': State Participation and Complicity in Communal Violence in Gujarat. In some cases they were merely passive observers. But in many instances, police officials led the charge of murderous mobs, aiming and firing at Muslims who got in the way.  Under the guise of offering assistance, some police officers led the victims directly into the hands of their killers. Panicked phone calls made to the police, fire brigades, and even ambulance services generally proved futile. Several witnesses reported being told by police: """"We have no orders to save you.""""  Three weeks after the initial attacks, Human Rights Watch visited Ahmedabad, a site of large-scale destruction, murder, and several massacres, and spoke to both Hindu and Muslim survivors of the attacks. The report also provides testimony on retaliatory attacks against Hindus, which Human Rights Watch strongly condemned.  More than 850 people have been killed in the Western state of Gujarat in the past two months, most of them Muslims. Unofficial estimates have put the death toll as high as 2,000. The violence began on February 27 after a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra attacked and set fire to two carriages of a train carrying Hindu activists. Fifty-eight people were killed.  Starting February 28, 2002, a three-day retaliatory killing spree by Hindus left hundreds dead and tens of thousands homeless and dispossessed. The looting and burning of Muslim homes, businesses, and places of worship was also widespread. Muslim girls and women were brutally raped. Mass graves have been dug throughout the state. Gravediggers told Human Rights Watch that bodies keep arriving, burnt and mutilated beyond recognition.  Burnt Muslim shops and restaurants dot the main roads and highways in Ahmedabad. Neighboring Hindu establishments remain notably unscathed.  Between February 28 and March 2, thousands of attackers descended on Muslim neighborhoods, clad in saffron scarves and khaki shorts, the signature uniform of Hindu nationalist groups, and armed with swords, sophisticated explosives, and gas cylinders. They were guided by voter lists and printouts of addresses of Muslim-owned properties-information obtained from the local municipality. In the weeks following the attacks, Hindu homes and businesses were also destroyed in retaliatory attacks by Muslims.  The groups most directly involved in the violence against Muslims include the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council, VHP), the Bajrang Dal, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) that heads the Gujarat state government. Collectively, they are known as the sangh parivar, or family of Hindu nationalist organizations.  The Gujarat state administration has been engaged in a massive cover-up of the state's role in the massacres and that of the sangh parivar. Numerous police reports filed by eyewitnesses after the attacks have specifically named local VHP, BJP, and Bajrang Dal leaders as instigators or participants in the violence. The police, reportedly under instructions from the state, face continuous pressure not to arrest them or to reduce the severity of the charges filed. Top police officials who sought to protect Muslims have been removed from positions of command.  """"This is a crisis of impunity,"""" said Narula. """"If charges against members of these groups are not investigated and prosecuted accordingly, violence may continue to engulf the state, and may even spread to other parts of the country.""""  The violence in Gujarat has triggered national outrage and has been strongly condemned by political parties, the National Human Rights Commission, the Indian prime minister, and civil society at large. Both the Godhra massacre and the attacks that ensued have been documented in meticulous detail by Indian human rights and civil liberties groups and by the Indian press.  """"After two months of violence, the international community is now waking up and needs to respond,"""" said Narula.  Government figures indicate that more than 98,000 people, an overwhelming majority of them Muslim, are residing in more than one hundred relief camps throughout the state. The state government has failed to provide adequate and timely humanitarian assistance to internally displaced persons in Gujarat. Relief camps visited by Human Rights Watch were in desperate need of more government and international assistance. One camp with 6,000 residents was located on the site of a Muslim graveyard. Residents were literally sleeping in the open, between the graves.  Assistance from international humanitarian and United Nations agencies is urgently needed for Hindus and Muslims in relief camps, Human Rights Watch said. It urged the Indian government to actively seek the assistance of international agencies and to invite United Nations human rights experts to investigate state and police participation in the violence in Gujarat.  Human Rights Watch also urged the international community to put pressure on the Indian government to comply with international human rights and Indian constitutional law and end impunity for orchestrated violence against Indian minorities.","Asia, India","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape, Religious Freedom"

Prolonged solitary confinement, confessions, and secret trials are regular features of the Saudi justice system.  Last week, news emerged that seven Westerners-five Britons, one Canadian, and one Belgian-were tried in secret and sentenced for a series of bombings in Saudi Arabia without the knowledge of their families, lawyers, and governments. The sentences ranged from eight years to the death penalty. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office told Human Rights Watch on April 26, and again on April 29, that it could not confirm or deny the reports, emphasizing that there was """"an ongoing judicial process"""" without providing further details. The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs told Human Rights Watch on April 26 that it was seeking official confirmation from Saudi authorities that William Sampson, the Canadian defendant, was sentenced to death in a secret trial. On April 29, the department still had not received confirmation.  """"Something is terribly wrong with the administration of justice in Saudi Arabia,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"In a fair and transparent judicial system, it should not be a mystery whether trials have taken place or if defendants have been sentenced.""""  Human Rights Watch has learned that one of the seven defendants, James Cottle, a fifty-one-year-old British citizen, was secretly tried in February 2002 and sentenced to eighteen years in prison, according to information that the British government provided to his family on April 26. Cottle was arrested in June 2001, held in solitary confinement until last month, and has not been permitted to communicate with his family. His videotaped """"confession"""" was aired on Saudi television in August 2001 (see below).  Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bill Graham told reporters on April 26 that he could not comment on the reported death sentence for Canadian defendant William Sampson. He said that he had requested information from the Saudi ambassador to Canada but """"as to [sic] this date he has not been able to give me any official confirmation of any single thing in respect of this case."""" Sampson was shown """"confessing"""" to his involvement in the bombings on Saudi television in February 2001 (see below).  The Guardian (London) reported on April 29 that the jailed Britons were only informed of the judgments when their Saudi lawyers visited them on April 28. Citing sources in Riyadh, the paper said that the defendants """"were not represented by lawyers at the hearing, which took place last October [2001],"""" and that the men """"were not aware that they were appearing in court.""""  The seven men were arrested on suspicion of carrying out a series of car bombings and other explosions in Saudi cities that began in November 2000. To date, mysterious bombings have killed one Briton and one American, and maimed and injured other Westerners. The Saudi government has insisted that the violence is the result of a turf battle among expatriates involved in the lucrative but illicit alcohol trade, not the work of Saudi militants against Westerners.  To date the Saudi government has provided no evidence publicly that implicates the seven defendants in the bombings beyond the televised """"confessions."""" On March 14, 2002, Reuters quoted a statement by Salah Hejailan, whose prominent Saudi law firm is representing the British defendants, and the other defense lawyer, Ahmed al-Tuwaijeri, saying: """"The defendants have retracted their confessions. The defense team can comfortably assert that the case will proceed consistent with those retractions. There does not appear to be any evidence other than the retracted confessions themselves.""""  Since their arrest the defendants have been held for lengthy periods in solitary confinement and denied access to family and friends. The British defendant James Cottle was held in solitary confinement until last month, according to information the British government provided to his former wife Mary Martini, who lives in Manchester, England, with their three children. Cottle has not been permitted to communicate with his family.  """"We have been sending letters every week, but we have never received a reply,"""" Martini told Human Rights Watch. She was also advised that a prison interpreter reads all the letters first, and that Cottle """"has been told of letters that he cannot have."""" Telephone calls to or from the family are not allowed.  The father of Canadian William Sampson traveled to Saudi Arabia to visit his son in March 2002, accompanied by a Canadian psychiatrist, but they were denied access, according to The Globe and Mail.  """"Denying prisoners communication with their immediate families is a harsh and unreasonable punishment,"""" said Megally. """"If these are the regulations in Saudi Arabia's prison system, then they need to be changed and brought into conformity with international standards.""""  The Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, approved by the United Nations Economic and Social Council in July 1957 and May 1977, states: """"An untried prisoner shall be allowed to inform immediately his family of his detention and shall be given all reasonable facilities for communicating with his family and friends, and for receiving visits from them, subject only to restrictions and supervision as are necessary in the interests of the administration of justice and of the security and good order of the institution.""""  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission for a three-year term from 2001 to 2003. However, Saudi Arabia is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Article 14 of the ICCPR provides guarantees of due process for any person facing criminal charges, including the right to be promptly informed of the charges against him, the right not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt, and the right to a legal defense in a fair trial brought without undue delay. Article 14 also provides that trials shall be public except as strictly necessary for reasons of morals, public order, or national security; judgments shall also be made public. Human Rights Watch opposes the infliction of the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.  Background to Saudi Arabia's Judicial Process:  In Saudi Arabia, criminal cases are heard in the general sharia (Islamic law) court, before one judge or a panel of three judges. The Court of Cassation then automatically reviews all criminal sentences exceeding ten days imprisonment or over forty lashes. The last stage of judicial review is the Supreme Judicial Council (also known as the Higher Council of the Judiciary), an eleven-member body that reviews judgments handed down in cases involving major offenses.  In the wake of the recent reports that the defendants were secretly tried and sentenced, there is confusion about which stages of Saudi Arabia's judicial process have been concluded and which proceedings remain available for the defendants.  Attorney Salah Hejailan told Human Rights Watch on April 29 that a lower court and the Court of Cassation had indeed """"ratified"""" the handwritten confessions of the defendants. Because the confessions were accepted as evidence by the courts, there were no """"trial"""" proceeding as such, and the sentences made public in the press were those initially recommended by the public prosecutor, Hejailan added. He noted that the defendants have since retracted their confessions.  Lawyer Ahmed Tuwaijeri told Human Rights Watch on April 29 that in the Saudi judicial system a sentence is not considered a judgment until it is approved-by the Royal Court in cases of capital punishment, and by the Supreme Judicial Council in other major cases. He stressed that """"no final judgment has been taken by the Supreme Judicial Council or the Royal Court"""" against the defendants.  Tuwaijeri also stated, however, that he and Hejailan """"have not been part of any court [proceeding] regarding these cases."""" But he said that the lawyers now have access to their clients in prison every Sunday and Tuesday, and """"are still in the process of interviewing them."""" He noted, """"we are having a lot of cooperation from public prosecutors and the Supreme Judicial Council."""" He said that the lawyers would be providing their first defense memorandum to the Supreme Judicial Council """"in a few weeks.""""  Hejailan previously issued a statement to the press indicating that he and Tuwaijeri """"met extensively"""" on April 22 with the head of the Supreme Judicial Council, Sheikh Saleh al-Luhaidan, and """"we have agreed with the Supreme Judicial Council to submit our written and verbal advocacy in the very near future, and we will be given all reasonable opportunities to review and defend our clients' position."""" Citing the meeting on April 22, Hejailan was quoted in the Guardian on April 28 as saying: """"I have been told very, very clearly that we will be given the opportunity to present our defense.""""  The British government emphasized to Human Rights Watch on April 26 that there was """"an ongoing judicial process"""" for the defendants, without confirming or denying that secret proceedings had taken place at lower levels. The recent comments of the lawyers suggest that the next step in the process is Supreme Judicial Council review, which will include presentations by the defense.  Televised Confessions:  The """"confessions"""" of six of the suspects were shown on Saudi television last year. On February 4, 2001, Alexander Mitchell of Britain, William Sampson of Canada, and Raaf Schyvens of Belgium were shown on a videotape claiming responsibility for two car bombings in Riyadh in November 2000 that killed British citizen Christopher Rodway, and injured his wife and others.  On August 13, 2001, three British citizens-James Cottle, James Lee, and Les Walker similarly """"confessed"""" to involvement in three bombings between December 2000 and March 2001. They stated that they had """"received orders"""" to carry out attacks in Riyadh on January 10 and March 15, 2001, and in Khobar in the Eastern Province on December 15, 2000. As with the earlier """"confessions,"""" they did not say who had ordered the bombings and gave no indication of motive.  In addition to not being allowed to write or to talk to his family, since his arrest James Cottle has also been unable to speak freely and privately to British consular officials, and have substantive private conversations with them, raising deep concern about his treatment in detention and the circumstances under which he made the videotaped """"confession."""" Cottle has received periodic visits from British consular officials since June 2001, but the conversations are closely monitored by English-speaking Saudi guards. At least one visit was abruptly terminated when Cottle started to speak on a subject not to the liking of authorities. The Canadian government confirmed that the consular visits of Cottle's codefendant William Sampson took place under similar restrictions. A spokeswoman for the DFA said that Canadian officials visited Sampson on March 30, 2002 but that """"[i]t was not possible to discuss anything substantive.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Saudi Arabia",""

Bush and Congressional leaders should press for concrete steps to improve human rights when they meet with Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao this week, Human Rights Watch said today, pointing out the lack of any progress on human rights since Bush's visit to China in February. Hu Jintao, the likely successor to President Jiang Zemin, will pay his first visit to Washington on Wednesday, May 1. The Administration must step up the pressure. There's been no improvement in human rights in China this year, and conditions worsened in some ways last year,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director for the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Hu needs to understand that China's international human rights obligations are a key issue in U.S.-China relations.""""  The U.S. has urged China to release political and religious dissidents, but there have been no prisoner releases since Bush's trip, nor has China taken any steps towards ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, or to ease harsh repression in Tibet and Xinjiang. Beijing continues to try to justify its crackdown on ethnic Uighurs in Xinjiang on anti-terrorism grounds.  Massive labor unrest in northeast China in early April led to the detention of several worker representatives. Laborers throughout China are likely to continue to take to the streets to express their grievances. The Chinese leadership has ignored offers of assistance from the International Labor Organization to help institute reforms allowing greater freedom of association among workers.  Human Rights Watch urged President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney in their meetings with Vice President Hu to also make clear U.S. concerns about serious human rights abuses in Tibet. Vice President Hu has long been associated with China's policies in Tibet. In late 1988, he was appointed Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional Communist Party Central Committee following a series of massive protests in support of Tibetan independence the previous two years. He moved quickly to repress another massive protest in March 1989, declaring martial law and ordering wide scale arrests. He later helped develop Beijing's ongoing policy towards Tibet that combines the promotion of economic development with political repression. The U.S. ambassador to China, Clark Randt, Jr., visited Tibet from April 5-10.  Both Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle and House Speaker Dennis Hastert are scheduled to host meetings with Vice President Hu on Capitol Hill. Human Rights Watch urged them to obtain Hu's agreement for a visit to China this year by the new Congressional-Executive Commission on China, a special body set up to monitor progress on human rights and the rule of law. Congress set up the Commission when it voted for Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China in October 2000.  """"Some might be tempted to play down human rights with Hu, since it's his first visit here. But that would be a major mistake,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.

Police guards remain near his hospital bed, and the police director has announced that Mr. Gongloe remains in police custody without charge pending an investigation. """"The government of Charles Taylor is using violence to silence independent voices speaking out about Liberia’s deteriorating human rights record,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “President Taylor is tightening his repressive grip, and Liberians who call on the government to respect human rights are getting in his way.”  Although no charges have been brought, Mr. Gongloe appears to have been arrested in connection with a speech he gave at a March 2002 conference in neighboring Guinea on peace in the Mano River Union. The speech dealt with ways in which civil society groups could play a role in the attainment of peace in the Mano River Union, and condemned the use of violence as a means to state power. The same day as Mr. Gongloe’s arrest, the government ordered the closure of The Analyst newspaper, which had just printed the speech made by Mr. Gongloe.  Mr. Gongloe is well known for his representation of clients in human rights cases, and for speaking out against security force abuses. On April 24, Mr. Gongloe was stopped in his car by police officer Dolo Mark, arrested, and taken to the police headquarters around 5:00 pm. At the police station, he was interrogated about the statement he had made at the conference in Guinea.  After briefly being questioned, he was stripped nude and placed in the police cells in the basement. Two plainclothes police officers in the cell proceeded to severely beat and kick him through the night. They also threatened him, telling him he was a dissident whom they would deal with, and that they would kill him. In the morning, he was taken again for questioning, but was unable to stand or sit as a result of his injuries. Lawyers who had been notified of Mr. Gongloe’s whereabouts pressured the police to hospitalize Mr. Gongloe. Mr. Gongloe is currently at Cooper Hospital where he is receiving treatment. As a result of the torture, Mr. Gongloe has lost some hearing in his left ear, his left eye is swollen and bloodied, and his head and body are badly bruised.  Two police officers remain on guard outside his hospital room. On April 25, the Police Director Paul Mulbah reportedly made a statement on radio saying that Mr. Gongloe remained in police custody while police investigations continued.  “Clearly, Mr. Gongloe remains at great risk of further police brutality and harassment,” said Takirambudde. “President Charles Taylor must immediately end this harassment and intimidation of rights activists.”  This incident is the most recent in a spate of arrests carried out by the government since it imposed a state of emergency on February 8, 2002. In the face of renewed rebel action and negative international publicity, the government of President Charles Taylor has become increasingly intolerant of criticism. In particular, the government has intensified its harassment and intimidation of the independent press, civil society groups, and legitimate political opposition groups.","Africa, Liberia","Torture, Free Speech"

""""Now the government must take action to ensure the human rights violations described by the commission do not go unpunished.""""  The report, released on April 18, documented 110 cases of political murder and forced disappearance carried out by the Panamanian security forces between 1968 and 1989, a period of military rule in Panama. It also detailed the brutal forms of torture that the military employed against political dissidents during those years.  Under international law, the government of Panama is obligated to investigate and prosecute human rights abuses, including those committed under prior regimes. A government that fails to investigate and punish abuses is, in effect, tolerating their practice.  In its letter, Human Rights Watch proposed that President Moscoso name a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute the crimes documented by the commission. The organization noted that similar prosecutors have been named in other Latin American countries, including Mexico and Peru.

We wholeheartedly welcome these developments and appreciate your government's role in bringing them about.    At the same time, we would like to emphasize the importance of your sustaining and expanding this cooperation with the tribunal. Such full cooperation should include unfettered access for tribunal prosecutors to relevant documents and other evidence, the swift transfer of all those who have surrendered to the Hague, apprehension of all remaining indictees at large on Yugoslav territory, and your public support for the tribunal's processes.   As you know, Human Rights Watch is a privately funded international non-governmental organization dedicated to documenting human rights abuses throughout the world. In the past ten years, we have committed substantial time and effort to investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. We have documented violations of international humanitarian law by all sides to the conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the NATO war with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   We have long advocated accountability for those responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during those wars. Individual accountability for these crimes is an essential element of the transition away from the politics of interethnic suspicion and conflict that have plagued the region. It is the best way to establish a clear historical record of what happened, substitute individual responsibility for collective guilt, disassociate ethnic groups as a whole from atrocities committed in their name, and pave the way toward a sustainable Balkan peace and reintegration of the region into Europe.   In light of the severity of the abuses and the long-standing inability or unwillingness of any of the governments in the region to hold those responsible accountable, it has been our view that trials in the Hague were the best chance the people of the region had to obtain an impartial adjudication of the alleged crimes. This is not to say that we are uncritically supportive of the tribunal. But having monitored its proceedings closely, we can assure you that it meets the highest standards of criminal procedure. As evidenced by numerous decisions favorable to Serb suspects and victims, allegations of its bias against Serbs are utterly unfounded. As a close and impartial observer can attest, the proceedings have offered every guarantee necessary for a fair criminal trial: scrupulous respect for the rights of the accused, opportunities for witnesses to be heard and challenged, and the careful weighing of evidence to determine responsibility for alleged crimes. Thus, we are pleased at the recent signs of your government's willingness to follow through on its commitment to cooperate with the tribunal. We hope that the pending transfers of indictees from Yugoslavia to the Hague reflect an irreversible shift in your government's posture toward the process of justice and accountability for war crimes in the Balkan wars. It would be a shame were these positive steps to be followed by a renewed complacency, as was the case following the arrest and transfer of Slobodan Milosevic last year. In failing to sustain the level of cooperation signaled by the Milosevic transfer last year, your government lost a significant opportunity to distance itself unequivocally from the Milosevic legacy and to build a new future in Europe.   To do that now, we urge you and the newly formed Cooperation Committee to pursue each of the following essential elements of full cooperation with the ICTY:  Take immediate steps to provide the ICTY with full and unfettered access to requested relevant documents in the possession of government ministries, including the Yugoslav Army, the Yugoslav Ministry of Interior, State Security, the Yugoslav Presidency, the Yugoslav cabinet, the Yugoslav Defence Ministry, the Serbian Presidency, and the Serbian cabinet. As a first step, the foregoing ministries should make an index of records and archives available to tribunal prosecutors and facilitate tribunal consultation with archivists so that the prosecutor can determine which documents are relevant to its on-going trials and investigations. Your government's obstruction of tribunal efforts to obtain relevant documents has become an extremely serious obstacle to the tribunal's work. Indeed, in the Milosevic trial, it has had the indirect effect of giving an apparent advantage to Milosevic, who seems to enjoy better access to certain government documents than do the prosecutors.  Take immediate steps to facilitate ICTY access to potential witnesses.  Ensure that those who have committed to go voluntarily to the Hague to stand trial do so as soon as possible.  Take immediate steps to apprehend and transfer to the Hague all remaining indictees at large in Yugoslav territory. We have expressed concern that indictees might exploit certain vague language in the recently adopted law on cooperation, and we hope that your government will not allow any such efforts to obstruct your fulfillment of your commitment to cooperate with the ICTY.  Make a public, principled commitment to cooperate with the tribunal and its processes. Too often, cooperation with the ICTY is presented to the Serbian people as necessary only to avoid Yugoslavia's economic isolation. Certainly this is one reason for cooperation. But a far better reason is that individual criminal responsibility is consistent with post-Milosevic Yugoslavia's commitment to uphold human rights and the rule of law on their merits and to act against their violation as a matter of principle. We urge you to exercise your leadership to make this case to the people of Yugoslavia.  Thank you for your attention to our concerns.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/04/25/drc-power-sharing-pact-fails-secure-peace-rwanda","DRC- Power Sharing Pact Fails to Secure Peace with Rwanda","DRC: Power Sharing Pact Fails to Secure Peace with Rwanda","A Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper","04/25/2002","I. BACKGROUND A partial power-sharing pact reached on April 19 at the end of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue between the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the rebel Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) and most members of the unarmed opposition and civil society groups excluded the mainstream rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) and failed to secure peace with Rwanda. This inconclusive outcome could set the scene for renewed fighting and abuses against civilians, particularly in the Kivu provinces and in northeastern Congo. Stopping the violence in these areas is a priority, not just in order to save lives, but also to keep the Lusaka peace process on track. Given the massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by all the parties to the conflict in eastern Congo, the already dire situation requires urgent attention. We strongly support the Secretary-General’s recommendation that the Security Council increase the number of MONUC troops, but the escalating violence in places like Ituri and the Haut Plateau in south Kivu cannot wait for these troops to be authorized and assembled. We therefore call on the Security Council to increase political pressure on all parties to abide by their obligations to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement as well as their obligations under international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions, particularly with respect to the protection of civilians in areas under their control. If such pressure is effectively applied, the governmental actors will more likely insist that local forces under their sway also adopt the necessary measures to end abuses against civilians. A combination of increased pressures on all parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement as well as the redeployment of some of the troops of the U.N. Organization Mission in Congo (MONUC) could help end rampant human rights violations and preempt the risks of military escalation in the broader war. RCD-Goma and Rwandan Areas Disappointment in many quarters about the outcome of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue is likely to increase the hostility of the population toward the RCD-Goma. Already, tensions are running high. Recent information received by Human Rights Watch indicates that the Banyamulenge civil society leaders have credible fears of an impending crackdown on their community by the RCD-Goma and the Rwandan army. The insurgency by a Banyamulenge commander and his followers against what they perceived as the exploitation by the RCD-Goma and Rwanda of their community’s cause to perpetuate Rwanda’s occupation of eastern Congo considerably weakened the RCD-Goma ahead of and during the Inter-Congolese Dialogue. Human Rights Watch fears that the deepening isolation of the RCD, even within what used to be its power base, would only increase the vulnerability of the Banyamulenge and the rest of the population to repression. Human Rights Watch will soon be publishing a report on the widespread but little known problem of the use of sexual violence, particularly rape, against women and girls in eastern Congo. Combatants of the RCD, Rwandan soldiers, as well as combatants of the forces opposed to them -- Mai-Mai, armed groups of Rwandan and Burundian Hutu rebels -- all frequently and sometimes systematically raped women and girls during this conflict. The RCD-Goma continues to forcibly recruit children for its army, and its officials regularly call on their home constituents to produce a certain number of recruits. There are frequent cases of arbitrary detention and torture. Insecurity is rampant in urban areas, where nocturnal attacks, often by drunken soldiers, are routine. RCD-Mouvement de Liberation (ML), RCD-National Areas The situation in northeastern Congo remains extremely precarious. The killing on April 18 in Bunia of a commander loyal to the president of the RCD-ML Mbusa Nyamwisi triggered skirmishes between two factions of the rebel army in which at least a dozen soldiers were killed. The split within the RCD-ML army occurred along ethnic and regional lines, with Hema soldiers reportedly accusing Mbusa loyalists of supporting their archrivals of the Lendu community, and obstructing the autonomous administration of the Ugandan proclaimed Ituri province. The Nande people, whose power base is in Beni in north Kivu, appear thus on the verge of being drawn into the deadly interethnic conflict of Ituri. As Human Rights Watch has reported, Uganda’s pursuit of its strategic and economic interests in Congo has had deadly consequences for the population in areas under its occupation. Nowhere is this more obvious than in Ituri, the scene since mid1999 of communal fighting between Hema and Lendu fueled by Ugandan meddling, in which an estimated twenty thousands people were killed, and another 200,000 people were displaced. In the latest round of violence starting in mid-January, hundreds were killed and thousands were forced to flee their homes. This surge was largely fueled by the leadership rivalries within the RCD-ML that exploded into the open last Thursday. It was also fed by fighting between the RCD-ML and allied MLC and RCD-National forces for the control of mineral rich areas in Oriental province. Ituri is indeed rich in timber, coffee, gold, diamonds, and coltan, in addition to lucrative daily cash flows from customs posts on the border with Uganda. Much of the proceeds from these resources are funneled by local power brokers to their supporters within the Ugandan establishment as documented in two reports by the U.N. Panel of Experts on resource exploitation in Congo. None of the proceeds is reinvested in the amelioration of the daily lot of the ordinary Congolese who continue to die from malnutrition, and preventable and curable diseases. In the meantime, Kampala continues to expertly maintain its alliance with all the competing local actors through the provision of political, diplomatic, and military backing, even when these allies were locked in deadly feuds. Government Areas President Joseph Kabila promises of sweeping democratic, legal, and human rights reforms remain to be fully met. The government has imposed and abided by a moratorium on the execution of death sentences since last March, although death sentences continue to be handed down. The government’s campaign to demobilize child soldiers is gaining ground. But a plethora of competing security agencies continue the numerous abuses for which they were notorious in the past. Horrendous conditions continue to prevail in detention centers and prisons. Kabila's promises to limit the powers of the abusive Court of Military Order (COM) has brought no reform to date. 135 people accused of involvement in the assassination of former President Kabila are currently facing trial before the COM and are likely to face the death penalty if found guilty. Many in the group were said to have been tortured and to have had no legal counsel before the trial. There is no right of appeal. Human rights defenders who document and publicize abuses by the COM are themselves targeted. Prominent activist N’sii Luanda Shandwe is being held without charge in Kinshasa, following his arrest by agents of the COM on 19 April. II. RECOMMENDATIONS Human Rights Watch calls on the Security Council to:  Increase political pressure on all parties to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement to abide by their obligations to the Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement as well as their obligations under international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions, particularly with respect to the protection of civilians in areas under their control. If such pressure is effectively applied, the governmental actors will more likely insist that local forces under their sway also adopt the necessary measures to end abuses against civilians. Hold the occupying powers in eastern Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi, accountable for the conduct of their troops on the ground. Direct MONUC military and civilian observers to be more proactive in mitigating local conflicts. In particular, MONUC observers should investigate all credible reports of attacks on civilians by all parties by visiting sites of the alleged attacks and interviewing survivors and relatives of victims. This could be done under the terms of the Mission’s current mandate by redeploying observers to flashpoints, such as Shabunda, Minembwe and in the beleaguered Ituri province and not only its headquarters of Bunia. The Security Council should require state parties to the Lusaka Agreement to guarantee the security of the Mission’s personnel, and facilitate their movement and access. Ensure that civilian components of MONUC, particularly child protection and humanitarian affairs advisers and human rights observers, are tasked directly with monitoring and reporting on sexual violence. Address the question of impunity for atrocities in the DRC, and in particular, establish a U.N. Commission of Experts to investigate and determine responsibility for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the DRC, including sexual violence. The Commission of Experts should recommend to the Security Council an appropriate mechanism to bring to justice persons responsible for violations. Direct the staff of U.N. agencies working in eastern Congo to give priority to programs focused on the rights of women and girls, the elimination of sexual violence, and the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","Crisis and Conflict"

In letters sent to Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Human Rights Watch welcomed their efforts to facilitate the surrender or arrest of people who have been indicted by the tribunal, and urged them to continue. Today Former Yugoslav Army chief of staff Dragoljub Ojdanic, charged along with Slobodan Milosevic for crimes committed during the Kosovo war, traveled to The Hague to surrender voluntarily for trial. Human Rights Watch documented Ojdanic's role in the Kosovo conflict in its 2001 report, """"Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo."""" Five other indictees have promised to surrender within the next two weeks, while Serbian authorities have issued arrest warrants for an additional seventeen men wanted by the Hague tribunal. While welcoming these developments, Human Rights Watch cautioned that they could be undermined if the Yugoslav and Serb governments keep officials of the Hague tribunal from getting access to documents and evidence they need to pursue ongoing investigations and trials. """"Belgrade has made real progress on cooperating with the tribunal, and we welcome that,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But in the area of access to documents and witnesses, there's been essentially no cooperation at all."""" Andersen noted that Slobodan Milosevic, currently on trial at the Hague tribunal, appears to have extensive access to government documents in preparing his defense. """"Sometimes Milosevic seems to have better access to official documents than the prosecutors do,"""" said Andersen. Human Rights Watch also urged Kostunica and Djindjic to maintain the momentum on cooperation until all indictees present in the country are in custody in The Hague. Andersen cautioned against repeating the pattern set last year, when the arrest and transfer of Milosevic was followed by a lull in Yugoslav cooperation with the tribunal. """"They lost a real opportunity last year,"""" Andersen said. """"Hopefully there is now a recognition that international accountability for war crimes is an essential element of their efforts to put the Milosevic era behind them and move forward toward stabilization of the region and its reintegration in Europe.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/04/24/ecuador-widespread-labor-abuse-banana-plantations","Ecuador- Widespread Labor Abuse on Banana Plantations","Ecuador: Widespread Labor Abuse on Banana Plantations","Harmful Child Labor, Anti-Union Bias Plague Industry","04/24/2002","Banana workers in Ecuador are the victims of serious human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today.  In its investigation, Human Rights Watch found that Ecuadorian children as young as eight work on banana plantations in hazardous conditions, while adult workers fear firing if they try to exercise their right to organize. Ecuador is the world’s largest banana exporter and the source of roughly one quarter of all bananas on the tables of U.S. and European consumers. Banana-exporting corporations such as Ecuadorian-owned Noboa and Favorita, as well as Chiquita, Del Monte, and Dole fail to use their financial influence to insist that their supplier plantations respect workers’ rights, the report found. Dole leads the pack of foreign multinationals in sourcing from Ecuador, obtaining nearly one third of all its bananas from the country.  “The Ecuadorian bananas on your table may have been produced under appalling conditions,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “Banana companies have a duty to uphold workers’ rights. Ecuador is obligated under international law to do so.”  The use of harmful child labor is widespread in Ecuador’s banana sector. Researchers for the Human Rights Watch report, Tainted Harvest: Child Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Ecuador’s Banana Plantations, spoke with forty-five child laborers during their three-week long fact-finding mission in Ecuador. Forty-one of the children began working between the ages of eight and thirteen, most starting at ages ten or eleven. Their average workday lasted twelve hours, and fewer than 40 percent of the children were still in school by the time they turned fourteen.  In the course of their work, they were exposed to toxic pesticides, used sharp knives and machetes, hauled heavy loads of bananas, drank unsanitary water, and some were sexually harassed. Roughly 90 percent of the children told Human Rights Watch that they continued working while toxic fungicides were sprayed from airplanes flying overhead. For their efforts, the children earned an average of $3.50 per day, approximately 60 percent of the legal minimum wage for banana workers.  Chiquita, Del Monte, Dole, Favorita, and Noboa have all, at some time, been supplied by plantations on which children labored, with more than 70 percent of the children interviewed saying they had worked on plantations that almost exclusively supply Dole. When Human Rights Watch asked Dole to confirm or deny its business relationship with these suppliers, it refused, claiming this is “business proprietary information.” Dole’s web site states, “Dole does not knowingly purchase products from any commercial producers employing minors.”  “Banana-exporting companies may tell you they’re not responsible for labor abuses,” Vivanco said. “But they have financial power and could use it to ensure respect for workers’ rights. They just don’t.”  Adult workers face an environment in which they are often too scared to exercise their right to organize for better working conditions. Only approximately 1 percent of banana workers are affiliated with workers’ organizations—a rate far lower than any Central American banana-exporting country.  Ecuadorian law fails to protect effectively the right to freedom of association, and employers take advantage of the weak law and even weaker enforcement to impede worker organizing.  Workers illegally fired for union activity have no right to reinstatement. Instead, in the unlikely event that the offending employers are found responsible, they must pay only a negligible fine—often less than $400. And employers circumvent labor laws by relying on subcontractors to provide workers and by hiring “permanent temporary” workers with even fewer rights than permanent workers. The heavy use of subcontracted “perma-temps” has created a workforce with no right to bargain with employers who control working conditions. Instead, subcontracted “perma-temps” only enjoy the relatively useless right to organize and bargain with their virtually powerless subcontractors.  “Most workers on these plantations can’t organize to protest their working conditions,” Vivanco said. “Either they suffer in silence, or they risk being fired.”  Human Rights Watch urged banana-exporting corporations to demand that labor rights be respected on their supplier plantations and to monitor compliance with this requirement.  Human Rights Watch also called on Ecuador to enforce its labor laws. The organization also urged Ecuador to guarantee children’s right to education by ensuring, as required by the country’s own law, that all children under fifteen have access to free schooling. In addition, Human Rights Watch called for the amendment of labor legislation to guarantee workers’ right to freedom of association by banning anti-union discrimination in hiring, requiring reinstatement of workers fired for union activity, strengthening laws governing the use of temporary workers, and adopting meaningful sanctions for anti-union conduct Vivanco said the report’s findings highlight the need for effective labor rights protections in any future trade agreement with Ecuador, including the Free Trade Area of the Americas.  Testimonies taken from Tainted Harvest: Child Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Ecuador’s Banana Plantations  Below are testimonies from workers interviewed by Human Rights Watch for the report, Tainted Harvest: Child Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Banana Plantations in Ecuador. The workers’ names have been changed to protect them from potential employer reprisals.  Child Labor  Exposure to Toxic Substances Fabiola Cardozo told Human Rights Watch that twice when she was twelve she became ill after aerial fumigation. She described that the first time, “I got a fever. . . . I told my boss that I felt sick. . . . He told me to go home. . . . [The second time,] I became covered with red things. They itched. I had a cough. My bones hurt. I told my boss. He sent me home.” Similarly, Carolina Chamorro told Human Rights Watch that after aerial fumigation, “I felt sick twice. I was ten years old. . . . I began to shake.” She said that she thought she was going to faint and told her boss, who sent her home. Cristَbal Alvarez, a twelve-year-old boy, also explained, “That poison - sometimes it makes one sick. Of course, I keep working. I don’t cover myself. Once I got sick. I vomited [and] had a headache . . . after the fumigation. I was eleven years old. . . . I told my bosses. They gave me two days to recover.”  The children told Human Rights Watch about the various methods that they used to protect themselves from the toxic liquid: hiding under banana leaves, bowing their heads, covering their faces with their shirts, covering their noses and mouths with their hands, and placing banana cartons on their heads. As one fourteen-year-old boy, Enrique Gallana, explained, “When the planes pass, we cover ourselves with our shirts. . . . We just continue working. . . . We can smell the pesticides.”  Sexual Harassment Human Rights Watch interviewed three young girls, ages twelve, twelve, and eleven, who described being sexually harassed by the then “boss” of the packing plants on San Fernando and San Alejandro, plantations of the Las Fincas group. Human Rights Watch observed a roadside sign bearing the Dole logo above the name “Las Fincas,” strongly suggesting that the plantation group primarily supplies Dole. Marta Mendoza, a twelve-year-old who began working on Las Fincas at age eleven, explained to Human Rights Watch, “There is a boss at the plant who’s very sick. . . . This man is rude. He goes around touching girls’ bottoms. . . . He is in charge there and is always there. He told me that he wants to make love to me. Once he touched me. I was taking off plastic banana coverings, and he touched my bottom. He keeps bothering me. He goes around throwing kisses at me. He calls me ‘my love.’” Fabiola Cardozo, a twelve-year-old who began working on Las Fincas at age ten, similarly commented, “The boss of the packing plants . . . says, ‘Oh, my love.’ When we bend down to pick up plastic bags, he says, ‘Allي para meterle huevito.’ [‘There is a good place to stick my balls.’]”  Freedom of Association  After working as a “perma-temp” for a year and a half on the same two banana plantations, Gema Caranza was indefinitely “suspended” on May 7, 2001, allegedly for involvement in union activity. She explained that she was told by the boss of the packing plants that “[the administrator] has found out what you’re involved in and [is afraid] that you will want to speak with the people and organize.” According to Caranza, her boss, with whom she had a good working relationship, added, “I told you not to get involved in that, that you’d lose your job.”  Caranza said that in June 2000, she began to attend union-sponsored events and seminars. In most cases, she said, she invented excuses for her absence, afraid to disclose their true purpose. Before leaving for her first union-sponsored event outside Ecuador, however, she showed her boss the event invitation. She said, “He told me to be careful [and] that others might soon know [what I was doing].” Caranza said, “I knew that if they [the administrator, the plantation owner, or others in management] found out, they would fire me. . . . Because that’s the way it is. If they find out, they fire you. This is why most people are scared.”","Americas, Ecuador","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

According to information received by Human Rights Watch, six human rights advocates and two independent journalists were beaten and arrested on March 4, 2002, at a provincial hospital in Ciego de Avila, Cuba, where they had staged a peaceful protest. They had gone to the hospital in support of a reporter who had been physically attacked by the police earlier in the day while he was traveling to a meeting of the Cuban Foundation for Human Rights.  """"The beating and incarceration of these activists is unjustifiable,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is yet another example of the Cuban government's intolerance of political dissidence and independent journalism.""""  Human Rights Watch has been informed that the human rights defenders prayed for the hospitalized reporter and briefly shouted statements such as """"Long live human rights."""" The group stopped yelling and sat down in a hospital hallway when hospital workers requested they be quiet. After they had been sitting quietly for approximately one hour, the state security police arrived. The police dragged the activists and journalists from the hospital, beating them and placing them in detention.  Juan Carlos González Leiva, one of the incarcerated activists, is a blind man who is president of the Cuban Foundation for Human Rights and the Fraternity for the Blind in Cuba. Due to the physical assault by police at the time of his arrest, he required four stitches on his forehead. He has been accused of public disorder and contempt, crimes that carry a possible prison sentence of one to three years. No trial date has yet been set in his case.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern that González is not receiving appropriate treatment in prison. Human Rights Watch has been informed that the authorities have taken away his glasses and his cane, and no special accommodations have been made for his blindness.  The others, who remain incarcerated in various detention centers in Cuba, include five human rights defenders, Delio Laureano Requejo, Lázaro Iglesias Estrada, Virgilio Mantilla Arango, Enrique García Morejón, and Antonio García Morejón, and two independent journalists, Léxter Téllez Castro and Carlos Brizuela Yera.","Americas, Cuba",""

The 200-page report, Repression of Montagnards: Conflicts over Land and Religion in Vietnam's Central Highlands, provides the most detailed account to date of the unrest that erupted in the Central Highlands of Vietnam in early 2001 and offers a rare glimpse into the mechanisms of Vietnamese political repression.  """"The Montagnards have been repressed by Vietnam for decades. This has got to stop,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Vietnam should open up the Central Highlands to human rights monitors, journalists, and diplomats, and begin to seriously address the underlying grievances fuelling the unrest.""""  In February 2001, several thousand members of indigenous minorities, commonly known as Montagnards, held a series of demonstrations calling for independence, return of ancestral land, and religious freedom.  Human Rights Watch provides an in-depth analysis of the grievances that gave rise to the protests, and an analysis of the human rights violations that took place in response to them. It found that the Vietnamese government violated fundamental human rights in the course of suppressing the protests, and that those violations-which range from government infringement of religious freedom to torture by police-were continuing as of March 2002.  Vietnamese authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive show of force, deploying thousands of police and soldiers to disperse the protesters. In the weeks and months following the demonstrations, authorities arrested hundreds of highlanders, sometimes using torture to elicit confessions and public statements of remorse by protest organizers. They also targeted religious gatherings and arrested religious leaders, equating the evangelical Protestantism followed by many of the highlanders with anti-government organizing. Some of those arrested in connection with the protests were tried and given heavy prison sentences. More than 1,000 highlanders fled to Cambodia, where they were sheltered in two refugee camps operated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  Since the February 2001 protests, news from the troubled region has been difficult to obtain. The Vietnamese government has banned western news media, foreign diplomats, and U.N. officials from traveling to the area, other than on strictly controlled government tours.  In March 2002, Cambodia authorized the processing for resettlement in the United States of more than 900 Montagnard asylum seekers who fled to Cambodia over the last year. Cambodia has now closed down its refugee camps, sealed its borders with Vietnam, and announced that any new arrivals will be immediately deported.  """"Cambodia is violating its international obligations to provide temporary asylum,"""" Jendrzejczyk said. """"But the turmoil in the highlands-and the refugee flow to Cambodia-is likely to continue until Hanoi takes effective action to end the mistreatment of Montagnards.""""  Loyalty Oaths, Church Burning, Police Torture  The report includes detailed case studies on repressive tactics employed by the Vietnamese government to stem free expression and the right to freedom of religion. For example, authorities have systematically conducted """"goat's blood ceremonies,"""" in dozens of villages in the highlands starting in June 2001. Villagers who had participated in the February 2001 demonstrations were forced to stand up in front of their entire village and local authorities to admit their wrongdoing, pledge to cease any contacts with outside groups, and renounce their religion. To seal their loyalty, they were forced to drink rice wine mixed with goat's blood.  """"They asked us to drink goat's blood, but we never saw any goat,"""" one traumatized young villager told Human Rights Watch. """"We wondered where the blood was from. If we didn't drink it, they would beat us. We didn't know if it was from a chicken or a dog or what. I am afraid I will have health problems in the future.""""  Human Rights Watch also described the excessive use of force by security forces in Plei Lao, Gia Lai province in March 2001, when several hundred troops surrounded and entered the village late at night to break up an all-night prayer meeting. In a confrontation with villagers, security forces fired into the crowd, killing one villager. They then burned down the village church. One villager described what happened:  """"First the police ordered some Vietnamese civilians to ransack and destroy the church with axes. They used a cable tied to a vehicle to topple it and the soldiers used their gun butts. Then they forced the ethnic Jarai to burn it,"""" he said. """"Everyone was crying-for the dead and wounded, and for the church.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the fate of more than 500 Montagnard asylum seekers who have been forcibly deported from Cambodia to Vietnam over the last twelve months. In an incident in March 2001, nineteen Jarai men were tortured and imprisoned after being deported from Cambodia, as described by one eyewitness:  """"They beat us over our whole body, including our heads,"""" he said. """"They beat our fingers, hands, arms, and necks-everywhere. There was no blood because they used a rubber truncheon. After beating us they took our photographs again.""""  Internal government documents obtained by Human Rights Watch-previously unavailable to an international audience-support much of the witness testimony. Citizen petitions from Montagnards detail long-standing land conflicts, arbitrary confiscation of ancestral lands, disruption of Protestant church services, employment discrimination against minority Christians, and the lack of government response to citizen complaints.  A twenty-two page confidential directive issued by the Vietnamese Communist Party in June 2001 specifically directs party cadres how to interpret and respond to the ethnic unrest in the Central Highlands. The directive shows that the party links the highlanders' escalating demands for land rights, religious freedom, and even independence with the growing popularity of evangelical Protestantism.  The party directive also alleges that enemies of the party have targeted the Central Highlands, taking advantage of evangelical Christianity and """"the concepts of freedom and democracy"""" in order to create """"artificial"""" demands for land and the right to freedom of religion.  Human Rights Watch provides detailed policy recommendations for the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the Royal Government of Cambodia, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Human Rights Watch also urges the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and Vietnam's donors to press Hanoi to respect the rights of indigenous minorities.","Asia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers"

We have upheld this right both when international borders were settled - Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Malawi, Burma, Mauritania - and when they were in dispute - Bosnia, Croatia, Kosovo, East Timor, Ethiopia/Eritrea.  Human Rights Watch similarly urges that this right be recognized for all displaced people in the Middle East, regardless of religion or nationality.  In the case of the Middle East peace agreement currently being negotiated, the agreement should recognize this right for Palestinian refugees and exiles from territory located in what is now Israel or in what is likely to be a future state of Palestine.  Recognition should accord with the following principles: The right is held not only by those who fled a territory initially but also by their descendants, so long as they have maintained appropriate links with the relevant territory.  The right persists even when sovereignty over the territory is contested or has changed hands.  If a former home no longer exists or is occupied by an innocent third party, return should be permitted to the vicinity of the former home.   As in the case of all displaced people, those unable to return to a former home because it is occupied or has been destroyed, or those who have lost property, are entitled to compensation.  However, compensation is not a substitute for the right to return to the vicinity of a former home should that be one's choice. All nations should assist in finding durable solutions to refugee problems.  Ideally, this consists of giving each displaced person three options: local integration, third-country resettlement, and voluntary repatriation.  In the Middle East context, countries where Palestinians now reside should offer them the option of full local integration.  Palestinian families, many having lived in these countries for more than fifty years, have built lives there which they should be granted the option of continuing to lead.  Similarly, the international community should be generous in offering the possibility of third-country resettlement to those who might desire it, and in providing aid to assist the permanent settlement of those who choose to remain in the region as well as those who choose to exercise their right to return.  Neither the options of local integration and third-country resettlement, nor their absence, should extinguish the right to return; their humanitarian purpose is to allow individual Palestinians to select during a specified period among several choices for ending their refugee status. Like all rights, the right to return binds governments.  No government can violate this right.  Only individuals may elect not to exercise it.  The parties currently involved in negotiating a Middle East peace agreement should focus on implementing the right to return and facilitating the options of local integration and third-country resettlement.  They should not waive individuals' right to return. The international community has a duty to ensure that claims of a right to return are resolved fairly, that individual holders of the right are permitted freely and in an informed manner to choose whether to exercise it, and that returns proceed in a gradual and orderly manner.

In Jordan, for example, most of the 1.5 million Palestinians have citizenship and are well integrated socially and economically, although some 278,678 are still living in camps. Unlike Jordan, Syria has maintained the stateless status of its Palestinians but has afforded them the same economic and social rights enjoyed by Syrian citizens. According to a 1956 law, Palestinians are treated as if they are Syrians """"in all matters pertaining to...the rights of employment, work, commerce, and national obligations"""".  As a consequence, Palestinians in Syria do not suffer from massive unemployment or underemployment,  and only about 111,208 refugees live in camps. At the same time Palestinians, like Syrian citizens, remain under a powerful state system in which basic civil and political rights -- such as freedom of expression and association -- are tightly controlled, and a state of emergency, in force since 1963, grants broad, unchecked powers to a vast security apparatus. In Lebanon, in sharp contrast, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians are stateless and over half live in overcrowded camps. The right to work is severely restricted, and massive poverty has become the norm. The situation of the Palestinians in Lebanon deteriorated steadily in the wake of the expulsion of PLO guerrillas following the 1982 Israeli invasion.  By some accounts, of the 375,218 Palestinians  registered as refugees with UNRWA in Lebanon, only some 200,000 remain; others have fled from the inhospitable conditions that successive Lebanese governments have sustained over the last two decades.(1)  Initially the response of host Arab states to the incoming Palestinian refugees was to offer them refuge on the assumption that it would be temporary. When it became obvious that the problem would be protracted, the policies of Arab states toward the refugees changed, and the initial sympathy was coupled with an insistence on Israel's ultimate responsibility for them. As a result most Arab governments strongly opposed resettlement and naturalization of the refugees. Instead, they adopted policies and procedures aimed at preserving the Palestinian identity of the individuals and their status as refugees.  Egypt is the only Arab host country that is a state party to the 1951 Convention Relative to the Status of Refugees. However, in September 1965 the council of foreign ministers of the League of Arab States formally acknowledged certain rights for Palestinians by signing the Protocol for the Treatment of Palestinians in Arab States,  known as the Casablanca Protocol. This brief document called upon member states to """"take the necessary measures"""" to guarantee to Palestinians full residency rights, freedom of movement within and among Arab countries, and the right to work on a par with citizens.  But the protocol's good intentions clashed with subsequent developments on the ground.  UNHCR notes that, """"as the Palestinian nationalist movement came into conflict with the governments of the Arab states, the legal status of the Palestinians diminished.  As a result, few Palestinians in the Arab world now enjoy a secure right to remain in their country of residence.""""(2)   For example, as the Palestinian liberation movement gained momentum, this created political and sovereignty tensions within some host countries. This was further exacerbated by attacks on Israel and Israeli citizens carried out by Palestinian guerrillas from the territory of those host countries which then bore the brunt of reprisals from Israel - often resulting in deaths and injuries to the local civilian population. In Jordan, Palestinian fighters clashed several times with the Jordanian army and were finally expelled in 1971. In Lebanon, they became embroiled in a civil war, and their attacks on Israel lead to an Israeli invasion in 1982 and their expulsion from Lebanon.       In addition, as Abbas Shiblak, founder of the Palestinian Diaspora and Refugee Centre (Shaml) points out, in the host countries """"Palestinian affairs are governed by ministerial decrees or administrative orders, which allow differing interpretations and abuses of power and can easily be reversed in response to changing political conditions."""" (3)  In Egypt, for example, Palestinians experienced worsening treatment after the signing of the peace treaty with Israel in 1978. According to one study, Palestinian students were, until 1978, """"treated like the Egyptians who received free education in schools, universities and institutes.""""(4)   Then the government gradually began to impose hard currency tuition fees for Palestinians, treating them as foreigners, and """"banned Palestinian students from joining colleges of medicine, pharmacy, economics, political science, and journalism.""""(5)   In addition, presidential decrees in July 1978 (No. 47 and 48) """"canceled earlier decisions which treated the Palestinians like the Egyptians.  The Ministry of Human Resources also prohibited the employment of foreigners including Palestinians in trade, particularly imports and exports, except those who were married to Egyptians for more than five years.""""(6)  More recent and extreme examples of punitive treatment of Palestinians as a byproduct of regional politics include Kuwait's expulsion of tens of thousands of long-term residents in the wake of the 1991 Gulf war (leaving the Gazans among them who carried Egyptian travel documents with nowhere to go because the Egyptian government denied them entry), and the Libyan government's move in 1995 to demonstrate its displeasure with Arafat's peace negotiations with Israel by not renewing the one-year residency visas of some 30,000 Palestinians and beginning summary deportations. Egypt again provides an illustration of the restrictions on freedom of movement of resident Palestinians. Under Law No. 28 of 1960, Palestinians were entitled to receive Egyptian travel documents, but these documents """"did not grant the bearer the right to enter Egypt unless a visa is obtained from the Egyptian consulates abroad beforehand.""""(7)  Thus, holders of such documents who were born in Egypt or who have lived there for most of their lives have no automatic right to stay in or reenter the country, but must renew their visas every six months to three years. Human Rights Watch is aware of cases of Palestinians born in Egypt who have been trapped abroad because Egyptian consulates denied their entry visa requests in summary fashion, without providing reasons. Advocates of Palestinian refugees' rights cite these and other examples to underscore the fragility of the refugees' residency in host countries, and the pressing need for a more secure legal status that offers firm guarantees of freedom of movement. Lebanon provides the clearest example of a host state's denial of rights, use of refugees as political pawns, and illegal discrimination. In Lebanon, many Palestinians are preoccupied with basic survival, overwhelmed by poor physical conditions in the refugee camps, pervasive poverty, high unemployment and underemployment, and inadequate medical services. Successive Lebanese governments have consistently opposed the permanent resettlement of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, and state policies reflect this stance, denying virtually all social and economic rights. In addition, the state has prohibited the expansion of existing refugee camps, which contributes to overcrowding and illegal and unsafe building of additional stories on existing structures. One of the most frequently heard complaints from Palestinians in Lebanon concerns restrictions on the right to work. Palestinians, like other foreigners, must obtain annual work permits from the labor ministry in order to be employed legally. Possession of a work permit affords foreign workers protection under Lebanon's labor law with respect to workers rights and benefits. However, these permits are extremely difficult for Palestinians to obtain: permits are issued annually to Palestinians by the hundreds while for other foreign workers in Lebanon they are issued by the thousands. (Hundreds of thousands of Syrian workers in Lebanon, in contrast, require no work permits.)  The difficulty in obtaining work permits forces many Palestinians into the underground economy and leaves others open to exploitation by private employers. For example, a Palestinian teacher with fourteen years' experience and a university degree from Egypt told Human Rights Watch that Palestinians can obtain teaching jobs in private schools in Lebanon without a work permit, but they earn salaries significantly lower than their Lebanese counterparts and have no job security or worker benefits.  The situation of women workers is particularly difficult.  Palestinian women who work in the garment industry in Beirut and Sidon, for example, are paid below the minimum wage and earn half the salary of Lebanese citizens.  Because the Palestinians do not have work permits, they do not receive the benefits provided to Lebanese employees, including medical insurance.  In addition, various legal barriers prohibit Palestinians from practicing in Lebanon as doctors, pharmacists, engineers, lawyers or journalists. Laws, decrees, and regulations of professional associations specify that members must hold Lebanese nationality for at least ten years or that there must be reciprocity of treatment for Lebanese professionals in the country of citizenship of the foreign professional applying to practice in Lebanon.  For example, the journalists' syndicate restricts membership to those who have been Lebanese citizens for at least ten years, as does the bar association. Medical, pharmacy, and engineering associations in Lebanon all have regulations that require reciprocal treatment as conditions for membership, which by definition excludes Palestinians who are stateless. These rules open the door for exploitation of some Palestinian professionals, such as engineers, who have described to Human Rights Watch how they have obtained """"illegal"""" jobs at Lebanese firms but have no benefits and cannot sign official documents for work that they have supervised. (1) Of the 150,000 Palestinians believed to be residing in EU member states, the majority (about 80,000) are in Germany. Most of them are stateless and hold Palestinian refugee travel documents,  and an estimated 80 percent are from Lebanon, according to Shaml.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/04/23/hrc-general-comment-article-12-iccpr","HRC General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR","HRC General Comment on Article 12 of the ICCPR","","04/23/2002","The Human Rights Committee General Comment on Article 12 of the International Covenant on civil and Political Rights (November 1999)  In November 1999 the Human Rights Committee, the authoritative U.N. body for interpreting the ICCPR, produced a thorough and comprehensive commentary on Article 12.  General Comments of the Human Rights Committee represent the most authoritative interpretation of the Covenant available to State Parties.  They are produced by the Committee as authoritative guidance in order to assist States in fulfilling their reporting requirements (1).  The General Comment concluded:  The wording of article 12, paragraph 4, does not distinguish between nationals and aliens (""""no one""""). Thus, the persons entitled to exercise this right can be identified only by interpreting the meaning of the phrase """"his own country"""".  The scope of """"his own country"""" is broader than the concept """"country of his nationality"""". It is not limited to nationality in a formal sense, that is, nationality acquired at birth or by conferral; it embraces, at the very least, an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien. This would be the case, for example, for nationals of a country who have been stripped of their nationality in violation of international law, and of individuals whose country of nationality has been incorporated in or transferred to another national entity, whose nationality is being denied them.  The language of article 12, paragraph 4, moreover, permits a broader interpretation that might embrace other categories of long-term residents, including but not limited to stateless persons arbitrarily deprived of the right to acquire the nationality of the country of such residence""""  Link to Own Country In summary, the General Comment adopts an inclusive interpretation of """"own country"""" to protect all those with """"special ties"""" or connections with a country -- those who can not be considered """"mere aliens."""" In the view of Human Rights Watch, the clearest guidance in international law for defining the basis on which an individual can exercise a claim to return to his or her """"own country"""" is provided by the convergence of the wording of the General Comments of the Human Rights Committee -- """"an individual who, because of his or her special ties to or claims in relation to a given country, cannot be considered to be a mere alien""""-- and the concept of a """"genuine and effective link,"""" which arose out of the International Court of Justice's Nottebohm case (2).   While the Nottebohm case addressed the issue of nationality, the criteria that it sets forth are the most comprehensive, Human Rights Watch considers, for determining the existence of the right to return.,  it says :  """"Different factors are taken into consideration, and their importance will vary from one case to the next: there is the habitual residence of the individual concerned but also the centre of his interests, his family ties, his participation in public life, attachment shown by him for a given country and inculcated in his children, etc.""""   Thus a """"genuine and effective link"""" to one's """"own country"""" can be composed of various elements, including language, long-term residence, cultural identity, family ties, etc. The right of return is not restricted to nationality in the formal, or de jure, sense. Nor can it be restricted to permanent or habitual residence. One's """"own country"""" implies a broader set of ties and connections that together make up """"a genuine and effective link"""" as defined in the Nottebohm case. It allows for those outside their own country to return for the first time, even if they were born elsewhere and would be entering for the first time, so long as they have maintained a """"genuine and effective link"""" to the country.  A genuine and effective link that is the basis for the right to return could conceivably fade over time. However, this would be rare in the case of those who personally fled. Such a determination should not be made for these individuals before they have had the opportunity to exercise the right to return over a reasonable period of time have chosen not to exercise the right, or have taken steps to cut the link (for example, by renouncing their nationality).  The question of whether the refugees left voluntarily or were expelled does not affect the right to return under the ICCPR.   More..   (1)  Part IV of the ICCPR (Articles 28 - 45) provides for the establishment of a Human Rights Committee to oversee the implementation of the Covenant.  Article 40 stipulates that State Parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on measures they have taken to implement the Covenant.  The Committee can also submit its own reports and """"such general comments as it may consider appropriate, to the States Parties"""" (Article 40 (4)).  The General Comment may also be submitted to the Economic and Social Council.   (2) Nottebohm Case, (Liechtenstein v. Guatemala) Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. reports 1955, Rep 4. The Nottebohm case dealt with the ability of one State (Liechtenstein) to initiate proceedings against another State (Guatemala) before the ICJ on behalf of one of its citizens. What was at stake was Liechtenstein?s ability to extend international protection to Nottebohm, and in order to do that the ?genuine and effective? link between Liechtenstein and Nottebohm needed to be established and specified. The case, and in particular the elements that comprise the ?link?, have been cited innumerable times by scholars, national and international courts - including the World Court - and institutions dealing with the nationality questions.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

The two children, aged nine and ten, were murdered during the night at a so-called """"secure residence"""" in Nairobi where their throats were slit by an assailant. Their forty-three year old mother, who is a close relative of the former president of Rwanda, Juvenal Habyarimana, was also severely injured with multiple stab wounds.   """"This murder is a tragic reminder of the need to provide life-saving protection to refugees in Nairobi,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director of Human Rights Watch.   The residential facility in the Kilimani neighborhood of Nairobi was set up by the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to shelter refugees whose lives are in danger. Some 190 refugees are currently living there. The Rwandan refugee family had been placed in the facility because of the inter-ethnic nature of the family - the mother of the slain children is Hutu and their father is Tutsi, and because of their relationship to Habyarimana. The death of President Habyarimana in April 1994 in a mysterious plane crash provided the pretext for Hutu extremists to launch a campaign of genocide against the minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda in which more than half a million people were killed.   The woman and her two children fled Rwanda in 2000 because their lives were under threat. Three other children from her first marriage had already been murdered in Rwanda. She first fled to Uganda, where her security problems were so acute that she came to Nairobi in May 2001.   Identified as being in urgent need of resettlement to a third country because her life was in danger in Kenya, the woman had waited eleven months for her resettlement application to be processed and only received medical screening for resettlement to Australia a few days ago. The resettlement process in Nairobi is notoriously slow - particularly after a corruption scandal caused UNHCR to replace most of its resettlement staff in March 2001.   """"This case highlights the current failure of UNHCR in Nairobi to provide speedy resettlement for refugees whose lives are at risk. Refugees are forced to wait unacceptable periods of time for resettlement to third countries - in this case, with tragic consequences,"""" said Reilly.  The grave security problems faced by this Rwandan family are typical for many of the refugees living in Nairobi and Kampala, said Reilly. Human Rights Watch is currently investigating human rights abuses against asylum seekers and refugees in both cities. One refugee told Human Rights Watch """"I don't feel safe there [in the UNHCR facility]... I don't feel safe anywhere in Nairobi.""""","Africa, Kenya, Rwanda","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

In trying to keep a political dialogue on track between Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy, and military authorities, he has to convince the country's top generals that a major breakthrough is needed to keep the process alive. Progress might open the door for the expanded humanitarian and other international assistance needed by Burma. Razali's visit was scheduled for March but was deferred after the arrest of four relatives of Ne Win, the 92-year-old former dictator who retired in 1988. The government says they will be put on trial on charges of high treason, a capital offense, for attempting a coup. The coup charges have provided General Than Shwe, a leading figure in the ruling junta, with a convenient pretext to consolidate his grip on power. The arrests and the delay in Razali's trip fueled speculation on a split in the government's top ranks, between """"reformers"""" and """"hard-liners,"""" that could sink any chances of the confidence-building talks with the league moving to serious discussions about a democratic transition. Razali is expected to push for the release of more than 1,000 political prisoners, including hundreds of detained pro-democracy activists and at least 17 members of Parliament elected in 1990. The UN human rights expert on Burma, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, reporting to the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, has stressed that the release of all political prisoners is important """"not only as an end in itself but also because it is regarded by the leadership of the league as a prerequisite for moving to the next phase of talks."""" Pinheiro gave Rangoon credit for freeing more than 200 political detainees since the beginning of last year, while complaining that the process was going much too slowly. He also praised Burma for allowing some league offices to reopen. But just days before the UN commission took up Burma, the government announced a harsh seven-year prison sentence for a retired academic, Salai Tun Than. He was arrested last November for holding a peaceful protest in front of Rangoon City Hall calling for democracy. It appears that the ruling generals are as determined as ever to crush any open dissent, while at the same time carrying on a process of dialogue internally and pursuing engagement externally with the international community. Such a two-track approach is not sustainable. Another key test of the government's willingness to change is its response to the International Labor Organization's demands for an end to forced labor. It has failed to take the necessary steps to halt the army's use of forced labor. The practice continues especially in the building of infastructure projects and in certain ethnic minority areas. If the Razali visit is to have any chance of success, the pressure on Burma must be maintained, and not only by Western governments. Japan and the Association of South East Asian Nations should also be actively involved in persuading the generals to end the current impasse.  Mike Jendrzecjzyk is Washington D.C.

The organization has written to President Obasanjo in response to recent statements he made to the media, in which he dismissed Human Rights Watch’s report on the killings in Benue. “By dismissing our report in this way, President Obasanjo is effectively dismissing the gravity of the military killings in Benue,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.  On April 1, 2002, Human Rights Watch published a detailed report on its investigation in several towns and villages in Benue State, in which the army killed more than 200 unarmed civilians and carried out widespread destruction on October 22 to 24, 2001. The military operation was launched following the murder of nineteen soldiers, which was attributed to armed men of the Tiv ethnic group. These events took place against the backdrop of a longstanding armed conflict between the Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups.  In a report by the United Nations Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) on April 17, based on information from the Panafrican News Agency PANA, President Obasanjo was quoted as saying: “I have dismissed the [Human Rights Watch] report with the contempt it deserves because it failed to condemn the killing of soldiers who were sent to separate the feuding Jukuns and Tivs. […] Is it only when soldiers kill civilians that you talk about human rights? Were the nineteen soldiers beheaded not human beings?”  Yet the Human Rights Watch report states clearly: “Human Rights Watch also strongly condemns the abduction, killing, and mutilation of the nineteen soldiers on October 10 and urges that those responsible for those acts be brought to justice. However, the brutality of that incident cannot justify the killings and destruction in the military reprisals that followed.”  “We deeply regret that in addition to misrepresenting the contents of our report, President Obasanjo is still refusing to condemn the massacre by the Nigerian military,” said Takirambudde. “The reprisal killings carried out by the army constitute grave human rights violations for which President Obasanjo should not allow the perpetrators to escape with impunity.”  In an interview with the Financial Times, on 9 April, President Obasanjo also failed to condemn the military massacre and spoke about “cause and effect.” Referring to the murder of the nineteen soldiers, he said: “You don’t expect me to fold my hands and do nothing because tomorrow neither soldiers nor policemen will go anywhere I send them. I sent soldiers. When you send soldiers they do not go there on picnic. They went on operation.” He told the journalist who asked what had gone wrong in Benue: “This is the kind of thing one finds really irritating coming from people like you. Those soldiers, are they not human? Have they no rights, too? […] Action and reaction are not equal and opposite […] In human nature, reaction is always more than action.”  “President Obasanjo’s comments do not inspire confidence that those responsible will be brought to justice,” said Peter Takirambudde. A commission of inquiry has been set up to investigate events in Benue, but its remit is vague and does not include any specific reference to the actions of the military.  “We are appealing to President Obasanjo to acknowledge that serious violations were committed by the military in Benue and ensure that those responsible for ordering and carrying out the killings are brought to justice without delay,” Takirambudde said. “By seeming to excuse one of the most serious human rights violations by the army since this government came to power, President Obasanjo is undermining any attempts to restore respect for human rights in Nigeria.”","Africa, Nigeria",""

Individuals in Turkey face prosecution and prison terms merely for using forbidden minority languages or expressing opinions on certain taboo subjects. The European Union indicated that it expected Turkey to resolve its free expression problems by March 2002. Recent months have seen the Turkish government trying to meet that goal with legislative half-measures that have brought little real change. The following are answers to basic questions about respect for the right to free expression and language rights in Turkey. Which laws affect the right to free expression? The Turkish Human Rights Association has calculated that Turkish law and regulations contain more than 300 provisions constraining freedom of expression, religion, and association. Many of the repressive provisions found in the Press Law, the Political Parties Law, the Trade Union Law, the Law on Associations, and other legislation were imposed by the military junta after its coup in 1980. Article 312 of the Turkish criminal code imposes three-year prison sentences for incitement to commit an offence and incitement to religious or racial hatred. Turkish courts have had a very idiosyncratic view of what counts as incitement to hatred. In 1999 the mayor of Istanbul Recep Tayyip Erdogan was sentenced to 10 months' imprisonment under Article 312 for reading a few lines from a poem that had been authorized by the Ministry of Education for use in schools. With his conviction, he had to forfeit his status as mayor. In 2000 Akin Birdal was imprisoned under Article 312 for a speech in which he called for """"peace and understanding"""" between Kurds and Turks. He was obliged to resign his post as president of the Turkish Human Rights Association, as the Law on Associations forbids persons who breach this and several other laws from serving as association officials. Article 159 of the criminal code imposes three-year prison sentences for insulting """"Turkishness, the Republic, the Grand National Assembly, the spiritual personality of the government, ministries, the military, security forces or judiciary of the state."""" Most of the thirty-seven people known to Human Rights Watch as currently facing proceedings under Article 159 are journalists, but the list also includes three human rights defenders and the president of the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce, who is accused of insulting the National Security Council. In March 2001, nineteen organizers and speakers of a conference on sexual assault and rape in custody were put on trial in Istanbul for """"insulting the State authorities."""" One of those charged was a nurse who had been tortured and raped with a truncheon in police custody in 1992. This trial continues, along with proceedings against the Women Pensioners' Union, which published the conference proceedings in a book entitled Voice and Courage. Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law (Law 3713) imposes three-year prison sentences for """"separatist propaganda."""" Despite its name, the Anti-Terror Law punishes many non-violent offences. Those imprisoned under Article 8 for their non-violent statements have included pacifists and people who strongly and publicly criticize political violence. The publisher Fatih Tas was recently prosecuted under Article 8 at Istanbul State Security Court for translating and publishing writings by Noam Chomsky, summarizing the history of human rights violations in southeast Turkey. On February 13, the Court acquitted Tas. """"Undermining the institution of military service"""" can bring one two years in prison. For """"insulting the memory"""" of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish republic, one can pay with up to seven and a half years in prison under the Law to Protect Ataturk. The authorities often decide to use even harsher laws to punish non-violent statements. During the crisis following the killing of twenty-eight prisoners in transfers into small-group isolation at F-type prisons in December 2000, the Justice Ministry announced that statements deemed as supporting the prisoners' hunger-strikes would be prosecuted as """"support for an illegal armed organization"""" under Article 169 of the criminal code. The president and board members of the Ankara branch of the Human Rights Association are currently on trial at Ankara State Security Court for making a public statement about the prison crisis in January 2001. If convicted they face prison sentences of up to seven and a half years. Nineteen participants in a protest against F-type prisons at Ankara University were sentenced to three years and nine months on February 7, 2001. They will serve their sentences in F-type prisons. What is the state of the Turkish language media? Turkey has a very lively media. Newspapers and television programs include strong criticism of government and government policy. Discussion programs range freely over almost every conceivable topic. But three topics are potentially hazardous: Turkish secularism and the limits imposed on religion in politics; minority rights and the role of ethnicity in politics; and the role of the military in politics. Statements on such topics may well provoke prosecution and imprisonment. A clear example of this were last year's convictions and prison sentences imposed on three party leaders: Necmettin Erbakan former president of the banned religion-based Welfare Party; Murat Bozlak, former president of the mainly Kurdish People's Democracy Party (HADEP); and Hasan Celal Guzel, former Minister of State, former Minister of Education, founder and president of the Rebirth Party, and persistent critic of the military's influence in politics. The Turkish government avoided the embarrassment of imprisoning the political leaders by enacting a partial amnesty in December 2001. The threat of such prosecutions is an extremely effective curb on politicians, since conviction for expression offences not only means they may serve a prison sentence, but also that they forever forfeit their right to participate in politics. Are there restrictions on the Kurdish language media? There is no legal obstacle to publishing newspapers and magazines in Kurdish, but the authorities confiscate these publications and prosecute their publishers on charges of separatism. In January 2000, Turkish embassies abroad circulated a list of Kurdish magazines, books, music cassettes, and radio stations, which the government claimed was an """"important indicator of the wide and free use of the Kurdish language in Turkey."""" All ten magazines were published legally, but the authorities had repeatedly confiscated five of the ten magazines, detained and imprisoned their staff and distributors, and forbidden any issues of the magazines to enter the mainly Kurdish provinces governed under state of emergency legislation. The High Council for Radio and Television (RTÜK), on which the military is represented, has deemed radio broadcasting in Kurdish unacceptable. The Law on the Organization and Broadcasts of Radio and Television Stations (Statute 3984) requires all broadcasting to be in Turkish. Non-Turkish languages are permitted if they have """"made a contribution to the development of universal culture or works of science,"""" a formulation apparently designed to exclude Kurdish. Radio stations are constantly testing the limits set by RTÜK. The authorities sometimes tolerate this, but sometimes punish stations with expensive broadcasting bans. Of the ten radio stations on the embassies' list of those providing broadcasts in Kurdish, RTÜK has banned Radio Metro in Diyarbakir for six months, Show Radio in Mardin for nine months, and Radio Karacadag in Sanliurfa for three years. In February 2002, RTÜK banned Gün [Day] Radio in Diyarbakir for two years for broadcasting songs in Kurdish, some of which were critical of the military, but a local court subsequently reversed one of those rulings. In recent months politicians have signalled openness to the prospect of Kurdish language broadcasting. This may in part be an effort to counteract the influence of MED-TV, a Kurdish language station broadcast from Europe via satellite. Many Kurds watch its programs, which are considered sympathetic to the illegal armed group Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK). The Turkish army runs Dicle'nin Sesi (Voice of the Tigris) radio station, broadcasting in two Kurdish dialects. In March the government submitted a bill to parliament in order to permit the state television channel TRT to broadcast an hour's news a day in Kurdish. Music cassettes in Kurdish can be found legally on open sale in Istanbul and Diyarbakir, but occasional police purges result in mass confiscations of such cassettes. Local governors circulate lists of cassettes banned from sale in city markets. In November 2001 police in Batman, southeast Turkey, presented shopkeepers with a list of ninety-one banned cassettes, the majority in the Kurdish language.  Are there restrictions on Kurdish people freely speaking their language? Yes. Kurds and members of Turkey's many other ethnic minorities speak their own language at home and in the street and have always done so, but significant restrictions remain in other parts of Turkish life. For example, people cannot use minority languages in the political arena. Article 81 of the Political Parties Law (imposed by the military junta in 1982) forbids parties from using any language other than Turkish in their written material or at any formal or public meetings. This law is strictly enforced. Public meetings are usually videotaped by the police so that legal action can be taken if there is any breach of the law. For the party, the risk is possible closure by the Constitutional Court. For the individual politician, speaking Kurdish in a public setting can be very hazardous. When elected to parliament in October 1991 for the Democracy Party (DEP), Leyla Zana took the oath of loyalty in Turkish, as required, but added in Kurdish: """"I have completed this formality under duress. I shall struggle so that the Kurdish and Turkish peoples can live peacefully together in a democratic framework."""" The parliamentary chamber erupted with calls for her arrest and hanging as a separatist and traitor. Leyla Zana's use of Kurdish triggered legal proceedings against her and her DEP colleagues. In 1994, DEP was closed for """"separatism"""" and, after a trial that did not meet international standards for fairness, Ankara State Security Court sentenced Leyla Zana and three other DEP members of parliament to fifteen years' imprisonment for """"membership of an armed organization."""" They are still imprisoned in Ankara Central Closed Prison. In July 2001, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that their trial had been unfair. In January 2002, the General Secretary of the Council of Europe Walter Schwimmer called on Turkey to abide by the ruling of the court and order a new trial. In late 2001, the Interior Minister sent out a circular requiring provincial governors to ensure that parents name their children """"[i]n a manner appropriate to our national culture, moral values and customs"""" as required by the Civil Registration Law. In February and March, prosecutors opened actions against eight families who had given their children Kurdish names, requiring them to change the names to traditional Turkish names. What restrictions are placed on the Kurdish language in schools? Article 42(9) of the Turkish constitution states: """"No language other than Turkish shall be taught as a mother tongue to Turkish citizens at any institutions of training or education. Foreign languages to be taught in institutions of training and education and the rules to be followed by schools conducting training and education in a foreign language shall be determined by law."""" According to the Foreign Language Education and Teaching Law of October 1983, which regulates the teaching of languages other than Turkish, the National Security Council (comprised of the president, ministers, and leaders of the armed forces) decides which languages may be taught. At present, only English, French, German, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese may be taught. This ruling applies to public and private institutions. Constitutional amendments adopted in October 2001 removed mention of """"language forbidden by law"""" from legal provisions concerning free expression. Thereafter, university students began a campaign for optional courses in Kurdish to be put on the university curriculum, triggering more than 1,000 detentions throughout Turkey during December and January 2002. Scores of students reported that police tortured or otherwise ill-treated them during incommunicado detention. One hundred and forty people, most of them students, who submitted petitions concerning optional language classes, are now in custody awaiting trial. It is likely that they will be charged under the Anti-Terror Law, because the authorities claim that the PKK is behind the language education campaign. The PKK conducted armed opposition against Turkish security forces in the mainly Kurdish southeast from 1984 until 1999, when the PKK declared a unilateral ceasefire. Several hundred other students have been suspended for a year or more from higher education because they submitted petitions inviting the university authorities to add Kurdish language to the curriculum. Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit has said that the teaching of Kurdish language in universities is """"impossible,"""" and is no more than a ruse to divide the nation. The Higher Education Council (YÖK), which is responsible for university administration (and on which the military is represented), has so far suspended forty-six students submitting petitions for Kurdish language courses. Are these restrictions founded in racial tension between Kurds and Turks? Is there a history of intercommunal violence? No. Even during the years of bitter conflict between the PKK and the government, incidents of violence based on ethnic identity were almost unknown. Do other ethnic minorities face restrictions on the use of their language? Prosecutors have at times taken action against publications by the Laz minority, who originate from the Black Sea region and speak a language related to Georgian. The Turkish government accepts the language rights of the Jewish, Greek and Armenian minorities as being guaranteed by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne. But the government claims that these are Turkey's only minorities, and that any talk of minority rights beyond this is just separatism. The Turkish Foreign Ministry website says: """"The status of minorities in Turkey has been internationally certified by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, according to which there are only non-Muslim minorities in Turkey. It is wrong, according to this definition, to refer to our citizens of Kurdish descent as a 'Kurdish minority.'"""" The government ignores Article 39(4) of the Treaty of Lausanne, which states that: """"[n]o restrictions shall be imposed on the free use by any Turkish national of any language in private intercourse, in commerce, religion, in the press or in publications of any kind or at public meetings."""" Are there any moves to remove restrictions on freedom of expression? Many in the Turkish press, public, and political elite recognize that the limits imposed on free expression are unacceptable. Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a judge and former president of the constitutional court, was elected president of the Turkish Republic in May 2000, after he had made a series of bold speeches calling for the constitution and legal system of Turkey to be """"cleansed"""" of their repressive features. He continued this theme in his inaugural speech: """"We must swiftly integrate modern democracy into the fabric of our political life and the principle of rule of law into the fabric of our state structure. We cannot meet the demands of a modern society without abandoning the structure and regulations that bring to mind a police state."""" Unfortunately, government ministers who applauded this speech have done almost nothing to dismantle the battery of laws that restrict freedom of expression and inhibit political life. As has happened with every government since the return to civilian rule in 1983, nearly every reform eliminating some restrictive measures has been countered by the introduction of other repressive legislation or the courts' resorting to other existing articles of the criminal code. In 1991 the government repealed laws outlawing communist beliefs (Articles 141 and 142 of the criminal code) and Islamic fundamentalist ideas (Article 163 of the criminal code). This package of legal changes substantially freed up expression of leftist thought, but simultaneously created a new offence of """"separatist propaganda"""" under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law. Prosecutors also began to use Article 312 of the criminal code in place of Article 163. In 1995 the government slightly amended Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, but as a practical matter there were no changes. The academic Fikret Baskaya, for example, is even now serving a one-year four-month sentence under that revised wording because of a newspaper article he wrote concerning the trial of Abdullah Öcalan, leader of the PKK. On February 6, 2002, the Turkish parliament passed a """"mini-democracy package"""" that altered the wording of Article 312. Under the revised text, incitement can only be punished if it presents """"a possible threat to public order."""" The package also reduced the prison sentences for Article 159 of the criminal code from a maximum of six years to three years. None of the other laws have been amended or repealed. The judiciary has the power to transform the situation. Expressions of non-violent opinion are safeguarded by Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, ratified by Turkey in 1954, and various provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed by Turkey in 2000. Many Turkish citizens convicted under the laws mentioned above have applied to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) and won their cases. According to Article 90 of the Turkish Constitution, provisions of international treaties take precedence over Turkish domestic law. Judges should therefore reflect the European Human Rights Convention in their judgments. It is unfortunate that prosecutors and judges, in their interpretations of Turkish law, have persistently ignored the jurisprudence of the ECHR and its succession of judgments against Turkey on matters of free expression. What is the European Union's position on the use of minority languages and freedom of expression in Turkey? In 1999 the European Union (E.U.) recognized Turkey as a candidate for membership, with the proviso that Turkey cannot begin negotiations for full membership until it has met the political conditions for membership (the Copenhagen Criteria) that require """"stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights, and respect for and protection of minorities."""" In 2000 the E.U. presented Turkey with its requirements for fulfilment of the criteria in the form of an Accession Partnership document. Turkey answered in 2001 with its National Plan, in which the Turkish government attempted to bargain down the E.U.'s demands. On the general question of freedom of expression, the E.U. asked that in the """"short term"""" Turkey strengthen legal and constitutional guarantees for the rights of freedom of expression and association in line with Article 10 of the European Convention. In the context of the E.U. accession process, the """"short term"""" is normally interpreted as one year from the presentation of the National Plan, which elapsed for Turkey in March 2002. Turkey responded by promising only to """"review"""" Article 312 of the criminal law, Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and the Press Law. A year later Article 312 has been slightly altered; Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law and the Press Law remain unchanged. On the specific issue of minority language broadcasting, the E.U. asked Turkey to remove legal provisions forbidding the use by Turkish citizens of their mother tongue in TV and radio broadcasting. Turkey promised to review the Broadcasting Law, but has failed to do so, and RTÜK continues to impose a large number of closure orders on TV and radio stations on the grounds that they have made separatist broadcasts. In August 2001, RTÜK banned the BBC World Service and the Deutsche Welle on the grounds that their broadcasts """"threatened national security."""" Turkey's human rights record is marred by its severe restrictions on the right to freedom of expression. Individuals in Turkey face prosecution and prison terms merely for using forbidden minority languages or expressing opinions on certain taboo subjects. The European Union indicated that it expected Turkey to resolve its free expression problems by March 2002. Recent months have seen the Turkish government trying to meet that goal with legislative half-measures that have brought little real change. The following are answers to basic questions about respect for the right to free expression and language rights in Turkey.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye","Free Speech"

The report, entitled """"Military Revenge in Benue: A Population Under Attack,"""" contains details of our investigations in several towns and villages in Benue State, in which Nigerian soldiers killed more than two hundred unarmed civilians and carried out widespread destruction on October 22 to 24, 2001, following the murder of nineteen soldiers attributed to a Tiv armed group. The report also clearly condemns the abduction and killing of the soldiers.   We are very concerned that in public statements and interviews granted to journalists, including in the last few days, you do not appear to have acknowledged the gravity of these killings by the military in Benue and have focused instead, and almost exclusively, on the killing of the nineteen soldiers. Yet the reprisal killings carried out by the army constitute grave human rights violations, which should receive an appropriate response from you and your government, in line with Nigeria's obligations under international human rights law.   Most recently, in a report by the United Nations Integrated Regional Information Network (IRIN) on April 17, based on information from the Panafrican News Agency PANA, you are quoted as saying: """"I have dismissed the [Human Rights Watch] report with the contempt it deserves because it failed to condemn the killing of soldiers who were sent to separate the feuding Jukuns and Tivs. [...] Is it only when soldiers kill civilians that you talk about human rights? Were the nineteen soldiers beheaded not human beings?""""   This is a misrepresentation of our report, which states clearly, on page 3: """"Human Rights Watch also strongly condemns the abduction, killing, and mutilation of the nineteen soldiers on October 10 and urges that those responsible for those acts be brought to justice. However, the brutality of that incident cannot justify the killings and destruction in the military reprisals that followed."""" The report also describes the background to the deployment of the soldiers in the area and includes a section on the conflict between Tivs and Jukuns (section V, pages 16 to 18).   We deeply regret that in addition to misrepresenting the contents of our report, you still appear to be refusing to condemn publicly the massacre and destruction by the Nigerian military or to give a firm, unambiguous commitment to bringing those responsible to justice.   In an interview with the Financial Times, on 9 April 2002, you similarly failed to condemn these actions, speaking instead about """"cause and effect."""" Referring to the murder of the nineteen soldiers, you are quoted as saying: """"You don't expect me to fold my hands and do nothing because tomorrow neither soldiers nor policemen will go anywhere I send them. I sent soldiers. When you send soldiers they do not go there on picnic. They went on operation."""" You are also quoted as saying to the journalist who asked you what had gone wrong in Benue: """"This is the kind of thing one finds really irritating coming from people like you. Those soldiers, are they not human? Have they no rights, too? [...] Action and reaction are not equal and opposite [...] In human nature, reaction is always more than action.""""   Such comments do not inspire confidence that those responsible for the massacres will be brought to justice. We are aware that a commission of inquiry has been set up to investigate events in Benue, and we await its outcome; however, we are concerned about the vagueness of its remit and the absence of any specific reference to the need to investigate the actions of the military.   In the meantime, by seeming to excuse one of the most serious cases of human rights violations by the army since your government came to power, such public statements on the Benue massacres are likely to undermine any attempts to restore respect for human rights in Nigeria.   Human Rights Watch is appealing to you and to the Nigerian government to acknowledge that serious violations were committed by the military in Benue, to refrain from making public statements which could be interpreted as justifications for these violations, and to ensure that those responsible for ordering and carrying out the killings are brought to justice without delay. We also urge you to implement the other recommendations in the enclosed report and we would be grateful for information from your government on any progress made, particularly concerning investigation and prosecution.

While we recognize that neither institution yet exists and that arrangements between the institutions will need to be agreed upon by the institutions themselves, we circulate this paper with the hope of stimulating discussion so that these issues may be addressed in the future. After three general observations, Part I discusses information sharing from the TRC to the Special Court. Part II discusses information sharing from the Special Court to the TRC. Finally, Part III discusses the mechanics of how the information sharing would occur.   General ObservationsRecommendations &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI. Information Sharing from the TRC to the Special Court &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspII. Information Sharing from the Special Court to the TRC &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIII. Mechanisms for Sharing Information  General Observations  Three general observations underlie our basic approach to the interaction between the TRC and the Special Court. First, Human Rights Watch believes that it is important for the institutions to conclude a written agreement that permits them to interact cooperatively. Second, we believe that the institutions should, when possible, share, not duplicate, each other's efforts. Third, we believe that the Special Court should refrain from subpoenaing the TRC.   1. Human Rights Watch fully agrees with the Planning Mission Report that arrangements between the institutions should be finalized, so that the institutions may have a cooperative relationship.    The recent Planning Mission Report recognizes the need for the conclusion of cooperative arrangements between the TRC and the Special Court, and notes general agreement by experts convened to discuss the relationship between the Special Court and TRC that the institutions should """"perform complementary roles"""" that are """"mutually supportive"""" and """"in full respect for each other's mandate.""""[1]   We also believe both institutions have important roles, and should work in a mutually supportive way. Given the limited resources of both institutions and the immense work before them, the importance of the institutions working cooperatively cannot be overemphasized.   Since the Planning Mission Report was written, however, Sierra Leone has enacted an implementing law for the Special Court that affects the relationship between the institutions. Specifically, the Special Court Agreement 2002 (Ratification) Act 2002 (hereafter, the """"Implementing Law"""") states in Section 21(2): """"Notwithstanding any other law, every natural person, corporation, or other body created by or under Sierra Leone law shall comply with any direction specified in an order of the Special Court."""" Because the TRC is a body created under Sierra Leonean law,[2] the Implementing Law creates a duty for the TRC to comply with orders of the Special Court. Because there are no exceptions stated in the Implementing Law, the implications are that the TRC would have to comply with all orders of the Special Court.   The TRC Act on its face permits the TRC to receive information on a confidential basis.[3] However, because the Implementing Law is later in time and also states that it applies """"[n]otwithstanding any other law,"""" the Implementing Law would presumably trump the TRC Act. This suggests that the Special Court could require the TRC to produce even """"confidential"""" materials.   The implications of that are troubling, and are at odds with the relationship between the institutions that was envisioned in the Planning Mission Report. We fear that if no """"confidential"""" information received by the TRC is treated as """"confidential,"""" that could potentially undermine the willingness of persons to come before the TRC to provide testimony.   As a policy matter, Human Rights Watch believes that in order for the institutions to operate to their best advantage, have a cooperative relationship, and, most importantly, provide effective redress to the people of Sierra Leone, the institutions will need to finalize an agreement regarding their approach to information sharing.   It would be unfair for witnesses not to know conclusively how information that is being provided to the TRC would be treated, and whether """"confidentiality"""" that is granted by the TRC is to have any meaning. Thus, any agreement between the Special Court and TRC should be concluded as soon as those institutions are in a position to do so, so that the public can be informed as to how the institutions will interact, and, more importantly, people who are providing information to the institutions will know how that information can be used.   2. Human Rights Watch believes that certain cooperation should go beyond what is envisioned in the Planning Mission Report, so that the institutions do not duplicate each other's efforts when witness confidentiality is not an issue.   The Planning Mission Report suggests that the TRC should share with the Special Court """"confidential"""" material provided to the TRC only where the information can """"only be obtained from"""" the TRC and the information is """"essential for the conviction or acquittal of the accused.""""[4] We agree with that approach. It both seeks to preserve the """"confidentiality"""" of most confidential materials, yet allows the Special Court to trump that confidentiality to prevent a miscarriage of justice.   Our main difference with the approach suggested by the Planning Mission Report is that we believe that, where there is no issue of """"confidentiality"""" or where sharing of information would not compromise an ongoing Special Court investigation or reveal privileged information, the institutions should be able to freely share information, including sharing information from the Special Court to the TRC. (See Parts I.B. and II below.)   The reason for our divergence from the Planning Mission approach stems from a concern that both institutions will face serious resource and time constraints and thus should not be compelled to perform duplicative work where there is no issue of witness confidentiality or similarly compelling reason. The Special Court is initially budgeted to operate for only three years. The TRC will operate for only twelve to eighteen months, and its mandate is to cover events during an eight year period. Due to the extensive nature of the crimes that have been committed and the time periods over which those crimes occurred, both institutions will have a great deal of work to perform in a short time. Accordingly, we believe that the institutions should benefit from the fact that their efforts will sometimes overlap, rather than have to replicate each other's efforts.   3. We believe that the Special Court should subpoena the TRC only as a last resort.   The Planning Mission does not discuss mechanisms for sharing information between the two institutions, and the Implementing Law suggests only that the Special Court will be able to subpoena the TRC.   Rather than having the Special Court utilize its subpoena powers against the TRC, we believe that information sharing (which we advocate should occur not only from the TRC to the Special Court but vice versa) should be accomplished on a more cooperative basis. As discussed below, we believe that information sharing could be handled by liaison persons who would be appointed by the institutions. (See Part III.B-C below.)   Using subpoenas would waste precious resources in drafting document requests and responding to them, and most likely create an unduly litigious and hostile relationship.   Using subpoenas would also encourage unnecessary disputes between the institutions. For example, the Special Court might subpoena the TRC for """"confidential"""" information and the TRC might resist the subpoena, or it might resist producing non-confidential information on the grounds that the request was overbroad. Alternatively, the TRC might attempt to subpoena the Special Court, although it is unlikely that it has power to do so.[5] Yet, there is no adjudicatory body that seems appropriate to resolve any dispute that, for example, might require ordering the Special Court to take a particular action.[6] More importantly, any discovery battle between the institutions would waste their resources, could diminish the institutions in the eyes of the public, and would be an utterly unnecessary divergence from the institutions' key mandate-to provide redress to the people of Sierra Leone.  Recommendations I. Information Sharing from the TRC to the Special Court  A. Human Rights Watch supports the suggestion in the Planning Mission Report that witness testimony provided at closed TRC sessions and statements taken on a confidential basis should generally remain confidential, and only be disclosed to the Special Court in limited circumstances.   The TRC Act provides that, at the discretion of the Commission, information may be provided to the TRC confidentially; it also provides for testimony to be given at closed TRC Sessions.[7] While, as detailed above, we believe that that portion of the TRC Act may be trumped by passage of the Implementing Law for the Special Court, we believe that every effort should be made to preserve the TRC's ability to maintain such information as confidential as long as that would not result in a miscarriage of justice before the Special Court.   For policy reasons, we believe that both institutions should reach an agreement that would strike the right balance between the TRC's need to treat information as confidential and the Special Court's occasional need to trump such confidentiality.   We agree with the suggestion made in the Planning Mission Report that the Special Court should only obtain """"confidential"""" information from the TRC in the following circumstances: """"(i) the information or evidentiary material sought can only be obtained from the TRC, and (ii) the evidentiary material requested is essential for the conviction or acquittal of the accused.""""[8]   These criteria should be adopted in an agreement to be concluded between the Special Court and TRC. If the criteria are adopted, they should be explained both in any general information sessions about the TRC and Special Court, and when a witness provides confidential information to the TRC. Thus, potential TRC witnesses would need to be informed that even """"confidential"""" information could be disclosed in those extremely limited circumstances.[9] By limiting disclosure to such situations, witness incentives to provide confidential information to the TRC would hopefully not be diminished significantly.[10]   As to how the Special Court[11] would know whether the TRC has confidential information that is relevant to Special Court proceedings, details of how the information sharing would work are discussed in Part III below.   B. Witness statements taken by the TRC where confidential treatment is not requested should be readily available to the Special Court.   As mentioned above, Human Rights Watch takes a different view than the Planning Mission regarding witness statements taken by TRC personnel where no confidential treatment is requested. We believe such information should be available to the Special Court.[12]   Given the extremely short time periods that the two institutions will function and the huge workloads facing them, we believe that the institutions should share information when feasible. Thus, for instance, if the TRC interviews all the inhabitants of a certain village as to whether a certain massacre occurred, that information could be relevant to proceedings before the Special Court. While the information might not directly implicate any particular defendant, it might, for example, be relevant to establishing whether alleged crimes against humanity were """"systematic or widespread."""" Although witness statements alone would not be that useful as evidence,[13] they might provide Special Court investigators with a starting point for their work. It would be wasteful and unnecessary for the institutions to duplicate each other's work.   Thus, the TRC would explain to a potential witness that there are two ways to provide information to the TRC: (a) confidentially, or (b) not confidentially. Information that the TRC agrees to treat as confidential would only be disclosed to the Special Court under the extremely limited circumstances set forth above. Information not provided confidentially could readily be disclosed if the Special Court-or more precisely, the prosecution or defense, through the appropriate liaison person (see Part III below)-requested it. Again, that non-confidential information could be shared with the Special Court if requested by the Special Court should be explained as part of any public information campaign regarding the institutions once such an agreement is reached.   C. Witness testimony provided at public TRC sessions should be available to the Special Court.   Testimony that witnesses provide to the TRC under their own names in open TRC Sessions and other materials made public by the TRC should be available to the Special Court.[14] Because such information will be in the public domain, there is no reason why the Special Court should not be able to utilize it.   Depending on how the TRC's work is made available to the public, perhaps the Special Court could obtain it through that same medium. A person providing testimony to the TRC in an open session would probably need to be informed that information provided could be utilized by the Special Court.   D. Documentary evidence gathered by the TRC should be readily available to the Special Court.   Documents gathered by the TRC[15]-not witness statements taken by the TRC, but underlying documents-should also be available to the Special Court.[16] If the TRC subpoenas documents from a source, and the Special Court also wishes to obtain some or all of those documents, it seems wasteful to require the Special Court to issue a second subpoena to that source. In fact, if the originals of the documents were turned over to the TRC, the person or entity subpoenaed might not have documents to produce to the Special Court. The Special Court should have the option of obtaining some or all of the documents from the TRC. Allowing sharing of documents also prevents competition between the institutions as to who will subpoena particular documents first.   E. It should be left to the discretion of the TRC whether they wish to reveal information that has not resulted in a public document, or that contains mental impressions or legal theories-i.e., work-product.   As to work that the TRC has done that has not resulted in a public document or that contains mental impressions or legal theories-i.e., work-product-it should be left to the discretion of the TRC whether to share such information. To mandate sharing of this type of information could require providing information that was not yet intended for outside viewing. On the other hand, if the TRC staff wish to share such work with the Special Court, they should be permitted to do so.[17]  II. Information Sharing from the Special Court to the TRC  While the Planning Mission Report, the TRC Act and the Implementing Law do not address the topic, we believe that it is also important to examine the issue of information sharing from the Special Court to the TRC. Because the work of the institutions will overlap, it is quite likely that the Special Court will perform work that could be relevant to the TRC, and from which the TRC might benefit. Again, given the limited resources of both institutions and the huge amount of work facing them, we believe that such information sharing, especially regarding initial background work, should be encouraged. The proposals discussed in II.A-B below would require an agreement between the institutions to implement since there currently is no requirement for the Special Court to share any information with the TRC.   A. Witness statements made to Special Court personnel should be available to the TRC as long as disclosure would not compromise the Special Court's work or reveal privileged materials, and the witness consents.   Currently, the Special Court has no clear obligations to share any information with the TRC. As a policy matter, however, Human Rights Watch believes that witness statements made out of court to Special Court investigators that the TRC wishes to obtain should be available to the TRC if disclosure would not compromise the Special Court's work or reveal privileged materials and the witness consents.   If there is information sharing from the Special Court to the TRC, the Office of the Prosecutor would, however, need the ability to decline to share information-or request that the TRC hold off from public disclosure of certain information-if disclosure of such information would prejudice an investigation or case before the Special Court.[18] To the extent witness statements contain work-product of investigators or attorneys, there should be no disclosure of those statements or portions of those statements.[19]   Special Court investigators who interview witnesses should give them the option of withholding consent to disclosure of their statements to the TRC. The witnesses should also be informed of the possibility of having the TRC treat their information as confidential, and what that would mean.[20] Because individuals who provide statements to Special Court investigators may not in fact testify before the Special Court, they may not wish to share information with the TRC or may request that the TRC treat their information confidentially.   B. Documents gathered by the Special Court but not used at trial should be available to the TRC unless disclosure would compromise the Special Court's work.   In the course of their work, Special Court investigators and prosecutors may obtain documents from individuals. If those documents are relevant to a matter as to which the TRC is hearing testimony or investigating, the TRC may want to obtain those documents. As a policy matter, the TRC should be allowed to view or copy such documents as long as disclosure of the documents would not compromise the work of the Special Court. Had the TRC been the first on the scene, it would have been able to subpoena the documents. A situation should not be created where the TRC has incentive to subpoena documents as soon as possible because it is unable to access them once they are obtained by the Special Court.   A situation might arise, however, where disclosure of certain documents to the TRC could result in information becoming publicly known before the Special Court would want to disclose it. The Special Court should have the leeway to require that the TRC hold-off from using such documents. Such concerns are heightened when a matter under investigation has not resulted in a public indictment. In such a situation, disclosure and use of any relevant documents by the TRC could potentially reveal the subject matter of the Special Court's investigation, and potentially cause a defendant (who might become the subject of a sealed indictment or who already is the subject of a sealed indictment) to flee the country. Thus, the Special Court should have the right to withhold documents that would compromise an ongoing investigation.   C. The TRC should not be able to obtain work-product or material covered by the attorney-client privilege.   If the Special Court does provide information to the TRC, it would be important to note that the TRC should not be allowed to obtain information covered by the attorney-client privilege, or attorney work-product, i.e., material which contains mental impressions or legal theories.[21]  III. Mechanisms for Sharing Information  Equally important as developing guidelines for sharing information between the two institutions is developing a mechanism to accomplish that sharing of information. Human Rights Watch advocates that the two institutions develop a cooperative relationship that will facilitate information sharing without the need for formal subpoenas.[22]   A. The Special Court should attempt to work cooperatively with the TRC and not use its subpoena powers.   As the law currently stands, the Special Court can subpoena the TRC,[23] but the TRC most likely cannot subpoena the Special Court.[24] Regardless of the ability to issue subpoenas, we believe that, as a policy matter, it would be preferable for both institutions to engage in informal information sharing.   Informal information sharing would potentially avoid:  wasting resources on drafting document requests and responding to them; creating disputes between the two bodies, which could require intervention of some adjudicatory body to resolve; creating an unduly adversarial relationship; and having to litigate disclosure disputes that would distract from the real work of the institutions.  Accordingly, as part of any agreement between the Special Court and TRC on information sharing, we believe that both institutions should commit to trying to interact through cooperative means.   B. Liaison persons from the institutions could meet at periodic sessions, perhaps every month, and work out information exchanges.   If the TRC and Special Court agree to informal information sharing, they should designate liaison persons for that purpose. The liaison persons might meet, for example, at least once a month to facilitate disclosure. Such meetings could be used to keep persons at one institution briefed on the work of the other institution. For instance, as to information that would not otherwise be public, persons would not know to seek disclosure unless the other institution let it be known (even if in the most general terms) that it had information on a certain topic.   Informal meetings also seem more conducive to facilitating disclosure of only that information which is really needed, and avoiding large-scale production of information that could waste resources of the institution gathering the information and the institution receiving it.   C. The Special Court should appoint separate liaisons to handle information sharing for the prosecution and defense.   Obviously, investigators and prosecutors in the Special Court's Office of the Prosecutor will be interested in obtaining information from the TRC, and will be knowledgeable about information that the Office of the Prosecutor has that might be useful to the TRC.   Defense counsel, however, must be included in the information sharing process. Consideration should be given to appointing a person from the Registry to be the liaison person between the TRC and defense counsel who might seek information from the TRC. Because ICTR rules require the prosecution to disclose exculpatory evidence to the defense,[25] to the extent exculpatory information comes to the prosecution's attention through liaisons with the TRC, there would be an obligation to disclose the information.   As to a liaison for the prosecution, a person could either be designated from the Office of the Prosecutor, or individuals from the Office of the Prosecutor could work through a liaison in the Registry.   D. Applications for disclosure where the prosecution or defense seek TRC information that is confidential or work-product should be made to the Special Court.   Where disclosure is sought of material the TRC has treated as confidential, a determination would have to be made whether (i) the information can only be obtained from the TRC and (ii) is essential for the conviction or acquittal of the accused. (See Part I.A above.)   We believe that the party seeking the disclosure, either the prosecution or defense, should make an application to the Special Court. While, in general, we prefer disclosure issues to be worked out informally, in the instance where a decision needs to be made whether disclosure of confidential TRC information is warranted, we believe the matter should be the subject of formal adjudication.   E. The TRC and Special Court will need to coordinate on witness protection.   If there is any sharing of information between the Special Court and TRC, meetings between the two institutions will be needed to ensure that sharing of information does not inadvertently result in a person failing to be covered by witness protection.   Especially where information is provided to the Special Court that was provided by a TRC witness who had requested confidential treatment, the witness should be informed promptly that his or her testimony is being provided to the Special Court. Steps may need to be taken to prevent public disclosure of the witness' identity, and to ascertain whether the witness wants to participate in the Special Court's witness protection program. Careful consideration needs to go into deciding which body would be charged with locating the witness and advising the witness that his or her information is being provided to the Special Court and discussing potential protection options.[26]   F. The TRC and Special Court will need to coordinate on evidence gathering and forensic standards.   The TRC and Special Court will also need to coordinate their methodologies on evidence gathering. For example, to the extent the TRC investigates a particular site[27] or is provided with materials, it will be important to ensure that TRC investigators do not in any way disturb or taint evidence that the Special Court might need, or break a chain of custody that the Special Court might need to prove.    [1] Planning Mission Report, Annex to U.N. Doc. S/2002/246, at ¶¶ 49, 53 (Mar. 8, 2002).   [2] The TRC was established by Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act 2000 (Feb. 2000) (the """"TRC Act"""").   [3] Specifically, section 7(3) of the TRC Act provides: """"At the discretion of the Commission, any person shall be permitted to provide information to the Commission on a confidential basis and the Commission shall not be compelled to disclose any information given to it in confidence.""""   [4] Planning Mission Report, ¶ 55.   [5] See n. 24 infra.   [6] Because the Special Court has primacy over Sierra Leonean courts, they seem an inappropriate venue to adjudicate obligations of the Special Court.   [7] See TRC Act, Art. 7(3) (providing that, """"[a]t the discretion of the Commission,"""" persons may """"provide information to the Commission on a confidential basis""""); Art. 7(1)(b) (permitting the TRC to hold testimony sessions """"some of which may be public"""").   [8] Planning Mission Report, ¶ 55. Disclosure in such circumstances would not violate section 7(3) of the TRC Act, which makes any grant of confidential treatment left to the """"discretion of the Commission."""" The TRC might consider setting guidelines as to when """"confidential"""" treatment is appropriate. In order both to promote full and truthful disclosure to the TRC and lessen any burden upon the Special Court-i.e., to ensure that information is not unnecessarily treated as confidential-the TRC should grant confidential treatment only where there is legitimate need for it.   [9] Another option would be to ask a witness who does not want his or her name publicly revealed if he or she would be willing to have information provided to the TRC available to the Special Court if a pseudonym were used. If the witness agreed, a modified procedure might be used whereby the information (with the witness identified by pseudonym) could be freely available to the Special Court, and only if the Special Court wanted to know the witness' identity would the Special Court prosecutors or defense need to prove that the two above criteria were met.   [10] In order to encourage perpetrators to testify despite the fact that confidentiality could not be guaranteed, it might be useful to offer reduced sentences (and make it publicly known that reduced sentences will be granted) to perpetrators who come before the TRC, testify truthfully, and subsequently are prosecuted by the Special Court. Given the limited number of people who will be prosecuted by the Special Court, this practice might not result in any, or very few, sentence reductions, but might increase perpetrator participation in the TRC.   [11] While we use the term """"Special Court,"""" it will actually be investigators, prosecutors or defense counsel who seek the information. Mechanisms to allow them to obtain the information are discussed in Part III.   [12] This proposal would not need to be implemented in an agreement between the TRC and Special Court since under the Implementing Law the Special Court could presumably require the TRC to provide such statements.   [13] ICTR Rule 90(A) suggests that witness testimony should primarily occur in court, although, in certain circumstances, deposition testimony may be used. See ICTR Rule 90(A) (""""Witnesses shall, in principle, be heard directly by the Chambers unless a Chamber has ordered that the witness be heard by means of a deposition as provided for in Rule 71.""""). Rule 89(C), however, arguably is broad enough to allow admission of statements made out of court. See ICTR Rule 89(C) (""""""""A Chamber may admit any relevant evidence which it deems to have probative value.""""). The ICTR's Rules of Procedure and Evidence will be used by the Special Court. See Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone, Art. 14.   [14] Again, this proposal would not need an agreement between the institutions.   [15] The TRC will have the power to gather """"any information it considers relevant"""" including """"reports, record, documents or any information from any source,"""" and to visit premises for the purpose of """"taking copies of any documents which may be of assistance to the Commission."""" TRC Act, § 8(1)(a)-(b). See also § 8(1)(G) (empowering the TRC to issue subpoenas).    [16] Again, this proposal needs no agreement to implement since under the Implementing Law the Special Court could order the TRC to provide such documents.   [17] This topic would need to be addressed in an agreement between the institutions since the Implementing Law suggests that the Special Court could order the TRC to produce even work-product. There should be no need for the Special Court to obtain work-product of the TRC since the Special Court should primarily be concerned with obtaining evidentiary material, not mental impressions. To the extent underlying facts are contained in any """"work-product,"""" perhaps the document could be """"redacted"""" to remove mental impressions and legal theories so that factual material that the TRC has treated as non-confidential could be available to the Special Court, and factual material that the TRC has treated as confidential could be obtained if the two-part test set forth in Part I.A were met.   [18] This concept already exists in ICTR Rule 66(C), which allows the prosecutor, upon grant of an application by the Special Court, not to disclose to the defense information """"which may prejudice further or ongoing investigations, or for any other reasons may be contrary to the public interest or affect the security interests of any State.""""    [19] See ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Rule 70 (A) (""""reports, memoranda, or other internal documents prepared by a party, its assistants or representatives in connection with the investigation or preparation of the case, are not subject to disclosure . . . ."""").   [20] This assumes that the agreement discussed in Part I.A for treating information as """"confidential"""" has been implemented so that in most circumstances """"confidential"""" TRC information remains confidential.   [21] See ICTR Rule 70 (A) (protecting work product); Rule 97 (protecting lawyer-client privilege).   [22] The Planning Mission Report does not discuss the mechanics of information sharing.   [23] The recent Implementing Law makes it clear that the TRC would have to comply with Special Court orders, which would include orders to provide information. See Implementing Law, § 21(2).   [24] The TRC Act provides that the Commission has power """"to issue summonses and subpoenas."""" TRC Act, § 8(1)(g). That provision, if applied to the Special Court, appears to conflict with the Implementing Law and provisions of the Relationship Agreement Between The United Nations and The Government of Sierra Leone (""""Relationship Agreement""""), which both provide for the inviolability of Special Court premises.  See Implementing Law, § 7(1)-7(4); Relationship Agreement, Art. 8.   [25] ICTR Rule 68 requires disclosure of evidence that is known to the Prosecutor and """"which in any way tends to suggest the innocence or mitigate the guilt of the accused or may affect the credibility of prosecution evidence."""" See also ICTR Rule 66-67 (mandatory information disclosure).   [26] If reasonable efforts to locate the witness are unsuccessful, a presumption should apply that the Special Court will accord some form of protected or confidential treatment regarding information previously treated as confidential by the TRC. See ICTR Rules 68, 75 (allowing various measures to protect victims and witnesses); ICTR Rule 70(B) (allowing the prosecutor to use """"confidential"""" information to generate new evidence without disclosure to the defense). That presumption should also apply while efforts are made to locate a witness and, if a witness is located, until any request for protected treatment is ruled upon and implemented by the Special Court.   [27] Although it is anticipated that the TRC will primarily hear testimony, it also has the power to conduct investigations. See TRC Act, § 7(1)(a).","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned suicide attacks against civilians, which are absolutely prohibited under international humanitarian law. But such attacks cannot be used to excuse the serious violations committed by the IDF. """"There is no justification for the abuses documented in this report,"""" Megally said. """"The government of Israel should live up to its obligations and stop these acts immediately."""" He added that Human Rights Watch had failed, despite numerous requests, to arrange a meeting with IDF officials to discuss its research and findings. In addition to the systematic coercion of civilians, the report also documents other serious violations during the IDF raids, including acts of physical ill treatment of civilians, excessive damage to civilian properties, and collective punishments in the form of house demolitions. It also documents one case of hostage-taking, in which soldiers held and deliberately shot an unarmed civilian in the leg to force his brother, a """"wanted"""" Palestinian, to surrender. The taking of hostages is a war crime, and is absolutely prohibited under international law. The report also documents two cases in which armed Palestinians recklessly endangered Palestinian civilians by firing at IDF soldiers from locations that exposed the civilians to IDF return fire.

The Valencia meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is expected to be dominated by discussion of the campaign against terrorism and the Middle East crisis. Regarding the Israel-Palestinian Authority conflict, Human Rights Watch has condemned the pervasive disregard for civilian lives by all parties and repeatedly called on the international community to secure the urgent deployment of independent and impartial international monitors to report on serious and systematic violations of international humanitarian law. (See links below.)  At the same time, in a letter sent to all twenty-seven foreign ministers, Human Rights Watch urged the leaders to address the plight of migrants in Europe.  """"Urgent measures to curb the loss of civilian life in the Middle East conflict should certainly top the agenda,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But the Euro-Med Partners have committed to uphold human rights throughout the region, including in Western Europe, where the exclusion, discrimination, and abuse suffered by migrants are persistent problems. Partner states have a common interest in these issues and should make these meetings a forum for addressing them.""""  The Human Rights Watch letter details a range of abuses suffered by migrants and asylum seekers, including arbitrary detention; substandard conditions of detention; procedural violations in criminal and administrative law proceedings, and in the asylum system; racial and ethnic discrimination; police abuse; arbitrary and collective expulsions; violations of children's and women's rights; and horrendous abuses of migrants and asylum seekers at the hands of human traffickers, often in complicity with immigration and law enforcement officials in E.U. member or accession states. The letter notes that while many states have justified ever more restrictive approaches to immigration management in light of the September 11 attacks in the United States, many restrictive policies and abusive practices were either already in use or proposed for use before the attacks.  """"Governments have a right to control immigration and to guarantee national security, but immigration management is about more than law enforcement,"""" said Andersen. """"It also has to reflect the fundamental rights of migrants, no matter what their legal status.""""

Human Rights Watch wrote to FARC-EP leader, Manuel Marulanda, documenting the recent escalation in political kidnappings and calling for an immediate end to targeting political leaders.  On April 11, 2002, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) kidnapped thirteen lawmakers from a state legislature building in Cali, Valle. Disguised in military uniforms, the rebels ordered the assemblymen to evacuate because of an alleged bomb threat, and took them hostage. The Colombian authorities later rescued one of the legislators and several legislative aides. Rebels reportedly killed one police officer.  “The shocking kidnapping of the lawmakers in Cali is yet another example of the FARC-EP’s persistent, systematic violation of international humanitarian law,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “The recent escalation in political kidnappings demonstrates that the FARC-EP is not only continuing to target primarily civilians in this conflict, but shows a reprehensible disregard for the free political process in Colombia.”  In a six-page letter to Manuel Marulanda, the FARC-EP’s commander-in-chief, Human Rights Watch documented the escalation in kidnappings of political figures by the FARC-EP in the months leading up to the Colombian congressional elections of March 10, 2002, and the presidential elections of May 26, 2002.  In addition to the twelve lawmakers taken hostage on April 11, 2002, the FARC-EP currently holds in captivity the presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, the former governor of Meta, Alan Jara Urzola, and five legislators, including Senator Jorge Eduardo Gechem Turbay, Congresswoman Consuelo González de Perdomo, Congressman Orlando Beltrán Cuellar, Senator Luis Eladio Pérez Bonilla, and Congressman Oscar Tulio Lizcano. Human Rights Watch expressed grave concern for the safety of all of the hostages. Formally established in 1964, the FARC-EP is Colombia’s oldest and largest rebel group. Although estimates differ, the FARC-EP is believed to have over 15,000 members and is active throughout Colombia. Marulanda was one of its original founders and now presides over the General Secretariat, the group’s governing body. “As the most senior commander of the FARC-EP, Manuel Marulanda is responsible for the persistent human rights abuses committed by his forces,” said Vivanco. “He bears the responsibility for ensuring that FARC-EP forces abide by international legal norms, and that is why we are addressing him directly.” Human Rights Watch previously wrote to Commander Marulanda on July 10, 2001, urging him to stop his forces from committing a wide range of human rights abuses, including hostage-taking. Since then, however, the FARC-EP has continued to take civilian hostages in blatant violation of international humanitarian law.","Americas, Colombia",""

It gave the Georgian government an extraordinary twelve-month deadline to report back on measures taken to curb these abuses.  The Committee has provided clear instructions on what Georgia must do to fulfil its international human rights obligations,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The government must now move swiftly to reform Georgia's police, prisons, and criminal procedure code."""" The United Nations Human Rights Committee, a body of eighteen independent experts, monitors compliance of all countries party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with the covenant's provisions.  During its review of Georgia, on March 18-19, the Committee also expressed """"deep concern"""" about Georgia's rising intolerance against religious minorities, particularly Jehovah's Witnesses. Mob attacks by Georgian orthodox militants against religious minorities have escalated throughout the past two and a half years, facilitated by government inaction. The Committee called upon the Georgian government to ensure that those perpetrating abuses against religious minorities are prosecuted, to conduct a public awareness campaign on religious tolerance, and prevent, through education, intolerance and discrimination based on religion or beliefs.  The Committee's specific recommendations for curbing torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment or treatment by law enforcement officials and prison officers were as follows:  ·""""[E]nsure that all forms of torture and similar ill-treatment are punishable as serious crimes under its legislation""""; ·""""[S]et up an effective system to monitor the treatment of all prisoners"""" to ensure better protection of their personal safety;  ·""""[E]nsure that all complaints of ill-treatment are properly investigated by an independent authority, that those responsible are brought to justice and that victims are appropriately compensated"""";  ·""""Immediately upon first being deprived of liberty and during all stages of detention, free access to a lawyer and to doctors should be ensured"""";  ·Ensure """"[A]ll statements obtained by force from detained persons are investigated and may never be used as evidence, except as evidence of torture"""";  ·""""[P]rovide training in human rights particularly on the prohibition of torture, to police and prison officers"""";  Human Rights Watch has extensively documented widespread torture, mistreatment, and procedural violations by Georgian law enforcement officials in recent years. Methods of torture include sustained beating and the use of electric shocks. New figures from the Georgian Ministry of Justice indicate that police mistreatment and torture have not abated in recent months. In January and February alone, forty-four detainees transferred into pre-trial detention centers from police stations bore fresh injuries. The Georgian parliament's adoption in May and July 1999 of numerous regressive amendments to the 1998 criminal procedure code stripped away human rights protections for detainees, such as the right to file complaints with the courts about abuse or torture during pre-trial detention. Human Rights Watch's concern over these amendments prompted the publication in October 2000 of its report: """"Backtracking on Reform: Amendments Undermine Access to Justice.""""  The Committee expressed particular concern that the criminal procedure code permits detainees to be held by the police for up to seventy-two hours before being informed of the charges against them and a court orders their pre-trial detention. However, Georgian Ministry of Justice figures for 2001 show that, for the Tbilisi pre-trial detention center alone, 493 detainees were brought in from police stations in violation of the seventy-two hour deadline.  BACKGROUND NOTE ON GEORGIA'S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM  Georgia's police, procuracy, and system of state provision of defense lawyers remain largely unreformed since the time of the Soviet Union, and elements within these structures are reported to have lobbied parliament to secure the regressive criminal procedure code amendments of mid-1999. Reform of the judiciary has begun with the assistance of a World Bank project, yet several observers have questioned the sustainability of a reformed judiciary without reform of law enforcement institutions. Low and unreliably paid salaries, combined with the broad powers enjoyed by the police and procuracy, create significant incentives for law enforcement officials to abuse their position. An assessment of the state of the rule of law in Georgia prepared in April 2000 for USAID concluded that: """"Administration of justice is often conducted by a network of self-interested public officials concerned with neither the defendant nor the victim."""" In December 2001 President Shevardnadze established a commission to design a program of reform of the law enforcement bodies.","Europe/Central Asia, Georgia",""

Human Rights Watch said that the law, which was adopted in Belgrade yesterday, means little without the actual transfer of indictees and of documents sought by the tribunal. The law contains ambiguities and loopholes that could be manipulated to obstruct cooperation further, Human Rights Watch said.     """"No one should be duped by this law,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The true test for Yugoslavia is the transfer of war crime indictees."""" Andersen noted that the Yugoslav government says some transfers of indictees will take place by the end of this month.     The Yugoslav law was adopted following strong signals from the United States and Europe that closer relations would require Belgrade to cooperate with The Hague tribunal. Human Rights Watch urged the international community to maintain pressure until there is concrete evidence of cooperation with the tribunal.     The European Union last week issued a report on its Stabilization and Association Process with Yugoslavia, in which the European Commission observed:     """"Cooperation with the [ICTY], FRY's international obligation, both as a UN Member State and as a signatory of the Dayton / Paris Agreements, remains insufficient . . . . At federal level, the necessary access to evidence (witnesses, documents, archives - particularly military) is denied on the pretext that no domestic legislation authorises it. Even if a law is necessary on procedural aspects of the cooperation UNSCR 1207 specifically states that no state may invoke provisions of domestic law, or the lack of any procedural law, as a justification for its failure to cooperate. Little progress has been made, despite announcements by the authorities, and the delays continue to damage the functioning and reputation of the federal state.""""     The Council of Europe has also indicated that cooperation with the ICTY is a pre-requisite for Yugoslav membership in the pan-European organization. Yugoslavia hopes to join the Council this year and a delegation of the Council's Parliamentary Assembly is in Belgrade this week to assess Belgrade's progress.     U.S. law required a cut-off in aid to Yugoslavia unless U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell certified that Belgrade was cooperating with the ICTY. The Secretary has not yet issued that certification, effectively freezing continued U.S. assistance.     """"A law on cooperation was never actually necessary,"""" Andersen said. """"It may create as many problems as it solves. There should be no U.S. certification, no enhancement of the E.U. Stabilization process, and no movement toward Council of Europe membership until Belgrade's true intentions are clear.""""     Human Rights Watch identified four main areas of concern in the new law:    Yugoslav officials have stated that the law applies only to the individuals against whom indictments have already been issued. Human Rights Watch said that such a limitation clearly contravenes Yugoslavia's obligations under the Statute of the Hague tribunal, which requires all U.N. member states to honor the ICTY's indictments, no matter when they are issued.      The law states that """"a request for cooperation or the realization of certain decisions by the International Criminal Tribunal shall be accepted if it is based on the provisions of the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence and on the evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal."""" Human Rights Watch expressed concern that Yugoslav courts might construe such provisions as empowering them to determine whether the Tribunal is acting within its own Statute and to assess the quality of the evidence, before authorizing a transfer.      Another provision in the law erects potential barriers to the Tribunal prosecutor's work in Serbia and Montenegro. The law requires that these activities conform to the rights of Yugoslav citizens, international standards, Yugoslav law, Yugoslav sovereignty and national security interests. Human Rights Watch warned against domestic authorities invoking these vague standards to impede the prosecutor's work.      The law states that the proceedings it regulates shall be expeditious. However, the law does not set out specific time limits for the investigating judge and police to act. This omission could seriously delay the transfer of indictees.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Montenegro","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch is a private, international organization that monitors human rights in over seventy countries worldwide and serves as an associate organization of the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network. Human Rights Watch has undertaken a multi-year project focusing on the human rights of migrants in Western Europe. The project involves conducting research in a number of West European countries, with an eye toward influencing European Union law and policy on the human rights of migrants in the region.   In light of the events of September 11, Human Rights Watch's research and advocacy throughout the world has increasingly focused on the challenges governments face in ensuring both security and respect for human rights. We have monitored closely the impact of new anti-terrorism laws, policies and practices on human rights in general, and in Western Europe, on migrants and refugees in particular. In this regard, Human Rights Watch has published commentaries on various regional anti-terrorism initiatives-under consideration at the European Union, the Council of Europe, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. In each case, we have urged member state governments to ensure that immigration management and security measures fully respect human rights, including those of migrants and asylum seekers.   In a February 13, 2002 European Commission Communication in preparation for your upcoming Euro-Mediterranean Partnership meeting, External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten set out a slate of proposals """"to address issues of freedom, justice and governance, to deepen the dialogue between cultures and to extend the partnership to its social dimension."""" These proposals included strengthening joint commitments and concrete actions on the promotion of human rights and democracy; enhancing cooperation with respect to the protection of legal migrants; and addressing the issue of illegal immigration in the Euro-Mediterranean region.   The European Commission Communication noted that, particularly in light of the events of September 11, the political and security dialogue among partners """"requires close cooperation on the cross-border dimension of issues such as the fight against organised crime, illegal migration and trafficking in human beings, the management of legal migration, [and] the treatment of migrant communities."""" (paragraph 3.2). The communication implicitly divided the migration issue into two parts: the treatment of legal migrants in the European Union and restricting access to the European Union for undocumented migrants, including combating the trafficking of human beings. The communication failed to recognize, however, that all migrants, regardless of their status, have fundamental human rights that are routinely violated by Euro-Mediterranean partner states. Moreover, the communication failed to acknowledge that, in accordance with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (Trafficking Protocol), supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, trafficked persons are victims of a grievous human rights violation and as such are entitled to special protections.   Human Rights Watch's migrants' rights research raises a host of issues of relevance to the Euro-Mediterranean partners regarding the promotion of human rights in the context of both regular and irregular migration. Our findings indicate that both documented and undocumented migrants in many European Union countries suffer a range of abuses at entry points; in detention; within criminal justice, administrative law, and asylum systems; and as a matter of racial or ethnic discrimination. In the Euro-Mediterranean region, our research in Spain and Greece has been particularly instructive with respect to the range and gravity of human rights violations experienced by migrants and asylum seekers attempting to gain access to Europe through these Mediterranean gateways.   We enclose for your review a set of documents that reflect our research findings thus far.   Migrants and Asylum Seekers The report on Spain, The Other Face of the Canary Islands: Rights Violations against Migrants and Asylum Seekers (February 2002), highlights the plight of North and sub-Saharan African migrants and asylum seekers detained in appalling conditions with a minimum of respect for procedural guarantees in the Canary Islands. They are housed in gravely substandard facilities in overcrowded conditions with little or no access to regular health care, fresh air or exercise. They have inadequate access to counsel and opportunities to appeal the legality of their detention. And they are routinely denied the right to seek asylum. Aspects of their plight are mirrored in Greece, where we documented extremely substandard conditions of detention for undocumented migrants in police detention facilities in Athens. The treatment of migrants in detention is a serious human rights problem throughout Western Europe, reflecting a broader trend toward a singularly one-dimensional focus on the law enforcement aspect of migration at the expense of migrants' human rights.   Human Rights Watch has engaged the Spanish government in a constructive dialogue about how to bring its treatment of migrants into compliance with its regional and international obligations. We have urged the Spanish government to address the plight of migrants in detention not only at home, but also at the E.U. level during its current presidency and beyond. We hope that the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership can also provide a forum for progress on this serious human rights problem.   Unaccompanied Migrant Children Violations of migrants' rights often have the most serious effect on the most vulnerable members of this population. Human Rights Watch recently completed an investigation of the treatment of unaccompanied migrant children who traveled from Morocco to the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, looking into reports of abuses by Spanish police; dangerous and unsanitary conditions in Spanish residential centers; arbitrary expulsions to Morocco; and ill-treatment of expelled children by Moroccan authorities. Human Rights Watch will release a report with its findings and recommendations to both the Spanish and Moroccan governments in May 2002.   Trafficking in Human Beings Our research in Greece highlighted the plight of another population too often neglected in the migration debate: victims of trafficking in human beings. Human Rights Watch found that migrant women trafficked to Greece for forced prostitution faced and continue to face imprisonment, a complete lack of opportunity for legal redress, and deportation. Their traffickers continue this lucrative trade with impunity, assisted by corrupt police officers and the absence of a Greek anti-trafficking law. Human Rights Watch has provided the Greek government with commentary on its 2001 immigration bill and is working to ensure that a proposed anti-trafficking bill contains human rights protections for victims and adequate accountability mechanisms for traffickers and their accomplices.   As the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership moves forward, we hope that it will also press for human rights protections for trafficking victims, accountability for traffickers, and ratification and implementation by all partners of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. We also urge partnership members to ensure that human rights protections for trafficking victims, including adequate witness protection mechanisms, are included in all regional agreements, such as E.U. council framework decisions relating to trafficking.   Euro-Mediterranean Partnership: Next Steps African and Middle Eastern Euro-Mediterranean partners have a stake in these issues, as many of the migrants suffering rights violations in Western Europe are their nationals. European partner countries also have an interest in the human rights dimension of migration. In particular, the need for migrant labor in Western Europe is growing and the necessity of adopting immigration policies that reflect fair labor standards is pressing. For all the partnership states, an essential aspect of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is the strengthening of democracy and respect for human rights throughout the region, reflecting their recognition that regional stability would be enhanced through a common agreement to act in accordance with the United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as well as other obligations under international law, in particular those arising out of regional and international instruments to which they are party (Barcelona Declaration, November 1995). Reaping the benefit of these common commitments of course requires that all member states strive to uphold all relevant human rights standards, including the fundamental rights of migrants, regardless of their status.   Human Rights Watch hopes that this information is useful to the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and will spur a dialogue among the partners and with human rights organizations, refugee and migrants' groups, and women's and children's rights groups leading to a renewed commitment to upholding the rights of migrants and asylum seekers and a program of concrete action to achieve that goal. The recommendations in our reports are targeted to national governments and regional and international intergovernmental bodies in the hope that our findings can be translated into such concrete action that ensures that migrants enjoy the rights to which they are entitled under regional and international law.   Human Rights Watch looks forward to a continuing exchange of information and dialogue on these issues as the Barcelona Process moves forward.

Yet on Thursday morning there was just such a moment: The treaty for the International Criminal Court received the ratification it needs to go into effect. At a dignified ceremony at the United Nations in New York, representatives of several small countries filed papers certifying that their governments have ratified the treaty. That lifted the number of nations that have done so to more than 60, the number necessary for this important new international institution to begin operations. This is a remarkable achievement: the most important human rights institution created in the last half century. To reach this point, the treaty has needed two levels of approval. The first came at a 1998 meeting of governmental representatives in Rome when 120 nations signed the document, a number that ultimately grew to 139. That started the second approval process in which representatives of the governments of at least 60 additional nations also had to formally ratify it. The United States did not sign the treaty at the Rome meeting, largely on the grounds that U.S. soldiers or civilians could be subjected to politically motivated prosecutions. But President Clinton, in the last days of his administration--and despite calling the treaty flawed--decided to sign on. It was a reasonable move, if only because it allowed the U.S. to remain engaged in shaping this new institution. Even though it has signed, the U.S. is not expected to ratify the treaty any time soon. The assumption had been that Washington would wait to see how the court operates before moving forward. But now it appears that President Bush is considering the unprecedented step of revoking the U.S. signature on the treaty. That would put the U.S. sharply at odds with its closest allies. Britain, France, Germany, and Canada have all ratified the treaty and are urging the U.S. to do the same. At a time when Washington is asking for law enforcement cooperation against terrorism, it hardly seems the moment to undermine an historic new law institution to deal with crimes that are every bit as heinous. The court's concept is simple. It establishes a permanent tribunal to prosecute individuals--not nations--accused of genocide, war crimes, and of crimes against humanity. The idea for such a court reaches back to the early days of the 20th Century. It gained special urgency as the century concluded against the backdrop of massacres in Rwanda, Cambodia and the Balkans. On the one hand, it is hard to imagine taking a position against an institution that could help prosecute future Pol Pots and Saddam Husseins. But that is precisely what appears to be happening when the U.S. stands alongside Libya as the only two nations speaking out against the court. Largely with American concerns in mind, the court has been designed to prevent its being used for unfair prosecutions. For example, the International Criminal Court will step in only if a nation fails to carry out investigations and--if appropriate--prosecutions, of crimes that fall under the court's jurisdiction. Good-faith efforts to discover the truth and hold accountable those who are accused will prevent the court from intervening. When individuals are brought before the court they will receive the highest standards of due process and fair trial guarantees, including the right to counsel, the right to remain silent, the presumption of innocence, and the right to multiple appeals. These safeguards, of course, still depend on the quality and expertise of the people who are applying them. That is why it is so important for the U.S. to stay engaged with the court. Even as a nation that has not ratified the treaty, the U.S. can exert influence over selection of prosecutors and judges and, equally important, the creation of the court's culture. The positive influence of the U.S. in setting up the tribunals dealing with allegations of war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda was significant. The same could hold true for the International Criminal Court--but only if the U.S. participates. The International Criminal Court will begin to function with or without U.S. participation, but it will have much greater weight if the most powerful nation on earth stays engaged. It would be a mistake for President Bush to isolate the U.S. by removing its signature from the treaty. Many nations of the world have worked hard to bring themselves to this moment of celebration. By staying involved in the International Criminal Court, even if only by leaving this nation's signature on the treaty, the U.S. will stay on the right side of history.","United States",""

At United Nations headquarters in New York, governments supporting the rule of law welcomed the establishment of the first permanent international tribunal to try those accused of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The ICC was created because national court systems -- from Guatemala to Sierra Leone to Iraq -- have failed to provide justice to the victims of egregious crimes. The Court will take cases only when the national systems do not work.  """"The International Criminal Court is potentially the most important human rights institution created in 50 years. It will be the court where the Saddams, Pol Pots and Pinochets of the future are held to account,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. The Court will have authority to prosecute the most serious international crimes that are committed after July 1, 2002. The treaty contains numerous safeguards to screen out any politically motivated cases. In addition, the Court will apply the highest procedural protections in international law to the accused. These ensure respect for fair trials.  The 60th ratification has come after less than four years, sooner than even the Court's staunchest advocates expected. Diplomats had previously predicted that it would take eight to ten years to obtain the 60 ratifications.  """"The ICC treaty's early entry into force reinforces the new trend started by the Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the Pinochet litigation. The ICC will be the cornerstone of the emerging system of international justice,"""" Dicker said. The U.S. Government opposes the Court. The Bush administration's hostility comes in the face of strong support for the Court from nearly all of its closest international allies.

Human Rights Watch said that none of those responsible for the abuses at the end of January 2001, including shootings of demonstrators, beatings and sexual abuse, had yet been held to account. Not until a year after these shocking events did the Tanzanian government appoint a commission of inquiry,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “We welcome that decision, but urge the commission to move quickly to gather the evidence necessary to bring those responsible to justice. We hope that our report will help them get to the truth.” The report, “'The Bullets Were Raining’ – The January 2001 Attack on Peaceful Demonstrators in Zanzibar,” details massacres that took place at four main locations – in Zanzibar Town, and at Wete, Micheweni, and Chake Chake on Pemba Island. Human Rights Watch concludes that upper-level government and security officials planned the crackdown in advance. Human Rights Watch said the Tanzanian army and police opened fire without due cause on January 27, 2001, attacking thousands of supporters of the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) who were protesting against alleged fraud in national elections held three months earlier. In the following days, the security forces, aided by ruling party officials and militias, went on a house-to-house rampage, indiscriminately arresting, beating, and sexually abusing island residents. Some two thousand Zanzibaris fled to nearby Kenya, though most have now returned following an agreement between the government and the CUF. “These events were among the worst in a long history of differences between the mainland government and political opposition in the semi-autonomous Zanzibar islands,” said Takirambudde. “The Tanzanian security forces were willing to shoot, beat, torture, and commit sexual abuse to silence the political opposition.”  No one was reprimanded for a role in the killings, torture, or destruction of property. Instead, Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa publicly congratulated the security forces for restoring order on the islands, and several security forces officers were subsequently promoted.  The government-appointed commission of inquiry was set up in January 2002 following an agreement last October between Tanzania’s ruling Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party and the CUF, and is due to announce its findings by July. The October agreement also commits the government to introduce various constitutional reforms.","Africa, Tanzania",""

The deadline passed today for delegations to file resolutions that condemn a particular country for human rights abuse.  """"The absence of a China resolution is a diplomatic fiasco,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"China's human rights record couldn't be clearer, and members of the Commission should be very embarrassed.""""  This is only the second time since 1990 that a China resolution has not been tabled in Geneva by either the European Union or the United States. In 1995, a China resolution came within one vote of being adopted, and since then, the Chinese government has lobbied vigorously to keep any resolutions off the agenda.  Neither the U.S. nor the EU appeared to put a high priority on getting China on the agenda of the Commission this year. Human Rights Watch was particularly critical of the European Union and its member states for today's debacle. On March 11, 2002, the EU foreign ministers met in Brussels and expressed concern about the """"lack of respect for human rights in China, including the freedoms of expression, religion and association."""" The EU declined to sponsor a China resolution, but did leave open the possibility of an individual EU member sponsoring a measure. However, no EU country stepped forward. The Bush administration expressed interest in supporting a resolution if one were tabled, but without a seat on the Commission this year, the U.S. could not be an original sponsor.  In April 2001, a China resolution sponsored by the U.S. was blocked by a """"no action"""" procedural motion by China. That motion was adopted: twenty-three yes, seventeen no, 12 abstentions, and one absent. Human Rights Watch has documented increasing human rights violations in China over the past year, fuelled by Beijing's preoccupation with stability in the face of social and economic upheaval. China launched a massive anti-crime campaign last April, leading to thousands of arbitrary arrests and summary executions; new restrictions on the Internet have been imposed; efforts to organize independent trade unions have been crushed; and officials have carried out an intense crackdown on Falun Gong and unofficial religious groups of all kinds.","Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"

Five women have told Human Rights Watch researchers about incidents of sexual violence they endured earlier this year. Three of the women tried to report the assaults to local authorities who refused to investigate the allegations.  During so-called """"sweep"""" operations, when Russian forces conduct house-to-house searches for those believed to be involved in Chechen rebel activity, male relatives often leave their villages for safer locations to reduce the risk of arbitrary arrest, torture, and """"disappearances."""" However, without men in the house, women become more vulnerable to soldiers intent on sexual assault.  The social and cultural barriers to reporting sexual violence are high in Chechnya.  """"The Russian government is telling the world that life is returning to normal in Chechnya,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But it hasn't brought anyone to justice for these terrible crimes of sexual violence.""""  Andersen urged the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, now meeting in Geneva, to adopt a resolution condemning Russian abuses in Chechnya. In the past two years, the Commission has adopted strongly worded resolutions on the Chechnya conflict, condemning violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, and calling on Russia to establish a national commission of inquiry and bring abusers to justice. The Russian government has rejected both resolutions.  """"Aset Asimova"""" (not the woman's real name), a 43-year-old widow, told Human Rights Watch that she was at home with her eight-year-old son when drunken soldiers came in early February. Three of them took her into a separate room while others looted the house. """"They tore my dress. They asked me where the men were, they asked me how long I had been without a husband."""" The soldiers then told her to undress, and when she fought them off they beat her with the butts of their rifles, and raped her. """"I don't know how many of them raped me. I lost consciousness, when it was happening. When I came to, they were pouring water on me … then they left.""""  """"Asimova"""" did not report the rape to authorities. Human Rights Watch researchers have found that many women are reluctant to report crimes of sexual assault, fearing stigma and retaliation. """"Asimova's"""" first action after the soldiers left was to hide what had happened, so her grown son would not learn of the rape. """"I smeared the blood on my nose and mouth, as if I had been beaten there and that was the reason for it. I cleaned everything, and hid my dress and put on a clean one.""""  Other women tried to report sexual assaults and found their efforts thwarted by local authorities. During a January 29 sweep operation, soldiers sexually assaulted """"Madina Magomedova"""" (not her real name) and her sisters in their parents' home. Soldiers had come to """"Magomedova's"""" house earlier in the day, and she suspected they returned because they knew that there were no men there.  """"They wanted to touch me, they said I had pretty lips and that they would kiss me,"""" she told Human Rights Watch. """"I knew what they wanted to do and started to resist.

""""Magomedova"""" told Human Rights Watch that she had not been raped, but that the soldiers beat her badly while she struggled against them; she needed three days of bedrest to recover.  Soldiers threatened """"Magomedova's"""" sisters in her presence, and also tried to coerce one of them to perform oral sex. """"They wanted to arrest my older sister, because she only has a temporary registration certificate, not an internal passport.

""""Magomedova"""" filed a criminal case with the prosecutor's office for sexual assault despite warnings from the soldiers against it and a local prosecutor who discouraged her from going forward with the case. Fearing retribution, she eventually fled to a different town.  In another case, two sisters detained in early March suffered sexual assault while in custody. Relatives convinced the two women to come forward to report their ill-treatment to state authorities. """"Luiza Larsanova"""" (not the woman's real name), a 27-year-old woman, was detained on March 4, 2002 and held in two locations before being released the same evening.

But in the second place, they said they would rape me. That was worse. I was sitting on a chair, and one of them grabbed me from behind, and started to caress me, as if to calm me but really it was terrifying, saying 'oh you're so sweet, so tiny.' I was wearing woolen long underwear under my skirt, and he told me to take them and my skirt off. I was crying, and said I had nothing to tell them and to leave me alone, I was practically on my knees, begging him not to touch me.""""  """"Larsanova"""" told Human Rights Watch that although the soldiers groped her breasts and fondled her, they did not rape her.  """"Larsanova's"""" 21-year-old sister """"Tsatsita Timurova"""" (not her real name), detained the previous day, also told Human Rights Watch that while detained she was beaten, groped, and threatened, but not raped.

In January 2002, Human Rights Watch provided a memorandum documenting other cases of rape and sexual assault in Chechnya to the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). In a public statement, the Committee raised serious concerns about the Russian Federation's failure to conduct proper investigations or hold perpetrators accountable in the vast majority of cases in the face of strong evidence that members of the Russian forces committed acts of rape and other sexual violence against women during the armed conflict in Chechnya. Human Rights Watch also sent letters supporting the U.N.

The displacement and insecurity could undermine the loya jirga process, which begins at the district level on April 13 and will lead in June to the selection of a new government for a two-year transitional period. If northern Pashtuns are unable to take part in district or regional meetings to choose their representatives, then the validity of the entire loya jirga process will be called into question,"""" said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher for emergencies. """"The international community must act now to guarantee the security of northern Pashtuns and other local minorities across Afghanistan as the loya jirga process begins."""" The 56-page report, Paying for the Taliban's Crimes: Abuses Against Ethnic Pashtuns in Northern Afghanistan, documents cases of summary executions, beatings, sexual violence, abductions, and looting that have been committed since November 2001, when non-Pashtun Northern Alliance forces regained power in the north. The report's findings, gathered during four weeks of interviews with villagers, community leaders, and international observers in northern Afghanistan, include the following: · Hazara gunmen killed 37 Pashtun men in the village of Bargah-e Afghani, in Chimtal district of Balkh province, in early December, after tying most of them up, beating them in front of their families, and demanding money to spare their lives; · Two Pashtun men arrested by Uzbek soldiers in the Aibak market in Samangan province in late December were held for a week in a basement and beaten with cables until they agreed to pay money; and · A Pashtun farmer in Nahrin district of Baghlan province was beaten for half an hour on February 20 in front of a Tajik commander who was demanding money from him. His wife, who tried to intercede, was kicked hard. Despite cultural barriers to reporting sexual violence in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch was able to gather testimony from several rape survivors and witnesses. In one case from Balkh city in late December, a Pashtun woman recounted how she and her fourteen-year-old daughter were gang-raped by Hazara soldiers. All three of the major armed factions in the north-the mainly Uzbek Junbish-i Milli-yi Islami, the mainly Tajik Jamiat-e Islami, and the Hazara Hizb-i Wahdat-are implicated in the violence against ethnic Pashtuns. Armed villagers from non-Pashtun communities have also looted and attacked Pashtuns with impunity in areas controlled by one or another of these parties. The attacks are being carried out partly in reprisal for perceived support given to the Taliban in northern Afghanistan by local Pashtuns. The Taliban was dominated by Pashtuns from Kandahar and other southern provinces, and its forces were implicated in massacres, destruction of homes, and other serious abuses against non-Pashtun communities in the north between 1997 and 2001. A three-person team appointed in February by Hamid Karzai, the chairman of Afghanistan's interim government, to investigate abuses against northern Pashtuns had findings similar to those of Human Rights Watch. In its report, Human Rights Watch welcomed the appointment but said that Chairman Karzai's capacity to implement the team's recommendations is limited. Key power in the north remains in the hands of regional warlords and local commanders, some of whom hold high office in the interim government and provincial administrations. """"The United States and its partners in the coalition against terrorism cannot abandon Afghanistan to parties that continue to commit human rights abuses,"""" Bouckaert said. """"It's only through the presence of an expanded international security force that Afghan citizens will have an opportunity to choose an accountable government and allow national institutions a chance to rebuild."""" The Human Rights Watch report called on the international community to take the following steps: · Support the expansion of the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan, which currently is limited to Kabul; · Support the timely creation of a diverse and human rights-trained Afghan national army and exclude from it commanders and troops responsible for war crimes or serious human rights violations; · Support efforts to establish accountability for past and current abuses committed in Afghanistan; · Increase funding for human rights monitoring, including through the Afghan Human Rights Commission that is to be established under the Bonn agreement; and · Ensure humanitarian assistance reaches northern Pashtuns and other minorities displaced by ethnically-targeted violence","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Stop the deliberate targeting of civilians and other persons protected by international humanitarian law. Stop actions that harm them. Immediately deploy international monitors to protect the human rights of Palestinians and Israelis. As a fully-fledged State and as an Occupying Power, Israel has clear obligations under international law, and in particular under the Fourth Geneva Convention. This Convention provides for security measures that can be taken to protect itself, but these do not include the excesses now undertaken by the Israeli government. We strongly deplore actions by the state of Israel that harm persons protected by international humanitarian law. These include prolonged curfews with severe restrictions on the movement of people and access for medical personnel; intensified collective punishments; wanton damage to homes, cars and civilian property; looting and theft in the course of searches; and the coerced use of civilians to assist military operations. Such actions violate international standards and transcend any justification of military necessity.  The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has recently declared whole areas, such as Ramallah and Bethlehem, closed military zones, and impeded the entrance of outside observers, including journalists, human rights activists, government officials, United Nations representatives, and the International Committee of the Red Cross. The IDF has forcibly entered and ransacked the offices of human rights organizations such as al Haq and LAW. Both Palestinian and Israeli organizations have shown great determination in continuing to work under these circumstances, but it has been almost impossible to verify alarming reports about extra judicial executions, """"liquidations"""" of """"wanted"""" Palestinians, and use of lethal force against civilians and other persons protected by the Geneva Conventions.  As a result of the IDF military operations, hundreds of Palestinians have been arrested. The identities and whereabouts of detainees are not known, and the ICRC has not been allowed access to them, raising concerns about their conditions and treatment. Several released Palestinians have reported that, depending on the IDF unit guarding them, prisoners were at times beaten.  In entire cities and towns, ambulances and emergency medical services have ground to a halt. Medical workers and ambulances have been fired upon. The wounded have been denied access to medical treatment; Palestinians have been killed attempting to reach hospitals for routine medical care. Such abuses raise not simply humanitarian issues: they are serious violations of international humanitarian law.  Even in the face of this situation, we are appalled by an increase in the use of suicide bombers by armed Palestinian groups to attack Israeli civilians. Such deliberate attacks on civilians are absolutely prohibited by international humanitarian law. These actions tarnish the Palestinian cause and will not at all help the situation -they only increase the fear and mistrust of ordinary Israelis as well as adding to the suffering in the region. Over the past week there have also been increasing signs of a breakdown in law and order within Palestinian territories as well, including the street-killing of alleged collaborators with Israel.  All these violations must be stopped by those in a position to do so and perpetrators must be brought to justice.  In the face of such a human rights crisis, it is time for the international community to act. Our three human rights organizations welcome the proposal by Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, that the UN Commission on Human Rights send an immediate mission to the area. We also repeat our call for international permanent presence to be dispatched to Israel and the Occupied territories to monitor the situation, restore respect for human rights and humanitarian law standards and to help protect civilians. The international community, and in particular the United States, should exert its utmost influence to ensure that both the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority cooperate with and facilitate the work of these missions. The presence of international monitors does not absolve the relevant parties from their human rights responsibilities or obligations. On the contrary it should help enhance them.  Ladies and Gentlemen, civilian suffering is not inevitable in a time of war or occupation. Ordinary people should never become the target of those with arms. All our organizations have witnessed, documented, and reported a wanton disregard for the right to life over the past eighteen months. Such abuse must stop now. Those who commit such crimes must cease them. And the international community is morally, and legally, obliged to act to ensure respect for such basic humanitarian principles.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

He was the second elected member of Syria's parliament in less than a month to get a five-year prison term for advocating democratic change.  Syria has effectively declared war on its peaceful political critics, said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “These sentences are clearly designed to punish and intimidate all advocates of democratic political change in Syria.”  On April 4, the Damascus criminal court found Seif guilty of attempting “to change the Syrian constitution by illegal means.” On March 20, the same court sentenced Mamoun al-Homsi, another outspoken member of parliament who had criticized the government of President Bashar al-Asad, to five years in prison on similar charges. Homsi was arrested in August 2001, al-Seif in September 2001.  Both parliamentarians had openly criticized of Syria's closed political system, dominated by the ruling Bath party, and advocated democratic reforms. Following the death of former president Hafez al-Asad in June 2000, Seif organized a freewheeling discussion group at his home until February 2001, when the government clamped down on these increasingly popular civic forums. Unable to obtain official permission for the continued operation of his group, Seif defiantly revived it in September 2001 and was promptly arrested. Following his arrest, seven other civic forum activists were also detained and remain in prison awaiting trial.  “This is the same pattern of repression of free expression that prevailed under former president Hafez al-Asad,” Megally said. “The new twist is using the civilian judiciary to deliver these deplorable verdicts.”  In the 1980s, Syria rounded up thousands of peaceful political activists and held them in long-term detention without charge or trial. In the 1990s, hundreds of political activists were prosecuted in the exceptional state security court, and typically sentenced to prison terms of five to ten years.  “The sentences imposed on Seif and Homsi do not augur well for the fate of the other activists,” Megally added. “Those cases have been referred to the state security court, and we fear their sentences could be even more severe.”  The procedures of the state security court -- whose decisions cannot be appealed -- do not comply with internationally recognized fair trial standards.  The eight other prisoners, all arrested in September 2001, include one of Syria's most prominent political opposition figures, Riad al-Turk, head of the unauthorized Communist Party-Political Bureau, who is in his seventies and was imprisoned without charge from 1980 to 1998.  Also awaiting trial before the state security court is economics professor Aref Dalila, a founding member of the Committees for the Revival of Civil Society. The other six detainees were active in civil forums and human rights groups: physician Walid al-Buni, lawyer Habib Issa (a participant in Homsi's and Seif's legal defense teams), physician Kamal Labouani, engineer Fawwaz Tello, Habib Saleh, and Hassan Saadoun.  Human Rights Watch called on the European Union and the United States to use diplomatic and other leverage to press for the immediate and unconditional release of the two parliamentarians and the eight still awaiting trial.  Syria is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression, association, and assembly.","Middle East/North Africa, Syria",""

The Saudi government warning came after its security forces reportedly dispersed a gathering in the northern town of Skaka, where some 150 Saudis protested Israeli military actions in the West Bank, and arrested dozens of demonstrators. The official Saudi Press Agency on April 4 quoted interior minister Prince Nayef bin Abd al-Aziz as saying: """"This behavior is not allowed and it must not happen again.” He added that demonstrations were “not compatible” with the kingdom’s social system.  “Peaceful assembly is a basic right,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The government should be promulgating laws to guarantee this right, not threaten harsh measures for those who try to demonstrate.”  In October 2001, Saudi authorities reportedly arrested several people who participated in a demonstration in Riyadh in support of Palestinians. In February 2002, Prince Nayef made clear that demonstrations would not be tolerated during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. “We will not permit…demonstrations or marches during the pilgrimage,” he said at a press conference on February 16. “We are totally and firmly ready to face any incident with wisdom, firmness, and force.” The government reportedly deployed 20,000 military and security forces personnel in and around the Holy City of Mecca.  Human Rights Watch recently interviewed Saudi citizens from across the political spectrum who strongly criticized the absence of basic rights in the kingdom, including the right of freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.  “The government’s refusal to open up the country’s political space leaves it terribly out of touch with its own citizens as well as in violation of basic international human rights standards,” said Megally. He noted that the kingdom is currently a member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, now holding its annual meeting in Geneva.  Saudi Arabia is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, one of the basic human rights treaties.

While Human Rights Watch welcomed Cambodia's decision to authorize the processing of Montagnards for resettlement to the United States, the organization said that Cambodia's decision to close its borders and summarily deport future asylum seekers was contrary to its obligations under international refugee law. On March 31, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that within a month the two refugee camps for Montagnard refugees in Cambodia operated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would be closed and all newcomers prevented from entering the country.  """"Like any government, Cambodia has an obligation under international law to keep its borders open to those fleeing persecution and to provide at least temporary protection and asylum,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch. """"Failure to do so could result in the return of refugees to a country where their lives and freedom are at risk -- a violation of the most fundamental principle of refugee protection, non-refoulement.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese government to immediately address the cause of the refugee flow and cease its repression of the indigenous Montagnards. Reilly further called on Vietnam to allow UNHCR to station monitors in the Central Highlands to check on refugees who have already returned to Vietnam, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and to monitor future refugee flows.  """"While Cambodia deserves credit for trying to find a solution for the Montagnards who are currently in the refugee camps in Cambodia, we have serious concerns about the future protection of Montagnard asylum seekers fleeing Vietnam,"""" said Reilly. """"And unless Vietnam addresses the cause of the refugee flows by ceasing human rights violations against the Montagnards, there will be no lasting solution to the refugee crisis.""""  Ongoing Repression In February 2001 the Vietnamese government launched a harsh crackdown on Montagnards in the Central Highlands after thousands joined largely peaceful protests for land rights, religious freedom, and independence. Recent reports received by Human Rights Watch indicate that ongoing human rights violations include repression of Evangelical Protestants, travel bans, forced oath-swearing ceremonies, police torture of suspected dissidents, and mistreatment of those who have attempted to flee to Cambodia.  During the past year more than 1,500 Montagnards fled to Cambodia, where many were sheltered in two camps operated by UNHCR in Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri provinces. Cambodia's decision to authorize processing of the Montagnard refugees for resettlement abroad followed the dissolution of a voluntary repatriation program agreed upon in January 2002 in a tripartite agreement by Cambodia, Vietnam and UNHCR.  On March 22, UNHCR announced that it was formally terminating its involvement with the repatriation process after Cambodian officials permitted Vietnam to send delegations of several hundred people to visit the camps to pressure the refugees to return to Vietnam. In one incident on March 21, refugees and UNHCR staff were threatened and roughed up when a delegation of more than 400 people, which included as many as one hundred Vietnamese government agents, overran the camp and conducted house-to-house searches of the refugees' huts.  On March 31, Cambodian authorities announced that they have increased the police and military presence along its border with Vietnam and that any Montagnards caught crossing the border will be considered illegal immigrants and immediately deported.","Asia, Cambodia, Vietnam","Religious Freedom, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

As things now stand, they won't be forced to defend China's treatment of labor organizers, or its crackdown on pro-democracy activists, Tibetans or Internet users. Nor will there be any debate on China's human rights record at the annual meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights now underway in Geneva -- unless the European Union, the U.S. and other key governments act quickly to push for a resolution on the issue. While Chinese workers risk going to jail or being beaten for exercising their rights, European governments seem unwilling to risk alienating Beijing's leaders. And the U.S., without a seat on the commission this year, may prefer to let China off the hook and let the Europeans take the blame. This leaves the door open for China to claim a huge diplomatic victory. Both European governments and the Bush administration clearly understand the scale and scope of China's human rights violations. The U.S. State Department's annual human rights survey, issued last month, documented China's widespread abuses. The report blasted Beijing for trying to """"legitimize measures against Muslim Uighur activists under the antiterrorism umbrella (leading to) an intensification of a crackdown in the Xinjiang autonomous region."""" On March 11, the EU's foreign ministers met in Brussels and expressed concern about the """"lack of respect for human rights in China, including the freedoms of expression, religion and association."""" They also criticized the denial of religious and cultural rights in Tibet and Xinjiang and warned that China's """"fight against terrorism should be pursued with full respect for human rights."""" But unless these strong words are backed up with equally strong action, China will have no incentive to take concrete steps to end these abuses. There is a way forward. Unlike previous years, when the EU insisted on acting as a whole, the 15 foreign ministers of the member states have left it open to individual EU members to sponsor a resolution on China. They also agreed to """"consider favorably"""" voting for such a resolution, if one is introduced. What is needed now is a clear decision by one European government to take the lead to introduce a resolution in time to build up support and gather other cosponsors. Even without a seat on the commission, the U.S. could lend its weight and diplomatic clout, as Sweden did in 2001. Though not a commission member last year, Sweden -- then holding the EU presidency -- worked tirelessly on behalf of various resolutions put forward by the EU in Geneva, including ones on difficult issues such as Iran and Chechnya. The diplomatic wrangling in Geneva matters because the mere threat of a debate on its human rights record gives China an incentive to take some positive steps in response. For example, in recent years China has signed two U.N. human rights treaties and ratified one of them; signed a technical cooperation agreement with the U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights and invited U.N. human rights experts to visit China and Tibet --although it has so far failed to implement their recommendations. The Geneva debate is especially important this year, since the political succession process is underway in China, leading to the Communist Party congress in the fall. China's successful integration into the World Trade Organization and the continuation of its economic reforms are in part dependent on the new leadership paying serious attention to the need for fundamental legal and judicial reform. Action at the U.N. forum is one way to signal the international community's interest in promoting such reforms. Beijing's preoccupation with stability in the face of continued social and economic upheaval is fueling an increase in human rights violations. China has taken steps to limit free expression by arresting academics, and closing newspapers and magazines. Last month, an article exposing corruption at a government-supported charity was killed under pressure from official censors. Authorities have also continued their intense crackdown on Falun Gong and unofficial religious groups of all kinds. Through the massive """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign launched last April, security forces have conducted thousands of arbitrary arrests and summary executions. Efforts to organize independent trade unions have been crushed and stringent new regulations on Internet use came into effect last year, imposing strict censorship on bulletin board services and chat rooms. There is still time to hold China to account for its international human rights obligations during this year's session of the commission -- but only if those governments anxious to court Beijing's support in the war against terror don't abandon their commitment to basic human rights principles.

Human Rights Watch also called on the government to protect Dominicans of Haitian descent from deportation, consistent with the constitution's rule of citizenship by birth.  Targeted because their skin color is often darker, """"Haitian-looking"""" people are frequently deported to Haiti within hours of their detention, causing families to be separated and children to be left behind. Suspected undocumented Haitians - including Dominicans of Haitian descent - have no fair opportunity to challenge their expulsion.  Acknowledging recent steps toward reform, Human Rights Watch commended the government of President Hipólito Mejía for showing an unprecedented willingness to bring its treatment of Haitians and Dominico-Haitians into compliance with international human rights standards.  """"The Dominican government needs to fully implement its own constitution and laws,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It would make real human rights progress if its practice conformed to its rules.""""  The 34-page report, """"'Illegal People': Haitians and Dominico-Haitians in the Dominican Republic,"""" is based on research conducted in 2001 and includes extensive testimony from Haitian and Dominico-Haitian deportees, families denied proof of citizenship, lawyers, government officials, and human rights advocates. Dominico-Haitians face great difficulties in proving their entitlement to remain in their own country, with the result that generations of ethnic Haitians are denied recognition as citizens, leaving them in what the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has described as """"permanent illegality.""""  The report describes the terrible impact of this denial of citizenship, particularly on the right of children to an education. Some children of Haitian descent have been barred from the classroom, particularly beyond the primary school level.  While recognizing the Dominican Republic's sovereign right to control immigration, Human Rights Watch called on the Dominican government to remedy its abusive practices. With this in mind, it commended the government's September 2001 decision to grant birth certificates to two Dominico-Haitian children whose citizenship had been in dispute.  """"This was a good first step, but thousands of other people face the same problem,"""" said Vivanco.  Human Rights Watch also hailed the government's agreement last week to establish a joint committee to monitor compliance with the rulings of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, a move announced after negotiations in a case involving Haitians and Dominico-Haitians currently pending in the Inter-American human rights system. Human Rights Watch expressed concern, however, about an apparent nationalist backlash against the creation of the body, including anti-Haitian graffiti that has appeared in recent days in the streets of Santo Domingo.  """"The government's recent initiatives in the Inter-American human rights system are extremely encouraging,"""" said Vivanco. """"Although the question of illegal immigration is a difficult one, I'm hopeful that the government will continue making progress toward handling it in a fair and non-discriminatory way.""""  Selected cases from the report:  Detained by Dominican immigration officials in February 2001, Lucía François was not allowed to collect her two youngest children, ages four and six, before being deported to Haiti. When Human Rights Watch interviewed her six months later, she had still not seen nor spoken to them. Unable to return to the Dominican Republic, where her children were born, and with no possibility of telephone contact, François was totally cut off from her two girls. """"I haven't been able to talk to anyone from home,"""" François told Human Rights Watch. """"I don't know if they're dead or alive . . . . Every day, when I wake up, I'm thinking about my kids.""""  By age twenty-three, Jorge Rene Méndez, a third-generation Dominican of Haitian descent, had been deported from the Dominican Republic to Haiti twice. The first time, in March 1999, Dominican migration agents picked Méndez up on Máximo Gómez Street in Santo Domingo and put him on a bus holding about fifty other detainees, not asking to see his documents or questioning him about his legal status. The second time he was deported, in February 2000, the officials ripped up the photocopy of his identification that he showed them. Both times he ended up in Haiti penniless, having to beg for food and shelter.","Americas, Dominican Republic",""

The organization reminds all parties that even in times of armed conflict, they are obliged to respect international humanitarian law, especially the principle of civilian immunity.  “It doesn´t matter whether you call it resistance, self-defense, or a war against terror. No political or security objective can justify targeting and punishing the civilian population of an adversary,” said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch calls on all parties to reassert their commitment to the fundamental standards governing the conduct of hostilities. These include an absolute prohibition against deliberately targeting civilians; the need to discriminate between military and civilian targets; and the obligation to ensure access to medical treatment for the wounded.  Human Rights Watch once more vigorously condemns attacks on civilians by armed Palestinian groups, which in less than a week have sent suicide bombers to kill some forty civilians. The organization calls on President Yasir Arafat, as well as leaders of armed groups such as Hamas, Islamic Jihad, and the al-Aqsa Brigades, to immediately halt all attacks on civilians, to order an end to such attacks, and to condemn them unequivocally.  Human Rights Watch also strongly deplores IDF measures that disproportionately harm civilians. These include prolonged curfews with severe restrictions on the movement of emergency medical personnel; the extensive destruction of homes and civilian property; the coerced involvement of civilians to assist military operations; and disturbing but unverified reports of the use of lethal force against civilians, especially those attempting to move during periods of declared curfew.  Human Rights Watch is also deeply concerned at the IDF´s refusal to permit independent media and human rights groups access to monitor and report on the impact of these measures. The organization expresses particular concern at reports that the IDF has forcibly entered offices of Palestinian human rights groups and the office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, and, in at least one case, has detained a staff member. “There is a desperate need for independent monitors to accurately report and verify what is happening on the ground,” said Megally. “Restrictions on the media and on rights monitors—Israeli and international as well as Palestinian—undermine their ability to deter abuse.”  The organization is alarmed at increasing signs of a breakdown in law and order and in military discipline. These include reports that IDF soldiers may have executed Palestinian security forces members after having surrendered or been captured, and the execution by masked Palestinians of eleven or more Palestinians who had been in PA custody for alleged collaboration with Israel.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

On March 30, the Tunis Appeals Court upheld their convictions by a trial court that denied the defendants their right to present a defense against the charges they faced These three men are in prison solely for their political beliefs and nonviolent political activities,” said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. “They should never have been charged and tried in the first place.” After a hearing on March 30, the Appeals Court upheld the conviction of the defendants on charges that included membership in the banned Tunisian Communist Workers Party (Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens, PCOT), distributing leaflets and spreading “false information” capable of “disturbing the public order,” and inciting people to violate the laws of the country. Nevertheless, the Appeals Court reduced the original prison sentences against the three, giving Hammami three years and two months, Taâmallah twenty-one months, and Maddouri twenty-one months plus an additional two years on a contempt-of-court charge.  Human Rights Watch sent observers to the original 1999 trial, at which the Tunis Court of First Instance convicted the three men in absentia. All eighteen of their codefendants were convicted and all but one imprisoned. On February 2, 2002, the three voluntarily emerged from hiding to challenge their convictions, only to have them confirmed in a hearing that same day in which the defendants were denied their rights to prepare a defense and contest the evidence against them. Before the hearing had begun, policemen entered the courtroom and seized and removed the three defendants. This measure prompted a protest walkout by the entire defense team. The defendants were later escorted in a disheveled state to a different courtroom, where they stated that police had beaten them.  Even though Hammami, Maddouri, and Taâmallah were entitled by Tunisian law to a new trial since they were absent from their first trial, no genuine hearing took place at the February 2 session. Presiding judge Mustapha Kaâbachi simply announced their conviction on the same charges for which they had been convicted in absentia in 1999. He re-imposed long prison sentences on the three men, to be served immediately, and gave Maddouri an additional two-year term for comments he allegedly made that day that were ruled as insulting to the court. Maddouri had no opportunity to answer to the new charge and was not present when the judge convicted and sentenced him for it.  According to Ridha Khemakhem, a justice ministry official interviewed by Human Rights Watch on March 7, the defendants did not speak at their February 2 hearing because they had refused to do so. But this account was rejected by numerous Tunisian lawyers and international observers who had been present that day. They stated that the judge gave the defendants no opportunity to contest the earlier conviction, and did not even fulfill the formal requirement of confirming their identities at the outset.  Human Rights Watch observed the opening of the appeals court hearing on March 9, at which presiding judge Tahar Sliti agreed to adjourn the case until March 30 but rejected defense motions to free the defendants pending a definitive ruling in their case.  While some international observers were permitted to attend the March 9 and March 30 appeals hearings, numerous others were forbidden access to the court on both occasions. Police also barred without explanation access to some relatives of the defendants, many of their supporters, and members of the public.  In addition, since the imprisonment of the defendants on February 2, their lawyers have encountered repeated obstacles to meeting with them in order to prepare their defense. Radhia Nasraoui, a lawyer and Hammami’s wife, stated that on April 1 the Appeals Court refused to authorize her to visit Hammami on the grounds that the trial had concluded. In fact, Hammami and his co-defendants must still decide whether to petition the Court of Cassation for an annulment of the verdict.  Hammami, Taâmallah, and Maddouri all admitted to the court on March 30 their membership in the PCOT, but claimed they were being tried merely for exercising their political rights. Tolerated in the late 1980s but never legalized, the small leftist party has been systematically persecuted during the past decade. Its members have been imprisoned repeatedly on charges that are commonly used in Tunisia to repress nonviolent political dissent, including those that were confirmed by the Appeals Court in the case of Hammami, Taâmallah, and Maddouri on March 30.  The written verdict in the February 2 trial explained that conviction on the charge of spreading “false information” capable of “disturbing the public order” was warranted by statements found in PCOT tracts such as: “the repressive regime does all it can to prevent the mobilization of the people so that it will remain ignorant,” and “the victims of capitalist exploitation, repression and corruption, today constitute the majority of society.”","Europe/Central Asia, Russia, Spain, Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

The ICC will be the first standing court of its kind, a permanent international criminal tribunal with potentially global reach to try individuals responsible for the most serious human rights crimes: genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity such as systematic torture, enforced disappearance, or rape. The ICC was created because national court systems--from Guatemala to Sierra Leone to Iraq--have failed to provide justice to the victims of egregious crimes.

In January 2000, Human Rights Watch, working with Chadian groups, initially convinced a Senegalese judge to arrest Habré on charges of torture and crimes against humanity - until Senegalese appeals courts, under pressure from a new president, dismissed the case. As a fallback, HRW helped the Chadian victims file criminal charges against Habré in Belgium, whose courts have broad jurisdiction over serious human rights crimes. From February 26 to March 7, a Belgian investigating judge and a police team visited N'Djamena, Chad, with the cooperation of the Chadian government. The visit was front-page news in Chad and transformed the abstract case against Habré in far-off courts into a concrete reality, touching off a firestorm in a country where Habré's most brutal henchman still occupy most of the key security posts. The team visited the five N'Djamena jails as former inmates demonstrated how they were held and tortured. Ex-prisoners led the judge to the sites where they were forced to dig mass graves for those who died in detention. The judge also took the testimony of a number of Habré's aides, and even allowed former victims to confront their torturers. The victims now hope that the judge will indict Habré and seek his extradition from Senegal, which has so far heeded pressure not to let Habré flee pending such a request.

Human Rights Watch describes the killings and widespread destruction carried out by soldiers in more than seven towns and villages in Benue State as a form of collective punishment: the soldiers were revenging the murder of nineteen soldiers attributed to armed men from the Tiv ethnic group.   """"Western governments, especially the U.S. and the U.K, are muting their criticism of these abuses in order to preserve close ties with Nigeria in the struggle against terrorism and in their policy on Zimbabwe,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"They need to be more frank about the Obasanjo government's human rights record.""""   Human Rights Watch's report, """"Military Revenge in Benue: A Population Under Attack,"""" contains extensive testimonies of eye-witnesses and victims collected in December 2001 in the various towns and villages where soldiers engaged in killing and destruction.   Witnesses describe how, in several locations, soldiers assembled the population and pretended they were holding a peace meeting before opening fire on the crowd. In the village of Gbeji alone, more than 150 people were shot dead in cold blood or burned alive. In the market town of Zaki-Biam, between twenty and thirty people were killed, mostly in and around the market. Soldiers destroyed homes, shops, and public buildings in several other locations, including Vaase, Kyado, Tse-Adoor, Anyiin, and Sankera.   The testimonies demonstrate that the soldiers were not acting spontaneously or in self-defense, as some governments officials claimed, but rather as part of a planned and coordinated operation. They entered towns and villages with the clear intention of killing and destroying. In several instances, commanders gave the signal for soldiers to open fire. Soldiers made explicit statements indicating that the Tiv as a whole were being made to pay the price for the death of the nineteen soldiers. For example, in Zaki-Biam, soldiers made the passengers of a bus disembark, and asked whether there were any non-Tivs among them. When the passengers said no, they separated the men from the women, ordered the men to lie down, and starting shooting at them. Approximately ten people were killed.   The Human Rights Watch report also describes human rights abuses by the military in Benue since October 2001. Soldiers stationed around the town of Katsina-Ala, who were not withdrawn until March 2002, were responsible for several cases of rape and persistent ill-treatment of civilians, extortion, and looting. Soldiers regularly insulted Tiv as they passed through military roadblocks, saying, in one case: """"You're Tiv, we will destroy you.""""   Human Rights Watch criticized the absence of any investigation or prosecution for the actions of the soldiers in Benue. After months of silence, the commission of inquiry announced by the government in November was only inaugurated in March. Its remit is vague; it extends well beyond events in Benue to cover the causes of conflicts in several other states, and contains no specific reference to the need to investigate these killings by the military.   """"President Olusegun Obasanjo and other government and military authorities have failed to recognize the gravity of these atrocities perpetrated by the soldiers,"""" said Takirambudde. """"These are clear cases of extrajudicial executions which contravene Nigeria's national and international obligations.""""   Human Rights Watch also criticized the public silence of foreign governments in the aftermath of the Benue massacres, pointing to the influence that particularly the United States and the United Kingdom could have exerted on Nigeria, in the light of their close diplomatic links. The U.S. provided military training to the Nigerian armed forces in fiscal year 2001, and continues to provide forms of military assistance in 2002. Human Rights Watch is calling for all such assistance to be linked to measurable progress in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the killings in Benue, as well as those responsible for a similar military reprisal operation in Odi, in the southern state of Bayelsa, in November 1999, which cost hundreds of lives.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Nigeria, United Kingdom, US Foreign Policy",""

Human Rights Commission meeting today in Geneva to increase the number of monitors reporting on the ongoing war in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in the Democratic Republic of Congo makes her report to the commission today. “All the words in the world do little to help the victims suffering daily from this deadly war,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser on the Great Lakes in the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “But more monitors in the field could deter some of the worst abuses against civilians. By documenting crimes, outside observers make justice possible and may even make killers and rapists think twice before targeting civilians.” The Field Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights has some 20 human rights officers in the Congo, but too few to monitor abuses throughout the vast territory. A U.N. peacekeeping force known as MONUC also has positions allocated for human rights observers, but some of them remain vacant. In addition, observers from the two systems fail to coordinate their actions effectively. Human Rights Watch urged the Human Rights Commission to allocate more funds for monitors and to press the Security Council to recruit and deploy monitors assigned to MONUC as rapidly as possible, particularly in the troubled eastern Congo. The Security Council should also direct child protection and humanitarian advisers as well as human rights monitors attached to MONUC to accompany military observers into areas of conflict. Although the ceasefire established by the Lusaka Agreement has ended fighting along the frontlines, soldiers of the Congolese, Rwandan, and Ugandan armies as well as a number of armed groups continue military operations in the eastern Congo far distant from the front lines. Civilians are regularly targeted in these clashes. In recent months in the Ugandan-held areas of northeastern Congo, thousands of civilians have died and tens of thousands more been displaced in clashes between Hema and Lendu ethnic militia. Fighting between the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) and its rival, the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) has aggravated the situation, as has interference by Ugandan soldiers. In the Rwandan-dominated region of South Kivu, Congolese Tutsi known as Banyamulenge are fighting against the Rwandan army and its local ally, the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma). Some people of the Bambembe and Bafulero groups reportedly have joined the Banyamulenge to challenge Rwandans, whom they regard as an occupying army and the RCD-Goma. On March 20 the insurgents ousted RCD-Goma troops from the area of Minembwe. Local sources report that Rwandan reinforcements have moved to the area, perhaps to assist the RCD-Goma in trying to retake the region. “Denouncing these horrors is not enough,” said Des Forges. “The U.N. must find the resources and the political will to put monitors out there so that abusers will be known and can be held accountable for their crimes.”","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","United Nations"

Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest in Rangoon. Serious human rights violations have occurred in Burma since the violent suppression of the pro-democracy movement in 1988.  """"With this sentence, the Burmese government is making it clear that it will crush any and all dissent,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The harshness of the sentence suggests that, political dialogue notwithstanding, the Rangoon regime is fundamentally unchanged.""""  Dr. Salai Tun Than, seventy-four years old, was arrested for conducting a peaceful protest on November 29, 2001, in front of the Rangoon City Hall. He distributed copies of a petition letter calling on the Burmese government to hold a general election in one year and to transfer power to the winners. Burma has refused to implement the results of the May 1990 election that was overwhelmingly won by the National League for Democracy (NLD).  Dr. Salai, retired from Yezin University in Pyinmana, Upper Burma, was convicted under Article 5(j) of the 1950 Emergency Provisions Act, a sweeping provision that says any person who """"infringes on the integrity, health, conduct and respect of State military organizations and government employees,"""" or """"spreads false news about the government"""" or """"disrupts the morality or the behavior of a group of people"""" shall be sentenced to up to seven years in prison.  In a written submission to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, the Special Rapporteur for Burma, condemned controls on freedom of expression under more than half a dozen laws, including the Emergency Provisions Act of 1950, noting that these laws are frequently used to imprison people for peacefully expressing their views or even for reading materials deemed illegal. He welcomed the release of some Burmese political prisoners since the beginning of 2001, but said that the unconditional release of all political prisoners """"is a pre-requisite for moving to the next phase of talks"""" between the NLD and the government. Pinheiro is due to report on March 28 on the results of his most recent fact finding trip, and the Commission will later consider a resolution on human rights in Burma, which should include strong recommendations, Human Rights Watch said.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)","United Nations"

Yesterday, the court commuted the death sentence of Safiya Hussaini Tungar-Tudu, who was sentenced to death by stoning by a Sharia (Islamic) court in October 2001. But the court decision was based on a technicality - that the alleged act of adultery had been committed before Sharia law was imposed in the region - and even as news of the decision was released, reports arose of another woman in northern Nigeria being sentenced to death for adultery.  """"We're glad that the life of Safiya Hussaini has been spared,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But even if this battle has been won, the struggle continues against this kind of cruel punishment. The death penalty is inherently cruel, and death by stoning is a kind of torture that is prohibited by international law.""""  Human Rights Watch urged government authorities in Nigeria to ensure that other death sentences are also commuted and that courts refrain from sentencing people to cruel, inhuman and degrading punishments.  Several other people have been sentenced to death since Sharia was extended to cover criminal cases in many parts of northern Nigeria. In September 2001, a man accused of sodomy for the rape of a seven-year-old boy was sentenced to death by stoning in Kebbi State. In January 2002, Nigeria saw the first execution under Sharia when a man accused of murder in Katsina was hanged. Sharia courts have also sentenced people to amputations and floggings. Trials have often been characterized by an absence of due process, since judges are poorly trained, and many defendants do not have legal representation.","Africa, Nigeria","Women's Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/25/missing-point-hague","Missing the Point in The Hague","Missing the Point in The Hague","","03/25/2002","Since the beginning of the trial of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav media have been flooded with praise for Milosevic's defense. If you were relying on this commentary alone, you would have to conclude that Milosevic is getting the better of the tribunal prosecutors. In fact, while the media are wowed by Milosevic's spririted defense, they are missing the real story unfolding in the Hague - a detailed account of specific criminal acts committed in Kosovo. Milosevic's response-while perhaps politically and historically interesting, distracting, and entertaining-has been to a great extent legally irrelevant to the charges he faces. Take last week's testimony and cross-examination of Bajram Bucaliu from the village of Staro Selo as an example. Bucaliu testified that on April 5, 1999 a group of paramilitaries entered the village and for the next week terrorized its population. The paramilitaries forced the villagers to dig trenches; they took away their vehicles and money; and, threatened that the villagers would be used as human shields should NATO soldiers invade the country. On April 13, according to the witness, the paramilitaries killed three villagers and kidnapped four more, whose bodies were found only after the war. That was too much for the villagers, and in the morning after the killing, all of them fled the village for Urosevac, where they boarded a train for Macedonia. Milosevic did not seriously refute any of these claims. As part of his general defense strategy to show that the Albanians were actually fleeing the NATO bombardment, Milosevic asked about NATO bombs that exploded in the village. The witness answered that the bombing took place only after the villagers had fled and that the bombs destroyed Yugoslav army vehicles rather than civilian objects. Bucaliu's testimony strongly suggests that the Albanians had to leave because the paramilitaries subjected them to humiliation and forced labor, robbed them of their valuables and ultimately murdered some of the villagers. This is precisely the point the prosecution is aiming to prove at this stage of the trial. The prosecution must still present evidence of the connection between Milosevic and the crimes, but logically this element of the case should come at a further stage of the proceedings. To undermine Bucaliu's testimony, Milosevic asked several questions suggesting that members of the Bucaliu family were petty criminals and that in 1981 Bucaliu himself had broken a window and stolen something from a store. Presiding judge Richard May stopped Milosevic at that point, noting that even if Milosevic's smearing of Bucaliu and his family were based on facts, it would not fundamentally challenge the crux of Bucaliu's testimony-that in Spring 1999 Serb forces compelled the Albanians from Staro Selo to flee. Serb media covering the trial are impressed by Milosevic's audacity and his detailed knowledge of the witnesses and the events in Kosovo. But as Judge May suggested regarding the Bucaliu testimony, Milosevic's strategy achieves little. Indeed, it only demonstrates that he has always been in a position to know just about everything happening in Kosovo-including the criminal campaign to ethnically cleanse the territory, allegedly committed by security forces under his command. Where do the panegyrics concerning Milosevic's performance come from? For almost a decade now, and for a variety of political, social, and even psychological reasons, the public and opinion-makers in Serbia have been responsive to any argument any ICTY-basher could muster. This fundamental and widespread hostility has translated, unsurprisingly, into a flagrant misreading of the nature of the Milosevic trial and of the ICTY's work in general. The Prosecution bears some blame for the confusion, having started the case by presenting the political and historical context for the alleged 1999 crimes - the only Kosovo crimes for which Milosevic faces charges. Many domestic analysts over-emphasized the trial's opening days-including the testimony of the first prosecution witness, politician Mahmut Bakali-and, venting long-held resentment and suspicion of the tribunal, they proclaimed the trial """"political."""" These analysts are still feigning not to see that the trial has long since unfolded as a standard criminal trial that is focused on nitty-gritty details related to specific crimes in specific sites during 1999. It took years before the critics in Belgrade gave up certain widely-held prejudices about the ICTY: about its """"anonymous witnesses,"""" """"secret indictments,"""" the alleged prohibition in the Yugoslav constitution to surrender of indictees, and others. It will hopefully take less time for observers in Belgrade to shift their focus from the tangential features of the trial against Milosevic to its essence. And the essence is not the attempt to apportion political responsibility among various individuals and communities in the former Yugoslavia, but to establish facts about many crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia through 1990s. It remains to be seen whether the prosecution will be able to prove the criminal responsibility of Slobodan Milosevic and the others indicted for these crimes. What should and can be achieved in the meantime is to clarify the Tribunal's mandate and methods as a criminal court, trying to determine who committed which crimes--what, where, when, and how in as fair and balanced a way possible.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Fourteen witnesses have told Human Rights Watch researchers in the field about torture and ill-treatment, forced disappearances, and the discovery of the corpses and burned remains of nine people that took place during the March 6-11 sweep operation in Staryi Atagi, 25 miles south of Grozny.  The U.N. Commission on Human Rights is scheduled to debate Russia's conduct of the Chechnya operation next week in Geneva.  """"The Russians have a lot of explaining to do,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The government says it has taken measures to improve the conduct of forces on sweep operations, but they're not working and the situation is deteriorating. The U.N. commission should adopt a resolution on Chechnya that makes this clear."""" In a sweep operation, Russian forces typically seal off a village and conduct house-to-house searches, ostensibly to detain suspected fighters or their supporters. At least two prior sweep operations have taken place in Staryi Atagi since January 2002. Federal authorities claim Staryi Atagi harbors rebel fighters.  At least ten men """"disappeared"""" in the Staryi Atagi operation; the corpses or burned remains of nine people were found, raising fears that they were extrajudicially executed. So far, the remains of only one of the """"disappeared,"""" 26-year old Imran Kuntaev, detained on March 6, were found the next day in a house that had just been burned. A witness told Human Rights Watch that on the morning of March 6, uniformed troops detained Imran Kuntaev in his home. On March 7, 2002, a fire burned down an abandoned house on Nagornaia Street, which Russian troops had been blocking off. When the fire was extinguished, four bodies were found in the smoldering remains. Imran Kunatev's relatives identified him by his teeth, four of which were gold. Villagers believe that the remains of two more persons were burnt to coals.  On March 9, three additional bodies-all unidentified-were found in a burned-out vehicle at the edge the village. The car reportedly had been confiscated on March 7 from a shop where it was under repair.  Under the much-lauded Decree No. 46 of the procuracy general, adopted after notoriously harsh sweeps in June and July 2001, officials on sweep operations are supposed to compile a comprehensive list of all detainees. This list would indicate the grounds for detention, and information about who took the individual into custody and where the detainee was taken. It further required officials to inform relatives of the detainees of their whereabouts. While such a list exists, the ten """"disappeared"""" detainees are not on it. Among them was 30-year-old Adlan Baisarov, who subsequently """"disappeared."""" His cousin told Human Rights Watch: """"The [soldiers] come practically every day to check [our passports], and he never had any problems before. I asked why they took him, if they had found anything. They said that they weren't taking him, and they were just going to talk."""" The cousin received information from a local official that all of the Staryi Atagi detainees had been transferred to the district Federal Security Service in Tolstoy-Yurt, but when she went there officials denied holding Baisarov. Adlan Baisarov, who has two small children, suffers from rheumatism and a liver condition.  Amir Pokaev, 20, also """"disappeared"""" on March 6. A male relative told Human Rights Watch that when Russian forces arrived at the home, """"They lined us up [the men], and took our passports. They gave everyone's passport back except Amir's. Then they came and said Amir had to come with them. They said that they would bring him back."""" That was last time any relatives saw Pokaev. The local military commander told the relative that no one by Pokaev's name had been detained. Relatives have inquired to the procuracy, local detention centers, and other places about his whereabouts but have received no answers.  """"Decree 46 was a welcome step, but it clearly isn't being fully implemented to prevent forced disappearances,"""" said Andersen. """"Nor is it fully preventing mistreatment of detainees."""" Some of the detainees were taken to a nearby poultry farm that had previously also been used as a short-term detention facility, and there they were mistreated. Among the detainees was a seventeen-year old who told Human Rights Watch that Russian soldiers at the poultry farm tried to coerce him into giving information on the whereabouts of rebel fighters. The soldiers pinched and twisted the skin on his chest, arms and legs with medical tweezers; they then shoved the tweezers up his nose and then into his mouth, threatening to take out his teeth. He also said that he had seen other detainees being beaten. Some villagers report that Russian soldiers tried to extort money and valuables from them in exchange for not taking their sons. After detaining him outside, soldiers brought Aslan Akhmadov to his home, where they demanded that his family pay 10,000 rubles (about U.S. $300) for his release. His mother, Arzu Akhmadova, told Human Rights Watch that Akhmadov was bloody, apparently from having been beaten. Akhmadova said soldiers took about $200 and a pair of gold earrings-all the family could gather-and promised to release Akhmadov after checking his documents. Arzu Akhmadov has not been able to get any information about her son since that time.  Only after residents held a mass protest on March 12 in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, did the office of the prosecutor (the procuracy) open criminal investigations into the Staryi Atagi sweep. Russian authorities at first tried to dismiss the need for an investigation, by implying that the individuals whose remains were found were linked with Zelimkhan Sadayev, a Chechen fighter who was killed during the sweep operation. They also tried to persuade residents to bury the bodies immediately, which would have precluded a forensic examination.  The village elders have been told that basic identification to ascertain blood type, height, and stomach contents of those killed would be given to them by the end of March, and the bodies would be returned for burial shortly thereafter. There are no indications, however, that the Russian authorities intend to use other forensic methods or DNA technology to match the remains to the missing.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern that given Russia's past record on accountability, the investigation into the Staryi Atagi killings would not bring those responsible to justice. Hundreds of cases have been opened, but many have been suspended and very few have led to prosecutions. """"Russia has a sorry record on accountability for abuse in Chechnya,"""" said Andersen. """"And meanwhile, there is no official record of the atrocities that are being perpetrated. The U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva must prevail upon Russia to invite special U.N. investigators on extrajudicial executions and torture. They can establish an official record of these abuses.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/21/indict-saddam","Indict Saddam","Indict Saddam","","03/21/2002","The Bush administration's frustration with a decade of increasingly porous sanctions against Iraq has led to active consideration of military action. Yet one alternative has yet to be seriously tried -- indicting Saddam Hussein for his many atrocities, particularly the 1988 genocide against Iraqi Kurds. As deposed Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic discovered, indictment for grave abuses can delegitimize a dictator and undermine his grasp on power. Even if Saddam escapes arrest, his indictment for heinous crimes would demonstrate that Iraq's desire for normal international relations is a pipe dream so long as Saddam is at the helm. That would weaken Saddam's support among the many governments that have been lining up for years to do commercial deals with him in anticipation of an end to sanctions. It would also encourage Iraqi officials to overthrow him. Cowardice Unfortunately, governmental cowardice and opportunism have stymied past attempts to indict Saddam, as Human Rights Watch learned during its intensive efforts to bring him to justice in the 1990s. At the top of any indictment should be Saddam's 1988 genocidal Anfal campaign against Iraqi Kurds, described by Jeffrey Goldberg in this week's New Yorker. Named after a Koranic verse justifying pillage of the property of infidels, the Anfal campaign unfolded as the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war was winding down. Iraqi Kurds had taken advantage of Saddam's preoccupation with Iran to seize control of parts of mountainous northern Iraq. But as soon as Iraqi troops could be withdrawn from the Iranian front, Saddam shifted them to the north. Several thousand Kurdish villages were destroyed, forcing residents to live in appalling camps. In at least 40 cases, Iraqi forces under Saddam's cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, used chemical weapons to kill and chase Kurds from their villages. Then, during the Anfal campaign from February to September 1988, Iraqi troops swept through the highlands of Iraqi Kurdistan rounding up everyone who remained in government-declared """"prohibited zones."""" Some 100,000 Kurds, mostly men and boys, were trucked to remote sites and executed. Only seven are known to have escaped. The full scope of the Anfal horror became known only after Saddam's defeat in the Gulf War. The Iraqi military's withdrawal from the region in October 1991 after the imposition of a no-fly zone made it feasible for the first time in years for outsiders to reach the area. Human Rights Watch investigators took advantage of this opening to enter northern Iraq and document Saddam's crimes. Some 350 witnesses and survivors were interviewed. Mass graves were exhumed. And Kurdish rebels were convinced to hand over some 18 tons of documents that they had seized during the brief post-war uprising from Iraqi police stations. These documents were airlifted to Washington, where Human Rights Watch researchers poured through this treasure trove of information about the inner workings of a ruthless regime. With this extraordinarily detailed evidence of genocide, Human Rights Watch launched a campaign to bring Saddam to justice. At the time the U.N. Security Council was creating special tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, but there was no consensus for similar action on Iraq. France and Russia, each with extensive business interests in Iraq, threatened to wield their veto. China, worried about analogies to its treatment of Tibetans, was disinclined to support an International Criminal Tribunal for Iraq. With no International Criminal Court then in the works, and the Pinochet option of exercising universal jurisdiction in national courts not yet widely recognized, the prospect of criminal prosecution was remote. Human Rights Watch thus turned to the only available remedy -- a civil suit before the International Court of Justice in The Hague, commonly known as the World Court. The relevant U.N. treaty -- the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide -- assigned the World Court the task of adjudicating disputes under the treaty. We hoped for a declaratory judgment that the Iraqi government had committed genocide, damages for the survivors, and an order that the perpetrators be prosecuted. The problem was that only governments can bring suit before the World Court. Washington was a logical first choice, and ultimately the Clinton administration endorsed the case. But restrictions in the U.S. ratification of the Genocide Convention stood in the way of a successful suit. Human Rights Watch staff then circled the globe trying to convince another government to bring the suit. None would. At best, a couple of governments said they would join a coalition to bring the case, but only on the condition that at least one European government joined as well. Several European governments gave the matter serious consideration, but in the end none would take the plunge. There were many reasons for this reluctance, some stated openly, others only hinted at. Governments feared the loss of business opportunities when Iraq emerged from U.N. sanctions. They feared a loss of influence in the Middle East for suing an Arab state. They feared terrorist retaliation by Iraqi agents. And they feared the expense of bringing the lawsuit (although offers were made to raise the funds). This frustrating experience highlighted the importance of an International Criminal Court -- that is, a global tribunal that does not depend on the political courage of individual governments or the vagaries of consensus among the veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council. But the ICC will apply only to crimes that are committed after the treaty takes effect in several weeks. Many governments are ratifying the ICC treaty as an insurance policy against future Saddams. But the court cannot act retroactively on a crime such as the Anfal genocide. Security Council The best option remains Security Council action to establish an International Criminal Tribunal for Iraq, since the council would be free to grant the tribunal jurisdiction over past crimes. But council action depends on overcoming the veto of Russia, France and China. To date, that obstacle has been insurmountable, although no effort has been made in the post-Sept. 11 climate. Saddam could also be prosecuted by any government that has given its courts universal jurisdiction for the crime of genocide, although in this case the actions of a single government would probably carry less weight than the pronouncements of an international court. Finally, one or more governments could sue in the World Court for a declaration that Iraq had committed genocide. Regardless of the approach, formal condemnation of Saddam for such a heinous crime would signal definitively to Iraqis and Saddam's international sympathizers that he is beyond the pale -- not simply because of the threat he poses to others, but also because he has flouted the most basic norms on the treatment of his own people. That delegitimization would not guarantee his ouster, but it would certainly help build consensus that he is unfit to govern, and thus that something must be done to end his rule.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq",""

The rules nevertheless fail to meet the core human rights requirement of appellate review by an independent and impartial court, or to meet the requirements of the Geneva Conventions. They also leave intact the sweeping military jurisdiction over non-citizens contained in President Bush's November 13 order authorizing military trial of suspected terrorists.  The Administration went a long way towards meeting human rights concerns and preserving the reputation of U.S. military justice. But, under the rules, the president still remains both prosecutor and judge,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. program. """"There is no security rationale or other justification for denying persons tried by the commissions the right of appeal to a court outside the military chain of command.""""  The rules limit appellate review of the commissions to a specially created panel appointed by the Secretary of Defense. Any civilian appointed to the panel would be temporarily deputized as a military officer. The rules do not permit appeal to U.S. federal courts or to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, which is composed of civilians and is independent of the executive branch. The rules leave standing the provision in the November 13 order giving the president final review of commission convictions and sentences.  The failure of the Bush administration to properly determine the legal status of prisoners held by the U.S. armed forces brings into question who can properly be tried by the military commissions. Under the Geneva Conventions, prisoners-of war (POWs) responsible for war crimes and other offenses should be tried by regular military courts-martial. Military commissions may only be used to try non-POWs engaged in armed conflict against the United States. Under President Bush's order, he may unilaterally subject to trial by military commission any non-U.S. citizen suspected being a terrorist, including noncombatants or persons who are not members of al-Qaeda. The rules announced today deny any recourse to a civilian court to determine the lawfulness of military detention and trial by military commission.  The rules for the military commissions do provide many other fair trial guarantees not included in the November 13 order, including making the trials public, requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt for conviction, establishing the presumption of innocence, providing access to a defense attorney and permitting the defendant to see the prosecution's evidence and to cross-examine witnesses. While Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all cases, it welcomed the Pentagon's decision to require unanimity before the commission can impose the death penalty.  Human Rights Watch was also concerned about the absence of any period of public comment before the regulations go into affect. The Bush administration rejected such a comment period, citing """"the need to move decisively and expeditiously in the ongoing war against terrorism.""""

Human Rights Watch called on President Akaev to ensure that police not use unnecessary lethal force. According to media accounts, on March 17, an estimated 500 to 2,000 protesters were on their way to the village of Kerben in southern Aksy district when they were blocked by police and special forces. The protesters had gathered to call for the release of parliamentarian Azimbek Beknazarov, then in custody awaiting the verdict in his trial on charges that supporters say were politically motivated. Although details of the incident are unclear, there are consistent reports that police opened fire on the protesters; five were killed and at least eighteen were wounded. Thirteen of those wounded, including a sixteen-year-old who was shot in the chest, required hospitalization for bullet wounds.  """"International law is very clear regarding the use of force during public demonstrations,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The deaths of protestors from police gunfire is more than a tragedy, it may be a crime,"""" added Andersen.  Government authorities said some forty-seven police officers were injured by protestors who allegedly threw stones at officers who refused to let them continue their march.  Minister of Internal Affairs Temirbek Akmataliev blamed the deaths of the demonstrators on human rights activists. According to the BBC, on March 19 he said, """"I think that today with all responsibility we can say that the blame for the blood of the deceased lies on Tursunbek Akunov and his associates."""" Akunov, head of the Human Rights Movement of Kyrgyzstan, was among those arrested on March 17. He was subsequently released.

The ten-year civil war in Sierra Leone was marked by unusually brutal crimes, such as the hacking off of limbs of men, women and children, and turning women and children into """"sexual slaves"""" that were kept and used by combatants.

Human Rights Watch hailed important advances in human rights protection under the government of Alejandro Toledo, but noted that the anti-terrorism laws remain in effect and some 2,500 prisoners who were convicted by anti-terrorism courts without due process remain incarcerated.     """"Despite strong efforts to restore the rule of law trampled on during the ten-year rule of Alberto Fujimori, the government has yet not tackled the sweeping anti-terrorism laws that have trapped thousands of Peruvians in a legal nightmare,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.     Elected on a human rights platform, the Toledo government is making efforts to hold accountable those responsible for the widespread corruption and human rights abuse of the Fujimori years.

While those responsible for more than 4,000 """"disappearances"""" during the counter-insurgency war (1980-2000) have so far escaped justice, Peru has swept aside a 1995 amnesty intended to protect them from prosecution. A truth commission established to investigate the events is expected to publish its findings in February 2003.     Some 2,500 Peruvians remain incarcerated under the anti-terrorism laws, which date from 1992. Convicted following torture, often by hooded military judges and without proper opportunities of defense, they are now clamoring for their cases to be reviewed. A high proportion are serving life sentences.     Following a policy introduced by former President Fujimori, the Toledo administration has pardoned and released clearly innocent prisoners. It has also granted requests, including those made by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, to allow civilian retrials in a few high profile cases. The civilian court retrial of American citizen Lori Berenson was mandated under Fujimori.     Human Rights Watch is urging the Peruvian government to order the civilian retrial of all prisoners whose basic due process rights were violated. Rights to defense and cross-examination, open courtroom procedures, and the elimination of evidence obtained under torture must be guaranteed. Laws against terrorism must be revised so as to define precisely the nature of the offenses, and make the penalties proportionate to the seriousness of the crime.","Americas, Peru","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture, Detention without Trial"

But what mattered to the Uzbek warlords in power in his hometown was that he was an ethnic Pashtun, and probably had brought back some money from work in Iran. Three Uzbek commanders took Achter Mohammed straight from the bus to their military base and began beating him with heavy wooden sticks, repeatedly leaving him unconscious. They stole everything he had worked so hard for in Iran, including his presents for his family. When they finally released him, he returned home to find everything there gone, too. Fourteen-year-old Fatima had begged the Hazara soldiers not to rape her, saying she was young and a virgin. One of the soldiers threatened her with his gun, ordering her to undress or be killed. Two different soldiers raped her, and then three others raped her mother. The mother asked why the soldiers were doing these things. She was told """"You are Talibs and you are Pashtun."""" Before leaving, the soldiers beat Fatima's crippled father unconscious, and carried off all of the family's possessions. """"There is nothing left for us; marriage and honor are gone,"""" Fatima's mother told us. For ethnic Pashtuns in northern Afghanistan, it is payback time. They are paying for the sins of the Taliban, simply because most of the Taliban leadership were also ethnic Pashtuns. In the past month, Human Rights Watch has visited dozens of Pashtun communities in northern Afghanistan, personally documenting the devastation. We visited village after village that had been stripped bare by ethnic militias who had sometimes even taken the window frames. We found case after case of beatings, looting, murders, extortion and sexual violence against Pashtun communities. In one village 37 men had been killed in front of their families because they did not have enough money to buy their own lives. Many of the villages were like ghost towns, abandoned by hundreds of Pashtun families after weeks or months of attacks. And the violence has not stopped. Our sudden arrival scared off two armed Uzbek men who had come to extort money from the Pashtun elders in one village in Faryab province. In Samangan province, 200 miles away, a village elder had been forced to give up his flock of sheep to a local commander the morning of our visit. Parts of Afghanistan today are beginning to look a bit like they did in the 1992-96 period when warlords carved up the country and brutally abused the civilian population. That era gave rise to the Taliban. Some of those same warlords are back in power in northern Afghanistan, and their forces are responsible for most of the abuses against Pashtun civilians in the north. Our research implicated all three major factions -- the ethnic Uzbek Junbish party, the ethnic Tajik Jamiat party, and the ethnic Hazara Hizb-i-Wahdat party -- in the offenses against Pashtun civilians. America helped put these abusive warlords back in power: They provided the Afghan troops the United States needed to get rid of the Taliban and al Qaeda. Now America and its allies need to act fast to ensure that these same warlords do not destroy what has been accomplished so far. Afghans are sick and tired of the warlords who abuse them and control their lives, but they can't challenge the warlords' monopoly on power without some outside help. In one abandoned village we found just one old man, but he spoke for many when he told us, """"If the foreigners don't help us, we won't be alive."""" Let us not forget that America walked away from Afghanistan once, leaving the country in the hands of the warlords, and that on Sept. 11 an unfathomable price was paid for that mistake. We owe it not only to the people of Afghanistan but to ourselves to see the job through this time.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/20/peru-human-rights-after-fujimori-0","Peru- Human Rights After Fujimori","Peru: Human Rights After Fujimori","","03/20/2002","Since the collapse of the corrupt Fujimori government in November 2000 the human rights situation in Peru has improved significantly. During Fujimori's last term in office (1995-2000), Vladimiro Montesinos, the de facto head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN) and a close Fujimori advisor, used a combination of bribes and extortion to control state institutions such as the armed forces, the police, the tax office, the electoral authorities, and the judiciary. Human rights abuses, including extrajudicial executions, torture, and intimidation occurred frequently and were systematically covered up. Recent steps to strengthen human rights protection in Peru have been part of a wider effort to restore the rule of law. The administration of President Alejandro Toledo has built on the advances of the interim government in investigating abuses and holding those responsible accountable. It is also making a longer-term effort to restore the independence of the judiciary and restructure the armed forces. Other long-standing human rights problems, such as police brutality and overcrowded and unsanitary prisons, are also beginning to be addressed.   A Fujimori legacy that the government so far has not tackled is the country's draconian and much criticized anti-terrorism legislation. Nor has it yet remedied the situation of some 2,500 prisoners convicted by anti-terrorism courts without due process or the right to a defense.   Accountability for crimes committed under Fujimori and Montesinos    Special prosecutors attached to the Ministry of Justice are now investigating a wide universe of crimes committed under the Fujimori government, including corruption, drug-trafficking, and human rights abuses. The latter include both abuses committed in the context of Peru's counter-insurgency war and those that have been attributed directly to Fujimori, Montesinos, and their political and military cronies. Montesinos is currently in detention in the naval base of Callao, and at least fifteen generals are in jail or under house arrest, including a former army commander-in-chief, Gen. Nicolás de Bari Hermoza Ríos, who is charged in connection with the 1991 Barrios Altos massacre. They are among forty-three military officers who currently face criminal prosecution. Also charged are nineteen members of the """"Colina Group,"""" a death squad set up by Montesinos in the early 1990s to secretly eliminate key terrorist suspects, which also harassed and intimidated independent journalists and opposition politicians. Ten former alleged Colina Group members are in detention or under house arrest.   The arrest and prosecution of these former officials is consistent with a ruling by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that found that the sweeping amnesty law passed by the Fujimori-controlled Congress in 1995 violated the American Convention on Human Rights. The military justice authorities have already barred the application of the amnesty to two massacres in which the Colina Group was involved, the 1991 Barrios Altos case and the 1992 La Cantuta case.   The criminal prosecution of former President Fujimori is also proceeding apace. The Peruvian Congress stripped Fujimori of his immunity as former head of state last year and, in September 2001, the attorney general filed charges against him in two massacres (the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta cases). Fujimori, now resident in Japan, also faces prosecution for giving Montesinos a severance payment of $15 million for """"services to the nation."""" Arrest warrants have been forwarded to Interpol in both cases, and Peru is expected soon to formally request Japan to extradite Fujimori.   Truth commission    In parallel with prosecutorial efforts, Peru has formed a Commission of Truth and Reconciliation to investigate and document the political violence and counterinsurgency abuses that took place between 1980 and 2000. The commission is expected to present a written report to the government in February 2003. It will shortly begin a series of public hearings in rural areas affected by the armed conflict.   Justice and prison reform    Progress toward reforming Peru's judiciary, crippled by years of corruption and neglect, has been slow. Several judges from the Fujimori era, as well as a former attorney general, are facing criminal proceedings. As in many Latin American countries, the justice sector as a whole is underfunded. To combat corruption and attract better-qualified members, the government has increased the pay of judges. It is trying to speed up the training and appointment of tenured incumbents to replace provisional judges who are still numerous, particularly in rural areas.   Prison conditions remain harsh, with severe overcrowding and unsanitary conditions in some prisons. Yet there have been some improvements since the end of the Fujimori government. Prisoners convicted of terrorism, who previously were kept locked in their cells all day and were allowed few visits, are now held under the same conditions as other prisoners.   Draconian anti-terrorism laws, unfair trials, and innocents in prisons    Peru is currently holding about 2,500 prisoners convicted of or indicted on charges of terrorism or treason. Many were tried by anti-terrorism courts, civil and military, whose judges were often hooded to prevent their identification, in speedy court proceedings in which the right to a defense was severely restricted. (These """"faceless"""" courts were abolished in October 1997.) The laws under which prisoners were charged, introduced by decree after Fujimori's """"self-coup"""" in 1992, are vaguely worded and allow courts to send people to prison for long periods for ill-defined offenses such as """"affecting international relations,"""" """"provoking anxiety"""" or justifying terrorism (apología del terrorismo).   Fujimori acknowledged that the antiterrorist courts had convicted hundreds of innocent people, and he set up an ad-hoc committee to recommend cases for a presidential pardon. Since Fujimori left office in November 2000, the recommendations of a Justice Ministry committee, which inherited the work of the ad-hoc committee, have resulted in the release of more than two hundred wrongly convicted prisoners. But at least eighty cases forwarded to the committee by human rights groups and the Church have yet to be considered.   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights has ruled that Peru should grant a new trial to four Chileans sentenced to life imprisonment for treason as alleged members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru, MRTA) guerrilla group. The new civilian prosecution is currently at the pretrial stage. Lori Berenson, an American citizen convicted of treason in a military court in 1996, was also recently retried in a civilian court. (Human Rights Watch will be releasing a separate backgrounder on this case.) No measures, however, have been proposed to deal with the demands for a retrial of the remaining prisoners convicted under the same laws, scores of whom were recently on a nation-wide hunger strike. These prisoners also have a right to a fair trial.   Human Rights Watch believes that the government should ensure that such prisoners are retried in impartial civilian courts with rights to due process of law. Defendants must have adequate access to counsel in private; counsel must enjoy access to evidence equal to prosecutors; evidence obtained under duress must be held inadmissible, and convictions must be based on precisely defined and recognizably criminal offenses.   Nor have Peru's politicians moved to amend the draconian anti-terrorism legislation inherited from Fujimori. Yet, in what may be a step in the direction of reform, anti-terrorism judges now claim to interpret the laws in such a way as to avoid the widespread abuses of the past.","Americas, Peru","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture, Detention without Trial"

Box 281  Khartoum  Sudan   Your Excellency,   We are writing to express concern about the detention of Hassan al Turabi, the leader of the opposition Popular National Congress (PNC), who has been detained without trial for one year. We are also concerned about the detention without charges of at least ten other members of the PNC.   Dr. Turabi was arrested on February 21, 2001, on charges of undermining the constitution and waging war against the state, after he signed a memorandum of understanding with the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). The memo stated that the agreed objectives (working jointly to resolve the crisis and establish a democratic system) would be pursued through peaceful means of popular resistance against the government's authoritarian methods. Two days later, the government brought charges against Dr. Turabi under section 31(1) of the National Security Act 1999, as amended, relating to undermining the constitution and waging war against the state. These articles carry the death penalty under Sudanese law. No trial date was set.   On October 21, 2001, the Constitutional Court granted a defense motion to dismiss the charges. In a highly irregular move, Dr. Turabi was re-arrested by the internal security agency (Jihaz Al Am'n Al Da'khili) immediately before he was physically out of its custody. The agency claimed that he was again arrested under section 31(1) of the National Security Act-although these charges against him had just been dropped by order of the Constitutional Court.   In January 2002, Dr. Turabi's attorneys submitted a new motion to the Constitutional Court for his release on the grounds that that the maximum time that someone can be detained under section 31(1) of the National Security Act-three months and three days-has lapsed. That motion is still pending.   The defense team also noted to Human Rights Watch that the internal security agency had followed none of the procedures under the National Security Act to detain Dr. Turabi this second time, including that there be a recommendation in writing from the internal security agency to the security agency council (composed of security personnel) to extend his period of detention, on a monthly basis, up to the maximum period of three months and three days.   The head of the internal security agency answered this January 2002 motion to release Dr. Turabi in a letter to the court stating that Dr. Turabi was actually detained under section 31(2) of the National Security Act-which allows for up to nine months in security detention before charges must be brought. Section 31 (2) applies to robbery and """"ethnic sedition,"""" apparently a reference to the memorandum Dr. Turabi had signed with the SPLA. The defense attorneys received the internal security letter from the acting president of the Constitutional Court. They replied that section 31 (2) was inapplicable because Dr. Turabi was not in a position to commit robbery since he was jailed one year ago, and that the memorandum with the SPLA does not fit the category of """"ethnic sedition"""" because it is a memo between political parties of different religions, ethnicities, and races, agreeing to act together.   While the first charges against Dr. Turabi were still before the court, President Omar El Bashir said that Dr. Turabi would never be released unless he denounced the SPLA memo he had signed.   Dr. Turabi remains under arrest in a government house. After charges were filed against him in February 2001, he was held in Kober Prison in Khartoum North, where he had rights to receive visitors and where he could confer with his associates, who were also in jail from time to time. In the government house where he has been since May 2001, he may not leave the house and only his wife may visit him. This quasi-isolation seems designed to prevent him from political activity.   The handling of this case, the actions of the internal security agency, and the statement by the president of Sudan raise serious concerns about respect for human rights and the rule of law in Sudan. It is alarming that even a politician as prominent as Dr. Turabi, who has held high government office with the president and has been politically active for more than three decades, may be subjected to prolonged detention without trial, with no opportunity to disprove the charges against him in open court.   Members of the PNC have been arbitrarily detained on a repeated basis by government internal security forces as a result of exercising their rights to free expression, association, and assembly. On October 2, 2001, twenty-eight PNC members were detained while attempting to hold a news conference at their headquarters. On October 21, 2001, five more members of the PNC were arrested in Khartoum. Based on the most recent reliable reports, ten members of the PNC remain in detention without charges, five of them in Kober prison. The ten are Adam al Tahir Hamdoun, Ibrahim Abdel Hafiz, Tariq Mahgoub, Suliman Gamous, Haj Majid Suwarr, Unwar Jubarra, Osman Abdulla, AlAmin AbdulRuzak, Nourildeen Adam Ali, and Zuhair Hamid Suliman   Members of other political parties, such as the Communist Party of Sudan, are also repeatedly subjected to arbitrary treatment by internal security and detained, often without charge, for months and years at a time.   Human Rights Watch condemns the detention of persons for the peaceful exercise of fundamental political rights as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Sudan is a party.   Human Rights Watch urges you to guarantee rights accorded to these individuals under international covenants and under Sudanese legislation, including 1999 legislation allowing for the operation of political parties. We urge that these detainees be accorded a fair trial under international and Sudanese law or that they be released immediately.   Sincerely,    Jemera Rone  Sudan researcher","Africa, Sudan",""

The Indonesian government in general and Komnas-HAM in particular have failed dismally to investigate serious human rights abuses in Aceh,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"And Komnas-HAM has gone from being the most credible institution in the country to being a real hindrance to human rights progress.""""  The 44-page report, """"Accountability for Human Rights Violations in Aceh,"""" focuses on the killings of thirty men and a two-year-old child in August 2001 on a rubber and palm oil plantation in Julok, East Aceh. The victims were all ethnic Acehnese; they were lined up and executed by a group of armed men in camouflage uniforms. The Indonesian army and police accused the rebel Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM) of responsibility; GAM insisted that the killers were members of the Indonesian security forces.  The new report includes excerpts from an internal report of a Komnas-HAM """"observation"""" visit to East Aceh two weeks later. The report includes transcripts, which Human Rights Watch has translated in full, of taped interviews between two commissioners of Komnas-HAM and eyewitnesses to the killings.  Virtually all witnesses asserted that the Indonesian army was responsible, although they could not name individual perpetrators. The Komnas-HAM team, however, failed to follow up important leads. The two senior Komnas-HAM representatives on the team allowed military officers to accompany them on some interviews, a clear inhibition to free discussion. After their return to Jakarta, the commissioners sat on their findings for five months. Only on January 8, 2002 did Komnas-HAM agree to set up a formal commission of inquiry, but more than two months later, no progress was evident.  Human Rights Watch said that establishing accountability for human rights abuses in Aceh, and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice, are essential if the decades-long conflict there is to be resolved.  """"When not just the security forces and the executive branch of government - but even the national human rights commission - fail to give sufficient priority to ensuring justice is done for so grave a crime, the prospects for ending the violence seem dim indeed,"""" said Jones.  In the report, Human Rights Watch calls on the government of Indonesia to give the highest priority to ensuring that the perpetrators of the August 2001 massacre are identified and brought to justice. It calls on the Indonesian parliament to hold hearings into why so many serious human rights violations in Aceh remain unsolved, the perpetrators not only unpunished but unidentified. The parliament should examine the role of the police and security forces, the justice system, and Komnas-HAM.  They should also make recommendations for strengthening mechanisms for investigating allegations of human rights violations to ensure that those whose rights are violated have prompt and effective access to judicial or other remedies. Finally, it calls on donors, both private and governmental, who have funded Komnas-HAM in the past, to jointly fund a thorough and impartial external evaluation of Komnas-HAM's work and approach to human rights over the last two years, and ensure that the findings of the evaluation are made public, in English and Bahasa Indonesia","Asia, Indonesia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/15/conditions-slavery-sudans-civil-war","Conditions of Slavery in Sudans Civil War","Conditions of Slavery in Sudan's Civil War","Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","03/15/2002","Human Rights Watch has long denounced slavery in Sudan in the context of the nineteen-year civil war. In this contemporary form of slavery government-backed and armed militia of the Baggara tribes raid to capture children and women who are then held in conditions of slavery in western Sudan and elsewhere. They are forced to work for free in homes and in fields, punished when they refuse, and abused physically and sometimes sexually. Raids are directed mostly at the civilian Dinka population of the southern region of Bahr El Ghazal. The government arms and sanctions the practice of slavery by this tribal militia, known as muraheleen, as a low cost part of its counterinsurgency war against the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), which is identified with the Dinka tribe of southern Sudan. Human Rights Watch has called on the government of Sudan to take firm measures to stamp out slavery and prosecute those responsible for it, including law enforcement officers who fail to assist the victims and their families who are searching for them. The victims' families have consistently complained that local government officials, including police, have rarely helped them when they have traveled to western Sudan in an attempt to locate and free their abducted children. Thus the government of Sudan is responsible not only of knowingly arming, transporting and assisting the slave-raiding militia, it also is responsible for not enforcing its own laws against kidnapping, assault, and forced labor. There is no prohibition in the Sudan Criminal Code of 1991 against slavery, though Sudan has ratified the Slavery Convention, the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, and is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as well as other international treaties outlawing slavery.  GOVERNMENT ACTIONS The government of Sudan has stonewalled on the issue of slavery, claiming it was a matter of rival tribes engaging in hostage taking, over which it had little control. That is simply untrue, as myriad reports coming out of southern Sudan have made abundantly clear. In 1999, the minister of justice by decree established the Committee for the Eradication of Abduction of Women and Children (CEAWC), an effort that UNICEF (the United Nations children’s agency), and several embassies and nongovernmental organizations supported financially. Human Rights Watch was invited to attend one of the initial workshops, held by CEAWC in Khartoum in July 1999. Victims’ communities were poorly represented there, and the communities of those implicated in abductions, forced labor, and slavery (a word the Sudan government assiduously avoids) were over-represented. Nevertheless, there did appear to be a willingness to move forward by retrieving women and children who had been abducted and were held in government territory. In order to do this, CEAWC incorporated the pre-existing Dinka Committee and its principal activist, James Agware (see below). In 1999, on the eve of the arrival in Sudan of the U.N.'s special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Sudan, the government announced that it would prosecute abductors and urged the population to report cases of slavery. No one was prosecuted. Again in 2001 the government announced it would prosecute those involved in abductions and forced labor. So far no one has been brought to trial. In November 2001 the minister of justice announced the creation of special tribunals to try those charged with abduction. In December 2001 the government announced that the official in charge of CEAWC would report directly to the president of Sudan. In January 2002 the government agreed with the U.S. special envoy for peace in Sudan, Sen. John Danforth, to allow an international commission to study incidents of slavery and forced labor, and to make recommendations on practical steps to end these practices. The establishment of the international commission is pending, although the U.S. government suspended its talks with the Sudan government after a government helicopter attack in February 2002 that killed at least seventeen southern civilians at a government-approved food distribution site in Western Upper Nile.   DINKA RETRIEVAL OF SLAVES Since some time in the mid-1980s, a Dinka Committee, appointed by Dinka elders living in Khartoum, functioned intermittently to retrieve women and children held in slavery in Darfur, in the area of the Rizeigat tribe of the Baggara. That effort, headed by James Agware, a Dinka familiar with Darfur, was somewhat successful in that several hundred slaves were identified and released by their “owners.” James Agware and his associates visited the area and, through existing Dinka and other networks, identified abducted children of Dinka origin who were forced to work for Baggara families. Although the Dinka Committee never had steady financing, it managed to effect the release of several hundred persons from slavery conditions in Darfur, through talks with local authorities and chiefs. Those whose families could not be located were taken to Khartoum for care by the Dinka community there, and often placed in school. The families residing in the southern region of Bahr El Ghazal (a rebel-held area), through middlemen or directly, have long been paying the “owners” to secure the freedom of abducted relatives—when they could locate the abductees. At times, committees consisting of Dinka chiefs and elders from Bahr El Ghazal have traveled to Darfur and Kordofan to make formal approaches to Baggara chiefs, appealing to them to free the abductees or to assist the chiefs in locating them. Some of these efforts have borne fruit, and some have not. There are those among the Baggara and local officials (usually from the Dinka or Nuba tribes) who cooperate with the families when asked. They are not in the majority, however. As a result, these self-help measures have been excruciatingly piecemeal. FOREIGN “REDEMPTION” OR BUY-BACK OF SLAVES Since 1995, several groups of non-Sudanese Christians have endeavored to assist the Dinka in Bahr El Ghazal to “redeem”—or purchase the freedom of—their abducted children and female relatives. Without doubt, the families of the abductees and their chiefs welcome the assistance they receive from outside groups to make payments to buy the freedom of the slaves. They put the welfare of the individual children and women first, regardless of larger policy considerations raised by concerned agencies and individuals. This is entirely understandable: those relatives and chiefs whom Human Rights Watch has interviewed have stressed that this outside assistance enables them to free larger numbers of slaves than they were able to do on a piecemeal basis before. Some families have complained, however, that the foreigners drive up the market price of slaves for families searching on their own for their missing relatives and obliged to pay for their freedom. However, the problem of slavery in Sudan is a complex one; it cannot be ended solely by efforts to “redeem” or buy back slaves. In a joint statement by the Sudan Council of Churches (SCC) and the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC), issued in Geneva in July 1999, the two main bodies representing Christians in Sudan, both Catholic and Protestant, said: § The issue of slavery should be looked at in the context of the crisis in Sudan. § When the crises in Sudan are brought to an end, slavery will also come to an end. § Partners should support the efforts of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to end slavery in Sudan. § With all the good intentions in slave redemption, it does not end slavery. In or about May 2000, SPLA Commander-in-Chief John Garang wrote the foreign groups engaged in slavery buy-backs to demand that they channel all their activities through the SPLA’s relief wing, the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA). Prior to that time, the foreign groups had used the services of various Sudanese in the diaspora to facilitate their “redemption” trips. Specifically, the SPLA forbade them from using the services of four named southern Sudanese. In August 2000, Human Rights Watch brought its concerns about potential fraud and misuse of the redemption process to the attention of a high official of the SPLA. He said that the SPLA was developing guidelines with regard to the process of buying slaves’ freedom. So far no such guidelines have appeared. CRITIQUES OF SLAVERY “REDEMPTIONS” OR BUY-BACKS BY FOREIGNERS Initially it appeared that there were several problems with “redemption”: that this practice fueled the slave trade and that the organizations were effectively participating in the buying and selling of human beings. Knowledge that there are foreigners with deep pockets willing to pay to redeem slaves could spur on unscrupulous individuals to make a business out of “redemption.” These individuals, it was thought, would be among the Baggara. When the raiding and slave-taking practice started in its present form in the mid-1980s, it seemed that the primary motivation of the Baggara raiders, in addition to weakening the Dinka population, was to acquire cattle, with slavery a secondary consideration. The availability of foreign funds posed the risk that those who already conducted the slaving raids on Dinka villages would increasingly see abduction as their primary source of wealth from raiding children and women expressly to sell their freedom. A monetary incentive for slave raiding could also work against local agreements between Baggara and Dinka. Periodically the Baggara had agreed with the Dinka to halt raiding in exchange for access for Baggara cattle to Dinka pastures and rivers during the dry season. The government had often tried to thwart these agreements to preserve raiding as a counterinsurgency tool, by threatening the Baggara. Providing the raiders with additional material incentives to raid could undercut Baggara-Dinka peace efforts. It has not been possible to date to ascertain whether the monetary incentive produced more raiding in practice. There are several reasons: a rise in raiding may have been prevented. In 1999, the SPLA began to provide automatic weapons to local youth guarding the cattle, so that they could defend themselves and their cattle, while the SPLA also reportedly moved some troops into the affected area. There were a few clashes between the newly armed Dinka herders and the Baggara, with fatalities on both sides. This reduced the ease of raiding that the Baggara had enjoyed until then; in previous raids, the Baggara had avoided places where the SPLA might be found. They did not seek to attack soldiers: Baggara efforts were aimed at unprotected populations. U.N. personnel reported unofficially that the numbers of raids in 2000 had declined from the prior year. Another reason why it has been impossible to gauge the impact of “redemption” by outsiders is that there has been no systematic record keeping of the numbers of people captured during these raids. There has been virtually no systematic record keeping of any kind in this part of Sudan since the war began, and only sporadic records were kept before then. Literacy levels are is quite low and frequent displacement wreaks havoc with attempts at preserving records. Populations fleeing displacement, famine, raiders, and drought are often not able to preserve either records or the means to keep them. But another difficulty in gauging the impact of “redemption” by outsiders is the risk of fraud in buying slaves’ freedom. Outside groups have been operated without reference to lists of missing children and women, with middlemen securing releases of the slaves without their having verified that there was a family member seeking them. This gave rise to the risk of fraud: for instance, unscrupulous middlemen might """"borrow"""" or “rent” children who had never been abducted, for the purpose of enlarging a group of slaves (and thus increasing the proceeds from the purchase of their freedom). Many voiced concern about the potential for such fraud in this entirely unregulated environment. A private nonprofit research project is now underway to conduct a survey of eyewitnesses to raids and abductions, victims who have escaped, family members of victims, chiefs, and other local authorities. This survey is intended to produce a registry, by name and description, and date and place of raid, of those who have been captured in northern Bahr El Ghazal since the resurgence of slavery in the mid-1980s. This survey should provide the reliable statistical data which is lacking at this time, and thus assist in ensuring that those “redeemed” are genuinely abducted slaves. During early 1999, word of another type of fraud began to surface and circulate in exile and expatriate communities in Nairobi and elsewhere: fraud conducted by local Dinka authorities, including SPLA authorities. Most southerners aware of this said the same thing: slavery and “redemption” had become “a business” for the rebel group. Investigations by journalists with the Washington Post and the Irish Times have now confirmed these reports with eyewitness testimony confirming that some transactions for the freeing of slaves were effected not through Arab middlemen but through SPLA soldiers posing as Arab middlemen. Press reports cite SPLA officials admitting that some of the children whose freedom was purchased were not slaves, and that at least one “middleman” was an SPLA officer in disguise. The SPLA official spokesperson said that the SPLA made quite a large sum of money from currency conversion alone. Human Rights Watch opposes foreign-organized or funded buy-backs or purchases of freedom for slaves in southern Sudan, because of the factors set forth above. The SPLM/A and other local authorities involved in this aspect of the slave trade should be held accountable for their actions. De facto authorities in the south should instruct military and civilian personnel in their territory that they should have no further involvement in any slavery “redemption,” buy-back, or related transaction. The SPLM/A should also make a full accounting for the use of the funds acquired through the buy-back process, including profits earned on the exchange of U.S. dollars for Sudanese pounds (later dinars). They should turn these proceeds over to a fund to be established under the supervision of a responsible international agency or trust for the use of persons who have been enslaved. There is great need for an effective Sudanese and international program to stop abductions and return those abducted into slavery to their families. Human Rights Watch urges those concerned, including agencies that have until now not had a role in the process, to address the humanitarian needs of those who were enslaved and then escaped or were freed. We further urge that UNICEF and others devise approaches that will free all those still in conditions of slavery and that will enable them to be reunited with their families. We urge that the agencies such as UNICEF, the government of Sudan’s CEAWC and relevant state and military authorities, and international and national nongovernmental organizations working for the benefit of the enslaved institute mechanisms to prevent slavery and fraud as much as possible. The focus must remain on the victims, however, which requires stepped-up international action—not just to end the war but also to end slavery in Sudan now by government of Sudan action. The government must firmly prosecute and sentence to appropriate prison terms those who have been involved in the abduction, kidnapping, sale, or exchange of Dinka. It should also disarm the Baggara who have been involved in the raids, and disband the Popular Defense Force units they comprise. (See “HRW Background Paper on Slavery and Slavery Redemption in the Sudan,” March 1999) Only such firm government measures can stop raiding. The government of Sudan must also investigate and cooperate completely with search and other agencies to locate and release, without payment, those who have been abducted and enslaved and held in slavery throughout the government-controlled areas of Sudan. Postponing measures to tackle this problem until the end of the war may mean that thousands more are taken captive while the parties remain militarily and politically stalemated.

The tragedy has focused attention on the role of the religious police as well as the state agency responsible for the education of girls and women in the kingdom Eyewitnesses, including civil defense officers, reported that several members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (mutawwa'in, in Arabic) interfered with rescue efforts because the fleeing students were not wearing the obligatory public attire (long black cloaks and head coverings) for Saudi girls and women. The mutawwa'in, a law-enforcement agency that has sought to ensure the application of the kingdom's strict gender segregation and dress code for women, has drawn criticism for abusive practices including harassment, physical abuse, and arbitrary arrest. """"Women and girls may have died unnecessarily because of extreme interpretations of the Islamic dress code,"""" said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"State authorities with direct and indirect responsibility for this tragedy must be held accountable.""""  There were 835 students and fifty-five women teachers in Intermediate School No. 31 when the blaze started at about 8:00 in the morning, according to Saudi press reports. Saudi newspapers suggested that the school, located in a rented building, was overcrowded, and may have lacked proper safety infrastructure and equipment, such as fire stairs and alarms.  The government's investigation should also examine unsafe conditions at the school, which is administered by the General Presidency for Girls' Education (GPGE), Human Rights Watch added.  Yesterday's edition of Arab News (Jeddah) cited a report prepared by Mecca's Civil Defense Department about the rescue effort at the school. The report noted that mutawwa'in were at the school's main gate and, """"intentionally obstructed the efforts to evacuate the girls. This resulted in the increased number of casualties."""" The religious police reportedly tried to block the entry of Civil Defense officers into the building. """"We told them that the situation was dangerous and it was not the time to discuss religious issues, but they refused and started shouting at us,"""" Arab News quoted Civil Defense officers as saying.  """"Whenever the girls got out through the main gate, these people forced them to return via another. Instead of extending a helping hand for the rescue work, they were using their hands to beat us,"""" Civil Defense officers were quoted as saying. The officers also said they saw three people beating girls who had evacuated the school without proper dress. A Saudi journalist told Human Rights Watch that the mutawwa'in at the scene also turned away parents and other residents who came to assist.  The tragedy has prompted Saudi journalists to call for greater openness on the part of the GPGE in response to inquiries from the media for information about its policies and practices. All aspects of state-financed education for girls in Saudi Arabia, including the renting of buildings for schools, is under the authority of the GPGE, an autonomous government agency long controlled by conservative clerics. """"A free flow of information would. . . help the press to prepare an investigative report on other schools in the Kingdom where conditions might also endanger the lives of students and teachers,"""" Deputy Editor-in-Chief Jamal A. Khashoggi wrote in yesterday's Arab News.  He urged that the GPGE provide information about fire safety in its schools for girls, including the number of fire extinguishers, the frequency of fire drills, as well as details about the contracts for the thousands of rented school premises in the kingdom, including provisions for installation of emergency exits and fire alarms.  The kingdom's intermediate public schools, which are segregated by gender, provide three years of education for children between the ages of twelve and fifteen, following a six-year program of elementary education.  Saudi Arabia is a state party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Discrimination against Women.

The public health, social, and economic consequences of the use and sale of cocaine in any form, and crack cocaine in particular, warrant public concern. But they do not justify penal sanctions that are disproportionately harsh and racially discriminatory. They do not justify prison sentences that violate common sense, basic principles of criminal justice, and internationally affirmed human rights. In 1995, the Commission urged an equalization of sentences for federal crack and cocaine offenders, realizing crack sentences were unfairly severe and long crack sentences were imposed primarily on minority defendants. Unfortunately, Congress failed to heed its wise counsel. Today, the Commission has another opportunity to remind the country that sentences for crack offenders must be changed. We hope this time Congress will listen. We urge the Commission to restore proportionality to federal cocaine sentences and to reduce their racially disparate impact by:  1)    Amending the guidelines to lower sentences for low-level crack offenses; 2)    Amending the guidelines to reduce disparities in the sentencing of crack and powder offenses; 3)    Urging Congress to eliminate or dramatically modify the mandatory minimums for crack and powder cocaine. I. Background Federal crack offenders face sentences that are uniquely severe compared to other federal drug offenders, drug offenders sentenced under state law and drug offenders convicted in other constitutional democracies. The Commission's statistics reveal that the average federal sentence in 2000 for a street-level dealer of crack is 103.5 months, while the average sentence for a powder cocaine dealer is 55.6 months. The average maximum sentence for persons convicted of drug trafficking felonies under state law in 1998 was 54.5 months. title="""""""">1 Among European countries, the average length of sentences for persons convicted of drug trafficking was 33 months.2  The current sentencing structure for cocaine offenses reflects Congressional choices made in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. Congress established five- and ten-year mandatory minimums triggered by specific minimum quantities of cocaine. In what has come to be known as the 100-to-1 quantity ratio, it takes one hundred times as much powder cocaine as crack cocaine. Congress also doubled these mandatory minimums for people with a prior felony conviction. The Sentencing Commission used those drug quantity levelsÑand the 100-to-1 ratioÑto develop sentencing guidelines for the full range of other powder and crack cocaine offenses.  In 1988 Congress also made crack cocaine the only substance the simple possession of which triggered a mandatory prison sentence.  Under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, simple possession of more than 5 grams of crackÑan amount that would translate into somewhere between ten and fifty individual doses of crackÑis punishable by a minimum of five years in prison. In contrast, simple possession of any quantity of powder cocaine by first time offenders is a misdemeanor punishable by no more than one year in prison. Supporters of the remarkably harsh sentences for crack offenders insist that crack poses uniquely serious harms compared to other drugs and that long prison sentences are needed to put major traffickers behind bars, offer prosecutors leverage for securing cooperation from offenders, deter prospective offenders, and enhance community safety and well being. Opponents point to an abundance of empirical data showing that the inherent dangers of crack are not dramatically different from those of powder cocaine, and that harsh federal sentences have had little impact on the demand for or the availability of the drug.  Instead, the federal sentencing structure has resulted in the incarceration of thousands of low-level offenders, excessively severe sentences for such offenders, marked racial disparities in prison sentences, a staggering growth in federal prison populations, and a waste of public resources.   We believe the facts support the critics. Indeed, the data and arguments marshaled by the Commission in its 1995 report remains the most cogent and powerful case against higher sentences for crack offenders created by the 100-to-1 differential. name=""""_ftnref3"""">3 The Commission correctly concluded that there is no empirical or principled basis for subjecting offenders who deal in or possess crack to dramatically higher sentences than offenders who deal in or possess powder cocaine.  II.  International Human Rights and Sentencing International human rights limit a government's exercise of its coercive and penal powers. Those rights are affirmed in the Universal Declaration of Human RightsÑthe magna carta of international human rightsÑand fleshed out in several subsequent treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD).4 The United States is a party to all of these treaties.5  Under the Supremacy Clause in Article VI of the U.S. Constitution, these treaties are part of the Òsupreme law of the landÓ and as such are binding on all public officialsÑincluding members of the Sentencing Commission.  These treaties are not self-executing, and in the absence of implementing legislation, U.S. residents cannot turn to the courts to defend rights acknowledged by the treaties. But officials nonetheless remain obliged to respect those rights as they exercise their public responsibilities. 1. The principle that punishments should not exceed that which is proportionate to the crime reflects three basic human rights precepts: the inherent dignity of the individual, the right to be free of cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, and the right to liberty:   The inherent dignity of all persons is the rock upon which international human rights are built. As the preamble to the ICCPR states, Òthe equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human familyÉderive from the inherent dignity of the human personÉÓ Respect for the intrinsic value of the human person imposes fundamental limits on the nature and quantity of punishment. A criminal conviction is not a license for the imposition of arbitrarily severe punishment.  The ICCPR and the Convention against Torture prohibit Òcruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.Ó Excessive punishment falls within this proscription.  Imprisonment becomes cruel, inhuman, or degrading if its severity (i.e., length) is greatly disproportionate to the crime for which it has been imposed.  The right to liberty also limits the length of sentences. By analogy to U.S. constitutional law, international human rights law requires not just procedural due process, but substantive due process as well.  That is, even if all requisite legal procedures have been followed, any deprivation of liberty must nonetheless still conform to principles of equity and justice.   2.  The right to be free of racial or ethnic discrimination is firmly embedded in international human rights law. The ICCPR and CERD prohibit unjustified discriminatory practices even if they have been adopted to secure otherwise valid social objectives such as reducing the sale of illicit drugs. III. Proportionality and Federal Crack Sentences  Prison is an extremely serious punishmentÑthe most coercive and drastic sanction that can be lawfully imposed short of capital punishment.6  Ensuring that prison sentences are proportionate is consequently a particularly important human rights obligation. To be proportionate, a prison sentence: 1) should not exceed the gravity of the offender's specific conduct and his or her personal responsibility and culpability; 2) should be tailored to the conduct of the individual defendant and not reflect penalties for crimes or offensive conduct that offender did not in fact commit. Federal sentences for crack offenders fail to meet these requirements. 1. Harsh sentences disproportionate to offender's conduct  The average prison sentence for crack cocaine offenders is ten years. The Commission's statistics reveal the average sentence in 2000 for a street-level dealer of crack is 103.5 monthsÑalmost nine years; a courier's average sentence is even greater, 107.4 months; the average sentence of a body guard, cook, or steerer is 117 monthsÑalmost ten years.7  Eighty-five percent of these sentences are served. By way of comparison, the mean maximum state prison sentence is one hundred months for all violent offenses. The estimated time served in state prison for violent offenses is fifty-four months. For burglary, the mean maximum state sentence is fifty-two months, and the estimated time to be served is twenty-four months.  name=""""_ftnref8"""">8 As another point of comparison, in Europe the mean prison sentence for homicide is ninety-nine months, for rape sixty-two months and for robbery forty-one months.  name=""""_ftnref9"""">9 We are aware of no empirical basis for punishing low-level crack offenses (e.g., the sale of crack to an adult purchaser) with prison sentences that are commensurate with, much less exceed, most crimes of violence.  While dramatic hyperbole abounds in public pronouncements about illicit drugs, a sober, impartial assessment of drug sentences in light of the principles of proportionality indicates such high federal sentences for crack offenders cannot be justified. Generally, a severe punishment is appropriate for conduct that seriously harms, or at least has threatened to harm, important legally protected interests or rights and conduct to which the victim has not consented.  So a significant prison term as a sanction for murder seems appropriate.  But in the case of retail drug transactions between adults or other low-level drug crimes, the nature and extent of the harm caused by an individual low-level drug offender is surprisingly difficult to identify:  The sale of drugs to an adult does not violate a legally protected right of that adult in the way that robbery of his property or assault on his person violates his rights. We are aware of no other significant prison sentences imposed in the U.S. for participating in transactions that do not deprive a person of legally protected interests and that were engaged in knowingly and voluntarily.  The repeated, extensive consumption of cocaineÑcrack as well as powderÑis harmful physically and psychologically.  But we are aware of no scientific data that shows every use of cocaine causes serious harm, or that all or even most adults who use cocaine cause substantial physical or psychological injury to themselves. Indeed, only about 10 percent of those who use cocaine ever become addicts. Even if each sales transaction is assumed to cause some amount of physiological or psychological harm, it is hard to discern the principled basis for punishing that conduct as though it were the equivalent of inflicting more serious harm by force upon an unconsenting adult.   There is deep public concern about the moral injury caused by drug consumption. President Bush commented recently that drugs rob men and women of dignity and character, that they are the enemy of ambition and hope. title="""""""">10 We do not believe, however, that the offense of contributing to these harms justifies years of imprisonment. If having a weak character or lacking ambition is not a crime, how can an act that contributes to such qualities be punished as a serious felony? The adverse social and public health consequences from the use and distribution of crack are the result of hundreds of thousands of individual actions.  The contribution of any individual low-level offender to these harms is necessarily negligible.  In determining the punishment that is proportional for the street-seller who engages in $20 crack sales, the harm he may have caused should not be conflated with the cumulative impact of countless other people. Severe prison sentences are disproportionate for individuals whose specific conduct in and of itself causes minimal harm, even if those same actions when undertaken by a sufficient number of other individuals results in accumulated public harm. name=""""_ftnref11"""">11 They would be proportionate, on the other hand, for drug kingpinsÑe.g., persons importing large amounts of cocaine into the country. 2. Harsher sentences for crack than powder cocaine not justified by conduct of crack offender    By virtue of the 100-to-1 differential, sentences for crack offenders are far higher than those powder cocaine offenders who engage in the equivalent conduct. The Commission's statistics indicate that the average sentence of a street-level dealer of crack cocaine is approximately double that of powder cocaine dealers, the same with a courier of crack compared to a courier of powder. The sentence for an importer or high-level supplier of crack is three times that of an importer of powder cocaine.  When Congress set mandatory minimum sentences for crack and powder, it had no empirical basis for creating the 100-to-1 ratio.  By all accounts, it simply picked the figure out of the air.  Certainly, it had relatively little information about crack and much of what it thought it knew was erroneous.  We are unaware of any reasoned basis today for retaining sentences for crack offenses that are so much higher than sentences for powder cocaine offenses. Certainly the difference cannot be justified by any differences inherent in the two substances. They are pharmacologically identical and have similar physiological effects, although the form of ingestion affects the rapidity of the onset of effects and their duration.12 The principle differences between the two forms of cocaineÑe.g., use by different socio-economic groups and the greater nuisance and violence accompanying crack distributionÑdo not reflect any inherent differences in the conduct of the individual crack offender.  Higher penalties for low-income offenders  The uniquely high sentences for crack offenders partially reflect Congress's concern about crack's use in low-income urban neighborhoods. Unlike powder cocaine, which is relatively expensive, crack is produced and sold in small ÒrocksÓ that can be bought in small, cheap quantities.  While people with financial resources can and do use powder cocaine as well as crack, people with limited funds who want to use cocaine can only afford it in the form of crack.  Crack's low price thus contributed to the rapid rise in its use in the 1980s. Tailoring an individual's punishment to drug pricing does not square with the principle of proportionality. We are troubled by a sentencing structure that as a practical matter keys the severity of a sentence to the affordability of a particular drug.  In essence, federal law penalizes the sale of a substance to poor people more than the sale of the equivalent substance to the affluent. It is the equivalent, were alcohol illegal, of imposing higher punishments on the sale of jug wine than on the sale of chateau neuf du pape. Similarly, by dictating far higher sentences for the possession of crack than for the possession of powder, the law penalizes more severely the poor who acquire the affordable form of a drug than the affluent who acquire the same drug in a more expensive form.   Punishment for violent offenses incorporated into sentences for nonviolent offenders The current federal sentencing structure is crafted as if all crack offenders are violent and powder cocaine offenders are not. There is no argument that the spread of crack was accompanied by serious violence as gangs fought for control of distribution channels in the new market.  During the 1980s, the number of homicides grew rapidly in inner cities, and included innocent bystanders among the victims. With the waning of the crack ÒepidemicÓ and the settling of distribution systems for crack, the levels of violence have greatly subsided. But even if it continued at previous rates, we do not believe crack offenders who have not engaged in violence should be given sentences set to reflect the violent conduct of others. As discussed above, the proportionality of a punishment must be judged with relation to the actual offense committed by the specific offender being sentenced.   The unfairness of incorporating violence into all crack cocaine sentences is underscored by Commission statistics that reveal that almost 80 percent of federal crack offenders had no weapon involvement in their crime in FY2000. Indeed, 74.5 percent did not even have access to a weapon, and only 2.3 percent brandished, used, or discharged a weapon in the course of committing their drug offense. Commission statistics on weapon involvement for the eight-year period 1992-2000, reveal that even in 1995, the year at which weapon involvement was highest, 70 percent of crack offenders had no weapon involvement.  In FY2000, violence was involved in only 6 percent of crack offender casesÑonly somewhat higher than the figure of 5.3 percent in powder cocaine cases. There was no bodily harm in 88.4 percent of crack cocaine casesÑagain, a figure roughly equivalent to that in power cocaine cases (91 percent). name=""""_ftnref13"""">13 We are not proposing that the Commission (or Congress) close their eyes to the violence that accompanies the distribution of drugs. Use of weapons to commit a drug offense can be considered an aggravating factor that enhances the punishment (although we would prefer that unlawful use or possession of a weapon be charged as a separate crime and proven beyond a reasonable doubt). But the baseline sentences currently set for given quantities of crack should be reduced so that every crack offender is not being sentenced as though he or she directly participated in unlawful violence.  3) Sentences never intended for low-level offenders  In 2000, Commissioner Steer pointed out that Congress had not intended to impose extremely severe prison sentences on low-level crack offenders. title="""""""">14 It believed that a major trafficker (e.g. manufacturer or head of organizations dealing in very large drug quantities) should receive at least a ten-year sentence and a serious trafficker (e.g. manager of substantial retain trade business) should receive at least a five-year sentence. It then specified drug quantities in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 that it thought were associated with the different roles in the drug business. Unfortunately, it got the numbers wrong. As the Commission's research has shown, the 5 grams of crack cocaine set by Congress as the trigger for a five-year sentence is not a quantity associated with mid-level or serious traffickers. According to the Commission's data, the median amount of crack cocaine associated with a manager or supervisor is 253 grams of crack.15 Similarly, the 50 grams of crack that triggers the ten-year mandatory minimum is a far cry from the median quantity of 2,962 associated with importers and high-level suppliers of crack cocaine.  Few of the men and women convicted of federal crack offenses are serious or major traffickers. According to Commission data, 77 percent are lower-level offenders: 66.5 percent are street-level dealers; the other 11 percent are lookouts, courtiers, bodyguards, and cooks. Another 5.9 percent are managers and supervisors.  Not surprisingly, given their function, the scope of geographic activity for these offenders is quite limited: three quarters of the crack cocaine offenders operated in their neighborhood or on a local level. In other words, less than one-fifth of crack cocaine offenders are the importers, organizers, manufacturers or wholesalers operating on the broad geographic scale on whom Congress intended to impose five- and ten-year mandatory minimums.  If we assume, arguendo, that those five- and ten-year sentences would have been proportionate for major organizers, then they are necessarily disproportionately severe for the lower-level offenders on whom they in fact fall.  4) The federal sentencing structure incapable of yielding proportionate sentences The federal drug sentencing structure combines mandatory minimum sentences by Congress and sentencing guidelines created by the Commission. By its nature, the structure precludes proportional sentences for crack offenders. Mandatory sentences applied to broad classes for criminal conduct can satisfy the principle of proportionality only if the prescribed punishment is proportional to the conduct of every individual falling within the class.  The mandatory minimum set by Congress for crack offenses clearly fails that test. Harsh penalties set simply by quantity and type of drug cannot distinguish between different levels of culpability, yet they block judicial efforts to tailor sentences to the individual offender. Under the sentencing scheme created by Congress, minute amounts of drugs can yield major differences in sentences for people who are otherwise similar in conduct and culpability. For example, an amount of .01 grams above 5 grams can mean an extreme of four years in the sentence for someone convicted of first offense simple possession. Mandatory minimums also lump people together of very different levels of culpability.  By setting sentences based solely on quantity, they fail to distinguish between different roles in the offense (e.g., peripheral participants or ringleader).  Street-level sellers can be charged with quantities that reflect the total of numerous sales. There have been many complaints that law enforcement agents deliberately wait to make arrests until the sales total has increased enough to trigger mandatory minimums.  The impact of the failure to key sentences to role is also magnified by conspiracy laws. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 made the mandatory minimum penalties applicable to drug offenses also applicable to conspiracies to commit those offenses. Low-level participants in a drug enterprise can be sentenced on the basis of drug quantities handled by the entire undertaking. Whether through accumulated sales or conspiracy laws, a street-level crack seller can face sentences far higher than his role otherwise warrants. The Commission has crafted sentencing guidelines with mitigating and aggravating factors that adjust the baseline sentence set by drug quantity to better reflect the individual's conduct, role, and culpability. The sentence, however, cannot be reduced below the term mandated by the mandatory minimum legislation. The mandatory minimums trump the Commission's sentencing guidelines. As Commissioner Steer pointed out in his statement before the House Governmental Reform Subcommittee on Criminal Justice in May, 2000:  [F]or the very offenders who, arguably, most warrant proportionally lower sentences (offenders who by guidelines' definitions are the least culpable), mandatory minimums generally operate to block the sentence reflecting mitigating factors. This means that these least culpable offenders may receive the same sentences as their relatively more culpable counterparts.16 Commission data indicates that in 60 percent of cases in which the defendant qualified for a mitigating role reduction under the guidelines, the mandatory minimum trumped the sentence. title="""""""">17  The safety valve provision enacted by Congress provides some relief for offenders otherwise facing mandatory sentences. Higher rates of arrest in the urban areas, in which most crack cocaine arrests are made, have left most crack defendants with criminal records that preclude them from qualifying for the safety valve. The congressional mandatory minimums have distorted the guidelines.  The Commission used the five- and ten-year sentences set by Congress with the corresponding drug quantities as the basic reference points around which it constructed its drug offense guidelines. We recognize and commend the Commission's effort to secure proportionate sentences for individual defendants through various mitigating factors. But the guideline structure cannot ensure proportionate sentences because it is reflected by the excessively severe sentences mandated by Congress.  5) Federal versus state prosecution  The low-level offenders who constitute the bulk of federal crack offenders could have been prosecuted under state lawsÑand most would have received lower sentences. In 1995, the Commission repeated that only fourteen states distinguish between crack and powder cocaine for sentencing purposes.18 The remaining states did not create statutory sentences distinguishing between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. Only one of the states, North Dakota, used a 100-to-1 quantity ratio for the threshold amounts triggering mandatory minimum penalties. We take no position on the appropriate role of the federal government with regard to counter narcotics activities and drug prosecutions. But it is extremely troubling from a proportionality perspective that the same activityÑe.g., selling rocks of crack to consumersÑcan get very different sentences simply based on whether local or federal prosecutors take the case. IV. The Racially Discriminatory Impact of Crack Sentences Available evidence indicates there are more white cocaine offenders than there are black. Yet the Commission's data shows that in 2000, over 84 percent of federal crack defendants were African American, a proportion that did not vary significantly throughout the 1990s.19 Blacks thus bear the brunt of the severe sentences uniquely meted out to crack offenders under the federal sentencing structure. As discussed above, we do not believe the far higher sentences for crack than powder cocaine offenses are justified.  The lack of justification takes on added significance in light of the dramatic racial disparities in the imposition of crack sentences.  An indefensible sentencing differential becomes unconscionable in light of its racial impact.  Challenges to the crack/powder sentencing differential on equal protection grounds under the U.S. or state constitutions have generally failed because of the absence of proof of discriminatory intent on the part of the lawmakers.  International human rights law, however, contains no requirement of discriminatory intent for a finding of racial discrimination.   CERD prohibits racial discrimination, which it defines as conduct that has the Òpurpose or effectÓ of restricting rights on the basis of race. href=""""#_ftn20"""" name=""""_ftnref20"""">20  Laws that are racially neutral on their face will violate CERD if they have an unjustifiable significant disparate impact upon a group distinguished by race even in the absence of racial animus.  CERD thus raises the question of whether the racially disparate impact of the crack sentences is warranted. We believe not.  The impact does not reflect racial differences in offending behavior. Rather, it reflects law enforcement practices, practices that, like the sentences themselves, cannot be divorced from underlying racial dynamics prejudicial to African Americans. 1. Crack offending by different racial groups Available data indicates there are far more white crack offenders than black, even though blacks constitute the great preponderance of persons prosecuted for federal crack offenses. Federal data indicates blacks have a somewhat higher rate of crack use than white.21 Given the much greater size of the white population, there are nonetheless still far more whites (2,870,000) who have ever usedÑand thus illegally possessedÑcrack cocaine than blacks (1,040,000).22  As for crack sellers, there is no national data on their racial breakdown.  The limited data on drug sellers that does exists nonetheless suggests whites constitute a preponderance of the cocaine selling population. For example, during the period 1991-1993 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) included questions about drug selling in the annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) surveys.  On average over the three-year period, blacks were 16 percent of the admitted sellers and whites were 82 percent. title="""""""">23 According to research on patterns of drug purchase and use in selected major cities, drug users reported that their main drug sources were sellers of the same racial or ethnic background as they were. A large study conducted in the Miami, Florida metropolitan area of powder and crack cocaine users revealed that over 96 percent of users in each ethnic/racial category were also involved in street-level drug dealingÑwhich would suggest a racial profile of sellers that is comparable to users.24  Most criminal justice analysts who have looked at racial disparities in drug offender arrests and imprisonment believe demographics and law enforcement resource allocation bear principal responsibility for the disparities. Illicit drug useÑand presumably salesÑare higher in large metropolitan areas where drug law enforcement is also concentrated.  Since more blacks, proportionately, live in these areas than whites, black drug offenders are at greater risk of arrest than white offenders. Within urban areas, the major ÒfrontsÓ in the war on drugs have been low-income minority neighborhoods.  In those neighborhoods, drug transactions are more likely to be conducted on the streets, in public, and between strangers, whereas in white neighborhoodsÑworking-class through upper-classÑdrugs are more likely to be sold indoors, in bars, clubs, and private homes and only to known buyers. Undercover operations, buy and busts, and other law enforcement activities are therefore easier and quicker to undertake in low-income neighborhoods and the likelihood of success much greater. The net result has been that people buying and selling crack and powder cocaine in more affluent neighborhoods are less likely to be arrested than people buying and selling those drugs in poor, primarily minority, urban communities.  But concentration of anti-drug efforts in low-income urban neighborhoods also reflected racial dynamics. Indeed, although crack was the least used of the major illicit drugs in the U.S.Ñand although more whites used illicit drugs than blacksÑthe Òwar on drugsÓ that began in the 1980s was targeted most notoriously at the possession and sale of crack by blacks.  Crack cocaine in black neighborhoods was a lightening rod for a complicated and deep-rooted set of racial, class, political, social, and moral dynamics that resulted in extensive law enforcement activities in those neighborhoodsÑas well as uniquely severe federal sentences for crack offenders. 2. The racial underpinnings of crack sentences We do not believe any honest observer of the public response to crack, including federal sentences, can ignore the role of race. Powder cocaine use by white Americans in all social classes increased in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  That use, however, did not engender the orgy of media and political attention that arose when smokable cocaine in the form of crack spread throughout low-income minority neighborhoods that were already seen as dangerous and threatening. There is no question that with the spread of crack, inner city minority neighborhoods suffered from the disorder, harassment, and nuisance that accompanied increased drug dealing on the streets, increased crimes by addicts seeking to finance their addiction and violence by competing drug gangs. But the dismay of local residents was far exceeded by the censure, outrage, and concern from outsiders fanned by incessant and sensationalist media stories, by politicians seeking electoral advantage by being Òtough on crime,Ó and by some politicians who were Ðconsciously or otherwiseÑplaying the Òrace cardÓ in advocating harsh responses to crack.  We recognize that many members of Congress and the public sincerely sought to help poor minority communities. But we are convinced the federal solutions they choseÑi.e., uniquely harsh sentences and the concomitant underfunding of prevention and treatment alternativesÑcannot be divorced from the longstanding public association of racial minorities with crime and drugs. href=""""#_ftn25"""" name=""""_ftnref25"""">25  All of these and other factors help explain why inner cities were targeted for drug law enforcement, why Congress set higher sentences for crack offenders than for powder cocaine, and why most federal crack defendants are blacks. But they do not offer a justification that can today withstand CERD's anti-discrimination principles.  The Commission cannot change law enforcement practices that target inner city communities. But it can act to eliminate or at least significantly reduce the powder/crack sentencing differential and thereto affirm the principles of justice and equal protection of the laws that should be the bedrock of U.S. law. Absent change, federal crack sentences will continue to deepen the racial fault lines that weaken the country and undermine faith among all races in the fairness of the criminal justice system.  V. Recommendations The Sentencing Commission should recommend to Congress that mandatory minimums for drug offenses should be eliminated.  If they are retained, they should be pegged to the level of the participant in the drug trade. Drug quantity should be designated as one factor to consider in determining the defendant's level of participation in the drug trade.   The Sentencing Commission should also amend its guidelines as follows:  Guidelines should be revised to ensure that low-level crack offenders do not receive disproportionately severe sentences. Under the guidelines base sentences should be keyed to role of defendant in drug trade, with aggravating (e.g., use of violence) or mitigating (e.g., providing assistance to law enforcement) factors raising or reducing that sentence as appropriate.  If drug quantities continue to play a dominant role in the guidelines, they should be seen as a proxy for the defendant's role in the offense. Where drug quantities are an inaccurate proxy (e.g., where a low-level defendant is charged with a large quantity of drugs because of the impact of conspiracy laws or multiple drug transactions) the guidelines should permit significant downward adjustments in the sentence.   Sentences for crack cocaine offenders should be equalized with those for powder cocaine offenders who engage in equivalent conduct. The disparities should be eliminated by increasing the quantities of crack required for given sentence to those required for powder cocaine offenses. The quantities for powder offenders should not be reduced to address the crack/powder sentencing disparity.  We are aware of no sound arguments that sentences for powder cocaine offenses are too low. The injustice caused by the arbitrary 100-to-1 ratio should not be cured by an equally arbitrary change to powder cocaine sentences, particularly when the change would be motivated by calculations of political appeal. Politics has already played a pernicious role in federal drug sentencing.  The Commission must uphold non-political principled sentencing.   1 Matthew Durose and Patrick Langan, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1998, Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice (1998), Table 3.  2 Martin Killias et al., ÒSentencing in Switzerland in 2000,Ó Overcrowded Times vol. 10, no. 6 (1999), p. 1, 18-19, citing figures from the Council of Europe's 1990 Bulletin d'informacion pŽnologique, no. 15.  3 United States Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress: Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy, 1995, Washington, D.C., 1995. 4 The United States ratified the ICCPR on June 8, 1992, CAT on October 21, 1994, and CERD on October 21, 1994.

Imprisoned individuals lose their liberty, autonomy, and the free exercise of most rights. They are deprived of their families, friends, jobs, and communities. Their ability to work, plan, and express themselves is severely restricted.  In many prisons, life is degrading, demoralizing, dehumanizing, and dangerous: overcrowding and violence threaten inmates' health, safety, privacy, and dignity. Sending a parent or family breadwinner to prison wreaks havoc on the financial and social stability of prisoners' families and harms children's development.

The organization made the appeal on the eve of the Commission's annual six-week meeting, which will start in Geneva on Monday, March 18 The Commission will hold its first session since the attacks in the United States on September 11. Human Rights Watch noted that a number of governments have cynically tried to take advantage of the anti-terrorist struggle to justify or intensify their own crackdowns on political opponents, armed insurgencies, or religious groups. The organization called on the Commission to monitor the effect of anti-terrorism measures on the observance of human rights.  Human Rights Watch also noted that this year's Commission again has an unusually high number of abusive governments among its 53 members. Members this year include Algeria, Bahrain, Burundi, China, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, Kenya, Libya, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Togo, Uganda and Vietnam. Human Rights Watch called for an international inquiry to investigate abuses in Chechnya and establish an official record of violations committed by both sides during the conflict.  """"Russian forces continue to commit atrocities in Chechnya,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"For the past two years, the Commission has asked Russia to rein in its forces and bring abusers to justice. In light of the Russian government's failure to comply, the Commission must now act.""""  In 2000 and 2001, the Commission called on Russia to conduct an investigation of abuses by its forces and to allow designated U.N. human rights investigators and rapporteurs to monitor human rights on the ground. Russia has invited the special rapporteur on violence against women and a special investigator on children in armed conflict. But it has persistently refused to invite investigators on torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions, which are at the heart of the cycle of abuse in Chechnya. Not a single high-level commander has had to answer for atrocities.  """"Countries that sponsored the resolution last year have an obligation to follow through this year,"""" said Brody.  Human Rights Watch also pointed out that U.N. member states are increasingly electing abusive governments to serve on the Commission, including governments that refuse visits by Commission monitors. For instance, Commission envoys on torture and extrajudicial executions have been trying in vain for several years to visit Algeria, a country that has never received a Commission rapporteur.  """"Having abusive governments on the Commission is like asking crooks to enforce the law,"""" said Brody. """"Governments eager to serve on the Commission on Human Rights must be willing to live up to the responsibilities of membership.""""  The group called on the Commission to press for the establishment of an international observer mission to monitor and report publicly on continuing abuses in Gaza and the West Bank. The organization said that such a presence could itself improve security for civilians while providing the international community with the independent and credible evidence needed to determine if further protective steps are necessary.  Human Rights Watch also called on the Commission to:  · Support efforts to hold accountable those responsible for atrocities in Afghanistan;  · Expand the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in Colombia  · Condemn the systematic violation of human rights in China;  · Renew the mandate of the Special Representative on human rights in Iran and to press for his access to the country;  · Establish monitoring offices in Sudan and neighboring countries;  · Seek a visit by the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention to those in U.S. custody in relation to the September 11 attacks, as well as to those held on Guantanamo Naval base;  · Support the expeditious establishment of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission;  · Appoint a special rapporteur to monitor human rights in Uzbekistan; and  · Condemn abuses in Indonesia, in particular in Aceh and Papua.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

It also urged India to bring to justice those responsible for the recent communal violence in Gujarat state, including police officers that failed to intervene to uphold the law. Since February 27, more than 600 people have been killed in Gujarat, most of them Muslims. The violence began after a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra, apparently angered by the hooliganism of Hindu activists, torched a train on which the latter were riding; more than sixty passengers were killed. The activists were returning from Ayodhya where a campaign led by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to construct a Hindu temple on the site of a mosque destroyed by Hindu militants in 1992 continues to raise the spectre of further violence. Riots in the city of Bombay in 1992 and 1993 following the destruction of the mosque claimed hundreds of lives.  """"Those responsible for torching the train as well as those responsible for revenge attacks on Muslim communities must be brought to justice,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"A criminal investigation should also be launched into possible complicity of officials in Gujarat in the killings, and for the delay in taking action to prevent Hindu retaliation.""""  Human Rights Watch praised Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as well as the National Human Rights Commission for their quick condemnation of the killings, and called on the central and state governments to ensure that impunity for campaigns against minorities - past and present - is ended.  """"The atrocities in Gujarat are a replay of events in Bombay in 1992 and 1993,"""" Narula said. """"Had the recommendations of the Srikrishna Commission been implemented, we might have been able to avoid the carnage of the last two weeks."""" The Srikrishna Commission, under the direction of former Supreme Court Justice B.N. Srikrishna, issued a report in 1998 on the Bombay riots, much of it aimed at improving the behavior of police in handling communal riots.  Human Rights Watch also expressed serious concern about the condition of makeshift camps in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, where an estimated 35,000 people remain after fleeing the savage clashes. According to the findings of the Citizens' Initiative for Justice and Peace, a human rights coalition, local authorities are preventing riot victims from leaving the camps. The camps are desperately lacking the most basic necessities, including food and medical supplies. Sanitation in the camps is extremely poor.  Human Rights Watch called on the Indian government to provide needed supplies, to improve basic conditions at the camps, and to take all necessary measures to ensure that local and international relief agencies are able to assist the riot victims.  Human Rights Watch noted that potential for further outbreaks of communal violence in Gujarat and elsewhere remains high, given the stated plans of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad to hold a puja (a Hindu ceremony) in Ayodhya on March 15. The Supreme Court will make a final decision on whether the ceremony will be held in a less controversial site on Wednesday, March 13. The issue of whether or not a Hindu temple will be built on the site of the destroyed mosque remains bitterly contested.","Asia, India","Religious Freedom"

The journalist, Siamak Pourzand, was arbitrarily detained by security forces outside his sister's house at 9:00 pm on November 29, 2001. His family's efforts to find out where he is being held have been unsuccessful, though his sister was allowed to visit him on three occasions, for short periods of time, at the office of the Public Morals Police and the State Inspectorate. The Inspectorate is the same place to which many Iranian intellectuals, writers and journalists have been summoned in recent months by a shadowy parallel intelligence apparatus. """"The judicial authorities are making a mockery of rule of law in Iran,"""" said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Iranian authorities have given no reason to hold Mr. Pourzand, and by law they should release him immediately.""""  Mr. Pourzand has had no access to lawyers or to medical assistance during his four months of incommunicado detention.  On March 9, the official newspaper Iran Daily reported unexpectedly that Pourzand's trial had begun in public on March 6, and that he was represented by his lawyer. According to the same report, in the first trial session Pourzand allegedly made a """"confession"""" that prior to the Islamic Revolution of 1979 he had been working for the Iranian secret service (Savak). Pourzand's family have contradicted this information adding that their attempts to present documentation assigning him a lawyer were denied by the authorities. None of the charges against him have been made public.  Megally added that judicial authorities have used incommunicado detentions and forced confessions repeatedly in recent years against independent activists.  On March 8, Pourzand briefly telephoned his youngest daughter in Washington, D.C. and, according to her testimony, asked that his family treat him as if he were dead. He also confirmed that his trial had started the day before.  Siamak Pourzand heads the Artistic and Cultural Complex in Tehran and he has also worked as cultural commentator with several reformist newspapers. All of them have since been closed.  Human Rights Watch is concerned that this prosecution is a continuation of a pattern of repression against reformist and independent figures that has gathered momentum since February's 2000 parliamentary elections. Since then virtually every independent newspaper has been closed down and leading editors, journalists, and thinkers have been imprisoned.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/12/uzbekistans-empty-promises","Uzbekistans Empty Promises","Uzbekistan's Empty Promises","","03/12/2002","President Bush is meeting today with the only world leader who honestly can say he has won the war on terrorism. Uzbekistan's President Islam Karimov, now making his first visit to the White House, is a lucky man. Before September 11, his regime was threatened by a violent al-Qaeda-affiliated group known as the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, or IMU, which raided Uzbek territory from Afghanistan under the protection of the Taliban. So Mr. Karimov offered U.S. forces a base to strike at Afghanistan and, more reluctantly, a bridge to bring in relief. Now, thanks to America, IMU fighters in Afghanistan have suffered huge losses.   The IMU's leader, and Mr. Karimov's greatest enemy, was reportedly killed by U.S. bombing. Uzbekistan's ethnic allies in the Northern Alliance have gone from near defeat to a share of power in Kabul. Meanwhile, Uzbekistan's U.S. aid budget has tripled. It has new stature as America's closest ally in Central Asia. While America's war goes on, Uzbekistan's is virtually over. What makes Uzbekistan's triumph awkward for the United States is that it seems to undercut Mr. Bush's pledge that the war will advance freedom. Uzbekistan is a relic of the Soviet past — a place where government opponents are purged, jailed or exiled, where authorities hold Stalin-style public denunciations of """"enemies of the state,"""" where dissidents are forced into psychiatric institutions, and where Muslims are jailed and tortured for practicing their faith outside state controls.   Mr. Karimov himself came to power in a flawed election amid the chaos of the Soviet empire's collapse. Before his last """"re-election,"""" even his handpicked opponent announced he was voting for the incumbent president. When the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized Uzbek elections, Mr. Karimov offered a charming reply: """"The OSCE focuses only on establishment of democracy, the protection of human rights and the freedom of the press. I am now questioning these values.""""   You might think there is a dilemma here: On the one hand, Uzbekistan is ruled by ruthless people; on the other, the country is vital to America's war effort. Indeed, Uzbekistan helped the United States defeat a state-sponsor of terrorism in Afghanistan. But it is itself a state-spawner of terrorism — a country that denies its people all peaceful avenues for dissent, thus driving opposition underground, into the shadows, right into the hands of radical Islamic groups. Uzbekistan's help in the war must be weighed against the harm these policies do.   To its credit, the Bush administration seems to agree. Elizabeth Jones, the assistant secretary of state responsible for Central Asia, argues: """"If the people of this country feel they have no choices, feel they have no voice in determining their parliament, their president . . . [they] are going to find a much more congenial home in extremist organizations."""" In recent weeks, the administration has pressed Uzbekistan hard to release political prisoners and to open up some space for peaceful political organizations. Just before the summit, it convinced Mr. Karimov to let one of Uzbekistan's banned human rights groups function openly and legally for the first time.   Still, with U.S. aid flowing unconditionally, Mr. Karimov probably believes he can avoid more fundamental change. The administration has not tied the millions it is pouring into Uzbekistan to specific demands because it hopes aid will do good, strengthening education, health care and civil society. But the aid, much of which in fact goes to the Uzbek military, could just as easily help Mr. Karimov delay tough political and economic reforms. It could associate America with another abusive regime in the Muslim world.   The key is to link U.S. engagement directly to U.S. concerns about human rights. For example, Mr. Karimov has asked the United States to make its military bases in Uzbekistan permanent. The Pentagon has expressed little interest. But the administration should not give up its leverage by rejecting Mr. Karimov's offer outright. It should tell him bluntly that the nature of its security partnership will depend on his progress in ending human rights abuses and openness to political change.   Above all, the administration should not allow Mr. Karimov to keep playing on America's gratitude for his role in the war. Uzbekistan's president helped America in his own self-interest and benefited from the war more than any other U.S. ally. Meanwhile, his repression continues to threaten America's interests by alienating peaceful Muslim believers in a region where terrorist groups may still be looking for recruits.   Mr. Bush should make clear today that Uzbekistan owes America more than a base and a bridge. If Mr. Karimov is serious about helping defeat terrorism, he owes his people, America, and the world a more open society.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Uzbekistan",""

During the past week, at least three ambulances have been fired upon, three ambulance staff have died, and nine other medical personnel have been injured.  Human Rights Watch called on the Israeli government to respect international humanitarian law, which stipulates that respect for the safety of medical personnel and ambulances is a basic duty of all forces and individuals involved in fighting. Human Rights Watch called for investigations into all incidents of firing on emergency medical personnel.  """"Attacking humanitarian personnel and their vehicles is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Israel should take immediate steps to prevent any recurrence of these attacks.""""  Human Rights Watch said that deliberate attacks on medical personnel, vehicles and infrastructure constitute a grave breach of the Geneva Conventions.  On March 4, the head of the Palestinian Red Crescent Service (PRCS) emergency medical service in Jenin, Dr. Khalil Sulieman, was killed and another five PRCS staff injured when Israeli troops shot at their ambulances in Jenin refugee camp. Initial explanations from the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) indicated that the ambulance was fired on when it was observed to be speeding towards a group of Israeli soldiers. Medical personnel in the area have said that, contrary to these claims, Dr. Sulieman was killed after an IDF soldier fired a projectile at his ambulance as it drove slowly down a narrow street. Oxygen containers in the ambulance then blew up as a result of either direct impact or heat, causing a secondary explosion.  Ibrahim Assad, a PRCS driver, and Kamal Salem, of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) were killed by Israeli fire on March 7 while en route to provide emergency assistance to wounded in the West Bank town of Tulkarem. Medical personnel have informed Human Rights Watch that Ibrahim Assad had received permission to move forward from the Israeli authorities. He drove some 750 meters, and was shot in the hand from the machine gun of an Israeli tank. He exited the ambulance, and was then shot in the head.  The International Committee of the Red Cross and PRCS have publicly stated that all ambulances were clearly marked and were coordinating their movements closely with the Israeli authorities.  """"Israel should investigate these deaths in a credible and transparent manner, and discipline or bring to justice those found responsible for any wrongdoing,"""" Stork said.  Human Rights Watch expressed further concern that ambulances had reportedly been prevented from gaining access to injured in Tulkarem refugee camp.

Militia groups affiliated with the party of President Robert Mugabe have carried out serious acts of violence against rural dwellers and landless workers on commercial farms, the report said. Human Rights Watch also received reports of discrimination in the distribution of land on political grounds. “Many of the people who were supposed to benefit from this reform have actually been targets of the violence,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.  Colonial policies of expropriation gave white farmers huge, free tracts of fertile land in what is now Zimbabwe, while rural black people were restricted to crowded “tribal reserves” of little agricultural value. From independence in 1980 until 2000, this unjust situation changed little.  In 2000, President Mugabe’s government passed new laws allowing expropriation of land without compensation, and encouraging landless peasants to occupy commercial farmland.  In the forty-page report, “Fast Track Land Reform in Zimbabwe,” Human Rights Watch provides testimonies from people who said that many of those who wanted land under the “fast track” program had to show support for the ruling party, ZANU-PF, and those who supported the opposition were denied land. The landless laborers who live and work on the commercial farms have been largely excluded from land redistribution. Among the most disadvantaged Zimbabweans, they have also been particular targets of state-sponsored violence.  The government also failed to ensure that women, particularly married women, benefited from the land reform, despite its stated commitment to gender balance.  While there has been some reduced violence on commercial farms in recent months, and undoubtedly some land has been allocated, problems persist. Many people are being allocated land without security of title and without adequate start-up infrastructure or resources to become self-sufficient farmers.  Party militias led by veterans of Zimbabwe’s liberation war have been in the forefront of the violence, though farm workers and opposition supporters have also retaliated on occasion. The Human Rights Watch report, researched in 2001, documents how these militia assaulted farm owners, farm workers, and residents of rural areas surrounding commercial farmland. The report says that the police did almost nothing to stop the violence.  Human Rights Watch called for the post-election government in Zimbabwe to bring to justice those responsible for abuses, and take steps to ensure that the violence does not recur. Additionally, any government-sponsored land reform must respect the rule of law.  A successful program of land reform is crucial for human rights in Zimbabwe, and the international community should be committed to addressing the plight of rural dwellers and farm workers. International logistic and financial assistance is critical to improve the infrastructure necessary to for land reform.","Africa, Zimbabwe",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/08/greece-recommendations-draft-trafficking-bill","Greece- Recommendations on Draft of Trafficking Bill","Greece: Recommendations on Draft of Trafficking Bill","","03/08/2002","Human Rights Watch has reviewed the most recent draft of the Greek trafficking bill and offers these comments to the bill's drafters and to parliamentarians who will debate the law at some time in the near future. Human Rights Watch hopes that these suggestions will prove useful as lawmakers combat the human rights abuse of trafficking and bring Greek law into conformity with the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children (Trafficking Protocol), supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, signed by Greece on December 13, 2000.1 The comments reflect Human Rights Watch's research findings in Greece, published in Greek and in English in a July 2001 memorandum of concern submitted to the government of Greece.2 PART A: Criminal Law Article 9 of the draft law outlines the proposed revisions to Article 351: Trafficking in Human Beings.3 Human Rights Watch believes that the revisions to the criminal code outlined in that article only partially bring Greek law into compliance with international standards. We have particular concerns about the definition of trafficking used in the article. Article 3 of the Trafficking Protocol defines trafficking as: (a)...the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harboring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs.4 (Emphasis added)   As discussed below, Human Rights Watch believes that the language on consent and references to """"sexual exploitation"""" do not match the international norm. We also believe that the draft law should provide a separate provision criminalizing the trafficking of children and specific language on penalties for officials who knowingly facilitate and profit from trafficking in human beings. Recommendations: · Criminalize all forms of trafficking of persons, not just trafficking into the sex industry. The Trafficking protocol requires states to implement comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the current draft legislation - Article 351: Trafficking in Human Beings - criminalizes only trafficking of persons for """"sexual exploitation."""" This definition conflicts with the accepted international legal definition of trafficking, Article 3 (above), which includes all forms of """"forced labor, services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs."""" The draft law's truncated definition of the crime excludes many trafficking victims from the law's protection, leaving them without remedy. Human Rights Watch's research in Greece, conducted in November 2000, indicated that some migrant women had been trafficked into Greece for service as domestic labor in households. Moreover, we discovered evidence that some migrant children selling flowers and other merchandise in Athens' intersections (so-called """"traffic light children"""") were also trafficked into Greece. Article 4 of the Trafficking Protocol requires Greece to """"adopt such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences the conduct set forth in article 3 of [the] protocol, when committed intentionally,"""" including trafficking into other forms of forced labor. Human Rights Watch does not believe that Article 12, paragraph 3 of the draft law amending Article 8(g) of the Penal Code sufficiently addresses this issue with its reference to """"an act of the slave trade."""" Instead, Human Rights Watch recommends that a definition of trafficking that conforms with the definition in the Trafficking Protocol is adopted and that trafficking for all forms of forced labor is criminalized. Human Rights Watch would also recommend the inclusion of forced marriage under the definition of """"servitude"""" and the inclusion of debt bondage as one of the forms of """"fraud.""""5 · Make the consent of the victim of trafficking to the intended abuse irrelevant. As outlined in Article 3(b) of the Trafficking Protocol, """"The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth in paragraph (a) of this article [see definition above] shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth in subparagraph (a) have been used."""" While the draft law's Article 9 (revising Article 351 of the current penal code) addresses this issue in part, it does not fully eliminate the question of consent. The proposed language to replace Article 351 of the Greek Penal code limits the consent provision to only those instances where a trafficker gains such consent by """"making promises, giving presents, providing payment or other benefits or by the use of fraudulent means."""" The Trafficking Protocol states that consent is irrelevant where any of the means described in subparagraph (a) have been employed by a trafficker. Thus, we recommend that the draft law's language fully conform with the protocol's text with respect to the consent of the trafficking victim. · Limit the definition of """"sexual exploitation"""" to those situations involving deceptive or coercive practices. If the term """"sexual exploitation"""" is to be used in the Greek law in the context of trafficking, it must be defined more clearly than the text in paragraph 5 of Article 351.6 This broad definition goes far beyond the intent of the protocol and fails to include any of the protocol's language on coercion, fraud, or use of force. It is important to recognize that traffickers commonly employ physical and non-physical means of coercion, including physical violence and threat of physical violence, deceit, debt bondage, blackmail, isolation, and/or psychological pressure. One proposed alternative definition is: the participation by a person in prostitution, sexual servitude, or the production of pornographic materials as a result of being subjected to a threat, coercion, abduction, force, abuse of authority, debt bondage, or fraud. · Create a separate penal provision criminalizing the trafficking of children. As noted in Article 3(c) of the Trafficking Protocol, trafficking of children does not require the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion to qualify as a criminal act. In addition, trafficking of children should not be limited to trafficking for """"sexual exploitation,"""" but instead should include trafficking for the purpose of placing the child into any form of slavery, forced labor, or servitude, or into any other type of labor condemned under the ILO Convention concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor (Convention 182).7 Children do not have the same capacity to make decisions about their migration and employment as adults. When children are placed into employment conditions that have been condemned as a """"worst form"""" of child labor by the International Labor Organization, evidence of coercion should not be necessary to qualify the practice as trafficking. · Criminalize complicity and corruption by state officials, law enforcement officials, and customs agents. Human Rights Watch's research in Greece and around the world indicates that trafficking, in most cases, cannot flourish without corrupt officials to facilitate border crossing, to generate false documents, and to provide protection for abusive employers. While paragraph 2(c) of Article 349 of the draft law creates enhanced penalties for perpetrators of trafficking who are related to the victim, the legislation should also provide explicit penalties for police officers, immigration officers, and other officials engaging in trafficking.8   PART B: Victim Protection Measures Articles 13 and 14 of the draft law provide for some minimal protections for trafficking victims in Greece.9 Human Rights Watch believes that the protections outlined in these articles, while positive, are inadequate. The current draft does not indicate who decides whether a victim is """"in danger,"""" who provides shelter or medical treatment, nor does it create sufficient protections for children. We make the following recommendations: · In cooperation with local nongovernmental organizations, the government of Greece should provide """"appropriate housing, counseling and information on legal rights, medical, psychological and material assistance, employment, educational and training opportunities"""" for all trafficking victims. These requirements, set forth in Article 5 of the Trafficking Protocol, apply to all trafficking victims, """"in appropriate cases and to the extent possible,"""" not just to those who agree to testify before criminal tribunals in the country of destination. Human rights protections should be available to all victims, whether or not they agree to cooperate or testify. The government of Greece should provide funding to nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and intergovernmental bodies with expertise in the field to assist in the provision of these services to trafficking victims. · Trafficked persons should not be detained or imprisoned. Housing in prisons and detention centers does not constitute """"appropriate housing"""" as contemplated by Article 6, paragraph 3(a) of the Trafficking Protocol. Punitive measures directed at trafficking victims - in particular detention pending deportation - should be waived. All efforts should be made to place trafficking victims apprehended by the police in secure private residences or safe shelters. Likewise, trafficking victims who go voluntarily to the police for assistance should not be detained. Government-sponsored women's shelters should be opened to trafficked women and the government should provide funding to nongovernmental organizations that operate secure shelters for trafficking victims. · The government of Greece should provide witness protection to those trafficking victims who agree to participate in criminal proceedings. The government of Greece should protect victims or witnesses who cooperate in legal proceedings against their traffickers, with measures to ensure their safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity, privacy, and right to timely repatriation to their country of origin. The full range of witness protection measures should be made available to trafficking victims participating in criminal proceedings. Victim protection is essential for successful prosecutions. As required by Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Trafficking Protocol, Greece should protect the privacy and identity of trafficking victims. None of these measures should be prejudicial to or inconsistent with the rights of the accused to a fair and impartial trial. · Frozen assets of traffickers should be made available to victims, in accordance with due process protections, to settle financial claims for violations of their human and civil rights. Article 6, paragraph 6 of the Trafficking Protocol requires states to ensure that their domestic legal systems contain """"measures that offer victims of trafficking in persons the possibility of obtaining compensation for damage suffered."""" Greece should make assets confiscated from traffickers (in accordance with due process protections) available to settle financial claims of trafficking victims. When the proceeds of unjust enrichment through trafficking have been confiscated through appropriate legal procedures, they should be used to provide victims with remedies for the abuses they have suffered. In addition, trafficking victims should have a right to collect back wages through civil proceedings. · The government of Greece should refrain from the immediate expulsion of trafficked persons, offering all victims of trafficking the opportunity to remain in the country while they weigh their legal options. Articles 13(2) and 14(1)(b) of the draft law call for a suspension of deportation under narrow circumstances.10 In contrast, the Trafficking Protocol presses states to consider """"adopting legislative or other appropriate measures that permit victims of trafficking in persons to remain in [the state's] territory, temporarily or permanently, in appropriate cases.""""11 Trafficked persons should be given the time, information, and assistance needed to initiate legal proceedings against their traffickers or employers. Where trafficked persons decide to initiate a civil action and/or act as a witness in a criminal action, they should be allowed to remain in the country for the duration of such case, including all appeals, not just until the """"penal prosecution of the perpetrator"""" is resolved, as outlined in the draft law. Trafficked persons in Greece awaiting criminal or civil trial should be provided with the right to work and/or other means of support. · The government of Greece should adopt provisions allowing for the permanent resettlement of trafficked persons, giving appropriate consideration to humanitarian and compassionate factors in determining these cases. Such measures should be in addition to Greece's obligation to protect the right to seek and enjoy asylum and to uphold the fundamental principle of non-refoulement. · Repatriation of trafficking victims to their countries of origin should only be undertaken with due regard for the safety and security of the trafficked person and should preferably be voluntary. Article 8 of the Trafficking Protocol requires that countries of destination such as Greece return trafficking victims to their countries of origin with care for the safety and security of the person. Repatriations must also be undertaken with due regard for the """"status of any legal proceedings related to the fact that the person is a victim of trafficking and should preferably be voluntary.""""     Special Provisions for Child Victims of Trafficking Article 6, paragraph 4 of the Trafficking Protocol requires states to take into account """"the special needs of children, including appropriate housing, education, and care."""" The current version of the draft law states, """"Minors are placed into educational and vocational programs."""" This provision does not effectively address the special needs of child victims of trafficking. Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations: · In the case of a child victim of trafficking, the government of Greece should take steps to locate the family members of the trafficked child, ascertain the circumstances under which the child became a victim of trafficking, and make a determination about placement in accordance with the best interests of the child. Once a determination has been made, the government of Greece should facilitate the child's safe and humane return (or other placement). The goal of the state's efforts should be the prompt reunification of the child with her/his family unless the best interests of the child dictate otherwise, giving consideration to the wishes of the child, as required by Article 3 of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.12 · Children should receive special assistance, including legal counsel. Greece should also include a provision in part B of the draft law to ensure that monetary awards made to children are actually received by them through the formation of a trust or other legal mechanism.13 · Under no circumstances should trafficked children be placed in punitive institutions, such as juvenile detention centers or remand homes for children. Shelters or group homes for trafficked children must have adequate security to protect residents from traffickers. They must also be given access to education and health care (including psychological support) in conformity with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, in addition to the services described in the recommendations above.   Footnotes: 1 For easy reference, we have appended the Trafficking Protocol to this document. 2 The memorandum can be found on Human Rights Watch's website at http://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/eca/greece/index.htm. 3 Article 351. Trafficking in Human Beings: 1. Any person who by force, by threat or by other coercive means or by imposing or abusing authority hires, transports within or outside the country, harbors, hands over to somebody in exchange for something or nothing or receives from somebody a person with the aim of sexually exploiting that person himself or somebody else is punished by imprisonment of up to ten years; 2. The sentence of the above paragraph is imposed on the perpetrator if, with the same aim, he procures the consent of a person in need by making promises, giving presents, providing payment or other benefits or by the use of fraudulent means. 3. A prison sentence of at least ten years and a fine of fifty to one hundred thousand Euros is imposed on the perpetrator according to the previous paragraphs, if the deed a) was committed against a person younger than 18 years old; b) was committed by one of the people in paragraph 2c of article 349; c) is related to the illegal entry, residence or exit of the victim from the country; d) is practiced as a profession. 4. If any of the deeds of the previous paragraphs resulted in a grave physical injury of the victim an imprisonment of at least ten years is imposed and if it resulted in the victim's death, life imprisonment is imposed. 5. Sexual exploitation as understood in the previous paragraphs consists of any licentious act for profit or the use for profit of the body, voice, or image of a person for such real or simulated acts or for the provision of labor or services which aim at sexual arousal. 4 The footnote to this text in the Trafficking Protocol states, """"The travaux preparatoires should indicate that the Protocol addresses the exploitation of the prostitution of others and other forms of sexual exploitation only in the context of trafficking in persons. The terms """"exploitation of the prostitution of others"""" or """"other forms of sexual exploitation"""" are not defined in the Protocol, which is therefore without prejudice to how States Parties address prostitution in their respective domestic laws."""" 5  Slavery-like practices should be understood to include those practices condemned under the 1956 Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. These practices include, among others, debt bondage and forced marriage. Greece ratified this convention on December 13, 1972. 6 Article 351(5) Sexual exploitation as understood in the previous paragraphs consists of any licentious act for profit or the use for profit of the body, voice, or image of a person for such real or simulated acts or for the provision of labor or services which aim at sexual arousal. 7 Greece ratified this convention on November 6, 2001. 8 Article 349. Pandering 1. Any person who in order to serve the debauchery of others procures or corrupts minors or facilitates the prostitution or corruption of minors is punished by imprisonment of up to ten years and is fined with the amount of ten to fifty thousand Euros, should a reason for a more severe punishment not arise. 2. The sentence is extended to at least ten years of imprisonment and a fine of fifty to one hundred thousand Euros if the offense was committed: a) against a person younger than 16 years old; b) with deceitful means; c) by an ascending relation by blood or affinity or foster parent, spouse, or other person who is raising, educating, or caring for the minor, even temporarily. 9 Article 13. Aid to Victims 1. If in direct danger, the victims of the crimes described in articles 349, 351, and 351A are provided with protection, especially that is of their life, physical integrity and their personal and sexual freedom. Aid is also provided for their shelter, nutrition, medical care, and psychological support. Care is also taken in order to guarantee legal counsel and a translator should this be required during their relationship with the Greek authorities. Minors are placed into educational and vocational programs. The details for the application of this provision are established by a presidential decree. 2. Regarding the victims of the above mentioned acts in paragraph one who are aliens and are in the country illegally and with the qualifications regarding their repatriation in the following article, it is possible to suspend deportation following the order of the magistrate court's district attorney and the approval of the court of appeal's district attorney until a final ruling is reached in the penal prosecution of the perpetrator. 3. The details regarding the execution of the deportation decisions according to the previous paragraph are regulated by paragraph 8 of article 44 S, 2910/2001. Article 14. Repatriation 1. Aliens who are in the country illegally and who are victims of the crimes of articles 349, 351, and 351A of the penal code are safely repatriated without offending the victim's bodily integrity: a) by their own will which is put into writing before a public authority; b) if the victim does not wish to be repatriated and the reasons for this are considered well-founded, then the district general secretary can allow for the victim's temporary stay in the country until the reasons for which the repatriation was not possible have been resolved. c) if the victim is a minor then a report is filed by the commissioner of minors and the agreement of the minors' district attorney is required for the minor's repatriation. 2. The procedure, manner, expenditures and every other detail relating to the repatriation of alien victims according to paragraph 1 are regulated by a presidential decree issued with a motion of the ministers of public administration, justice, and public order. 10 Article 13(2): Regarding the victims of the above mentioned deeds in paragraph 1 who are aliens and are in the country illegally, and with the qualifications regarding their repatriation of the following article, it is possible to suspend deportation...until a final ruling is reached in the penal prosecution of the perpetrator.

The Human Rights Watch commentary is based on the findings of a Human Rights Watch """"memorandum of concern"""" on trafficking into Greece published in July 2001. The commentary highlights the following specific problems with the draft legislation: · The draft law fails to criminalize all forms of trafficking in persons, focusing only on trafficking into the sex industry. This omission excludes victims of trafficking into other forms of forced labor. Those victims deserve the same protections and remedies as those persons trafficked into forced prostitution. · The draft law fails to provide explicit penalties for complicity and other unlawful involvement in trafficking by law enforcement officials, customs agents, and other state officials. Trafficking in persons only flourishes with the cooperation of corrupt police and other officials. In research conducted in Greece in 2000 and 2001, Human Rights Watch found evidence of police involvement in trafficking in persons.  · The draft law does not explicitly prohibit the detention of persons for being trafficking victims. Trafficked persons are victims of serious human rights abuses and should not be detained or imprisoned.  · The draft law fails to outline explicit measures for witness protection in trafficking cases.

Bush should secure specific human rights improvements in Uzbekistan during his summit with Uzbek President Islam Karimov, Human Rights Watch said today. The two leaders meet at the White House on March 12. Previously a low-priority country in U.S. foreign policy, after September 11 Uzbekistan became a key ally in the campaign against terrorism. In a letter to President Bush, Human Rights Watch said that Uzbekistan's repressive policies restrict the possibility for peaceful dissent and drive opposition underground. """"In terms of human rights, Uzbekistan is barely distinguishable from its Soviet past, and President Karimov has shown himself to be an unreconstructed Soviet leader,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"You have to wonder whether this kind of record makes for a trusted ally or a foreign policy burden.""""  The U.S. State Department human rights reports, released on Monday, acknowledged that Uzbekistan was an """"authoritarian"""" state with a """"very poor"""" human rights record. The government allows no genuine political opposition, engages in Soviet-style, pre-publication censorship, and has not held a single election that came close to being """"free or fair"""" by international standards. The only alternative candidate in the 2000 presidential elections announced publicly that he voted for President Karimov.  During a January visit to Tashkent by high-level U.S. officials, President Karimov had his term in office extended until 2007 through a referendum that was roundly criticized by the international community as neither free nor fair. President Karimov has presided over the Uzbek government's campaign against those who practice Islam beyond state controls. Now in its fifth year, the campaign involves the arrest, torture, and wrongful imprisonment of thousands of people. Local officials stage Stalin-style """"hate rallies,"""" at which communities gather to upbraid perceived religious """"extremists"""" and their families. Law enforcement agents routinely detain family members as hostages to compel wanted suspects to turn themselves over to the police.  Human Rights Watch urges the Bush administration to set the following benchmarks:  The release of religious and political prisoners;  The registration of domestic human rights groups and independent political parties;  The reform of laws used to persecute independent Muslims and political dissidents; and  Access to the country for U.N. human rights monitors. On March 4, after six years of repeated requests, the Uzbek government registered the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan. Human Rights Watch welcomed this move, but noted that other groups, such as the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, have been seeking registration for years, and that two new groups, the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan """"Ez'gulik"""" and a group called """"The Oppressed,"""" are also seeking registration. Human Rights Watch called on the administration to use this step as a precedent to seek progress on other benchmarks. """"We'll be watching closely to see what the administration does next week in terms of sustaining pressure on the Uzbeks for human rights reform,"""" said Andersen. The summit comes a month after the Bush administration announced a tripling in assistance levels to Uzbekistan, in areas from civil society building to military aid.

The commentary highlights the following specific problems with the draft legislation: · The draft law fails to criminalize all forms of trafficking in persons, focusing only on trafficking into the sex industry. This omission excludes victims of trafficking into other forms of forced labor. Those victims deserve the same protections and remedies as those persons trafficked into forced prostitution. · The draft law fails to provide explicit penalties for complicity and other unlawful involvement in trafficking by law enforcement officials, customs agents, and other state officials. Trafficking in persons only flourishes with the cooperation of corrupt police and other officials. In research conducted in Greece in 2000 and 2001, Human Rights Watch found evidence of police involvement in trafficking in persons.  · The draft law does not explicitly prohibit the detention of persons for being trafficking victims. Trafficked persons are victims of serious human rights abuses and should not be detained or imprisoned.  · The draft law fails to outline explicit measures for witness protection in trafficking cases. Victims of trafficking require measures to ensure their safety, physical and psychological well-being, dignity, and privacy in order to testify against their traffickers.","Europe/Central Asia, Greece","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/07/recommendations-effective-special-court-sierra-leone","Recommendations for an Effective Special Court for Sierra Leone","Recommendations for an Effective Special Court for Sierra Leone","Letter to Legal Advisors of U.N. Security Council Member States and Interested States","03/07/2002","Dear Sir/Madam,   Human Rights Watch greatly appreciates the efforts by the Secretary-General, the Secretariat and the Group of Interested States to create a Special Court for Sierra Leone (the """"Special Court""""). We are also aware of the importance of the Special Court, both to bring justice to victims in Sierra Leone and to set a positive precedent for a new mechanism of international justice - one that combines international and domestic mechanisms and laws. With the return of the planning mission from Sierra Leone, we hope that preparations will now intensify to establish the Special Court. We believe it is critically important to maintain momentum.   While we have not seen the planning mission's report, we are aware of the significant logistical challenges in making the Special Court operational. With a limited budget and lagging voluntary pledges for the Special Court's second and third years, the Court's efficient establishment will be decisive to its legitimacy and effectiveness.   Before the issues related to establishing the Special Court go to the Security Council, we write to detail recommendations that we believe are critical to the Special Court's effectiveness. Since April 1999, Human Rights Watch has investigated human rights violations, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, in Sierra Leone. We have a small office in Freetown.   Some of our concerns, as discussed below, stem from the unique hybrid nature of the Special Court. This hybrid character creates challenges to ensure the Special Court's independence from the Government of Sierra Leone. At the same time, the funding of the Special Court through voluntary contributions makes it equally important to ensure the Special Court's independence from improper influence by donor states.   As you know, the Special Court will be unlike the two current ad hoc tribunals, not only in its structure, but also in having a Management Committee to oversee budgetary and administrative matters. We have high expectations that the Management Committee will play an important role enabling the Special Court to make the most of its resources through a combination of new, efficient and creative management. This will require flexibility and creativity. At the same time, we believe the United Nations' experience, and logistical and technical support will be a vital resource to the Special Court.   This letter organizes its discussion into issues relevant to (A) Chambers, (B) the Office of the Prosecutor, (C) the Registry (including the Victims and Witnesses Unit), and (D) Other Issues. In certain instances, the letter comments on the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (""""ICTR"""") since those will be the procedural rules initially used by the Special Court.[1]  A. CHAMBERS  The integrity, judicial independence and expertise of the persons who are selected to serve as judges on the Special Court will profoundly influence the justice that the Special Court will dispense. Selecting judges with appropriate qualifications and relevant experience, requiring the judges to act in accordance with the highest ethical standards, and providing appropriate training for the judges and their clerks are all key to ensuring the proper operation of the Special Court.   1. Judges should have experience as criminal trial judges.   Article 13 of the Statute of the Special Court for Sierra Leone (""""Special Court Statute"""") states that in hiring judges """"due account shall be taken of the experience of the judges in international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law, criminal law and juvenile justice."""" There is no requirement, however, that persons selected have expertise as criminal trial judges. Recruiting judges with this expertise is crucial to the Special Court and essential to the progress of trials. While we are aware that considerable progress has already been made in selecting judges to serve on the Special Court, we urge that any decisions made to date be reviewed in light of this criterion.   2. Judges and clerks should receive training.   Judges and clerks of the Special Court should receive training. That training should include:  a) substantive issues of international humanitarian law; b) sensitivity to victims and witnesses (including victims of sexual violence, child witnesses,[2] and particular groups that, due to poor education and/or illiteracy, may have difficulty understanding court procedures or questions asked of them); c) training on the procedural rules that will be utilized by the Special Court; since those procedural rules resemble those of the ICTR, and for judges who have primarily a common law background, training should focus on how those rules differ from common law rules; without proper training, judges may not be equipped to apply rules that are an amalgamation of civil and common law since certain practices necessarily will be unfamiliar to judges from either background; and d) sensitivity to the need to maintain judicial independence (discussed below).  Videotapes of training sessions should be made so that when there is turnover new personnel can view the videotapes if in-person training is not available.   Funds need to be raised specifically to fund such training. Alternatively, states should be encouraged to directly send experts to provide such training at no cost to the Special Court.   3. Rules should govern the conduct of the judges, and provide for disciplining and removing judges and other staff. There should also be a mechanism to investigate allegations of improper judicial conduct.    Judges for the Special Court need to be held to the highest judicial standards. It is important to develop rules governing the conduct of the judges, and to provide an independent mechanism for investigating allegations of improper conduct, and disciplining and removing judges. There currently is no such mechanism provided for in the ICTR's Rules of Procedure and Evidence. During the preparatory phase for the Special Court, a team of international judges, ideally with prior experience in international criminal law, should, together with the Prosecutor, draft a set of rules to govern the conduct of judges and other court staff, and propose a mechanism for enforcing such rules.   4. Judges need to maintain independence and impartiality.   While Article 13(1) of the Special Court Statute states that Special Court judges """"shall be independent in the performance of their functions,"""" it is crucial to emphasize that at all times, judges must act in such a way as to ensure their impartiality and independence from (a) the ruling party and Government of Sierra Leone, (b) other political leaders in Sierra Leone, (c) other states-particularly, donor states, states in the region and the judges' states of nationality, and (d) other entities.   The need to maintain the necessary independence from the Government of Sierra Leone will be especially difficult due to the """"mixed"""" nature of the Special Court. As you know, the Special Court is a hybrid court composed of international and domestic elements and will have judges appointed by the Government of Sierra Leone and a Sierra Leonean Deputy Prosecutor. Thus, the perception may arise that the institution is improperly influenced by the current Sierra Leonean government. It will be important to make clear that the Special Court is a free-standing body that is independent from influence and functions impartially.   5. A mechanism needs to be developed to ensure that cases move at an appropriate pace.   A mechanism needs to be developed to hold Special Court judges responsible for moving cases on their dockets. For instance, Rule 65 bis of the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) requires a status conference 120 days after the initial appearance, and 120 days thereafter. In Canada, the Federal Court Rules establish a status review mechanism that is automatically triggered at various stages. In the U.S. federal system, cases are flagged if they have been outstanding for more than three years, or a motion has been pending for more than six months. Not only is the slow processing of cases wasteful of resources, it raises fair trial issues if defendants are held in pre-trial detention too long.   B. OFFICE OF THE PROSECUTOR  More than any other single position, the Prosecutor will determine what the Special Court will be able to achieve. It will be critical that the Office of the Prosecutor act independently and impartially. Equally crucial will be setting out and identifying, at the earliest feasible moment, a prosecutorial strategy on how to bring those with the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian and Sierra Leonean law to justice.   1. The Office of the Prosecutor should be independent and act impartially.   It is crucial that the Office of the Prosecutor be independent from influence and act impartially.   One challenge will be ensuring independence from the Government of Sierra Leone. While Article 15(1) of the Special Court Statute states that the Prosecutor """"shall not seek or receive instructions from any Government or from any other source,"""" at the same time Article 15(2) states that the Prosecutor shall """"be assisted by the Sierra Leonean authorities."""" While it is important for local authorities to cooperate with the Special Court, it is also important that such assistance not appear to compromise the Prosecutor's independence. Again, the fact that the Special Court is a mixed institution will tend to make the Special Court appear to inherently favor the Sierra Leonean government. Special efforts will be needed to ensure independence and impartiality from improper influence.   It is equally important that the Office of the Prosecutor act independent of any improper political influence by other forces, such as donor states, regional states and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (""""UNAMSIL"""").   2. Consideration should be given to hiring professional staff from the region.   While Article 15(4) of the Special Court Statute requires that the Deputy Prosecutor be Sierra Leonean and that the Prosecutor be assisted by """"such other Sierra Leonean and international staff as may be required,"""" an effort needs to be made to ensure that, in addition to the Deputy Prosecutor, Sierra Leoneans serve as prosecutors and investigators, and not, for instance, only as support staff.   3. There needs to be a clear and comprehensive prosecutorial strategy from the outset.   While we are cognizant that it will be an enormous task for the Office of the Prosecutor to collate the rudimentary victim and witness statements that exist and to commence investigations, it is not too early for the Special Court to start developing criteria for an overall prosecutorial strategy. It will obviously take time to collect and systematize the evidence, map the crimes, determine patterns, obtain an overview of the systematic and widespread nature of the crimes, and determine the key players. At the same time, given the limited budget of the Special Court, and the fact that the budget will restrict the number of people the Court will be able to prosecute, it is crucial that the Special Court have a prosecutorial strategy that enables it to prosecute those who """"bear the greatest responsibility for serious violations of international humanitarian law and Sierra Leonean law.""""   While decisions as to who specifically to try will depend upon the findings of individual investigations, initial criteria for prosecutions can be set in advance.   We recommend that, in developing a strategy, the Office of the Prosecutor should focus on, among other things:  a) Seeking to identify those individuals who bear both direct and indirect command responsibility for the worst abuses and patterns of abuses; b) Ensuring that prosecutions include within the indictment, where relevant, counts related to crimes of sexual violence (discussed further below), abduction of civilians, and recruitment and forced conscription of children; c) Paying attention at an early stage to ascertaining which witnesses might enter plea agreements, which are helpful both in expediting cases, and obtaining information that can be used against other defendants; and d) Paying attention at an early stage to ascertaining when indictments against different individuals can be joined for more efficient use of court time.  The Office of the Prosecutor should note that a number of Sierra Leoneans who undoubtedly would have been investigated, if not indicted, by the Special Court are reported to have died. Investigations of key perpetrators who are reported to have died should be conducted to ascertain whether those persons are in fact dead.   4. Investigators and prosecutors should be trained on how to investigate crimes of sexual violence and violence committed by and against children.    Article 15(4) of the Special Court Statute provides that """"due consideration should be given in the appointment of staff to the employment of prosecutors and investigators experienced in gender-related crimes and juvenile justice."""" While we agree that it is crucial to hire people with such experience, the Special Court's Office of the Prosecutor should still design, in collaboration with relevant experts, a training program for prosecutors and investigators, to be held on a periodic basis. The training program should include a compulsory gender and children's rights sensitization training program for all staff and a more in-depth training course for those staff dealing more directly with cases involving sexual violence and children. The in-depth training should include instruction on investigating and prosecuting: (a) crimes of sexual violence, (b) crimes committed against children that constitute crimes within the Special Court's jurisdiction, and (c) crimes committed by children.   Human Rights Watch's fact-finding in Sierra Leone has revealed the commission of a range of crimes against women, including crimes of sexual violence and sexual slavery, as well as abductions and amputations. We have also documented extensive violence against children, including forced conscription, forced labor, sexual violence, amputations and mutilations. It will be important for prosecutors and investigators to know how to investigate such crimes and treat victims and witnesses appropriately.   Due to the limited resources of the Special Court, particular efforts will need to be made to raise funds to pay for training, and/or states should be encouraged to send experts to provide such training at no cost to the Special Court.   5. Crimes of sexual violence should be included as a focus of investigations and, where appropriate, included in indictments.   Because of the pervasive nature of the crimes of sexual violence in Sierra Leone, it will be critical for the Special Court's Office of the Prosecutor to ensure that investigators rigorously pursue leads and thoroughly investigate serious allegations of crimes of sexual violence. When evidence of sexual violence rises to the level of one of the crimes within the Special Court's jurisdiction, charges related to these offenses should be included in indictments.   Crimes of sexual violence are typically under-investigated and under-prosecuted. While the Statute of the Special Court recognizes that widespread or systematic sexual violence is a crime against humanity, it will be crucial to ensure that such crimes are recognized in practice. Investigators should avoid making assumptions about whether or not victims of sexual violence would want charges brought against perpetrators. Such assumptions could lead investigators to ignore leads in cases of sexual violence or to impose their own assumptions on the victim. Sexual violence cannot be dismissed as a regrettable but inevitable feature of armed conflict and civil unrest. It must be investigated and prosecuted like other crimes in these situations.   6. Investigators should be under the direct supervision of trial prosecutors rather than in a separate unit, and should provide ongoing investigative support both before and during trial.   Investigators should report to the Office of the Prosecutor and should be assigned to trial teams to provide support in pre-trial, trial and, if relevant, post-trial stages. Problems can occur if investigators are not under the direct supervision of trial prosecutors and do not continue to provide investigative support during the course of a trial. Prosecutors need to be able to go back to the same investigators that worked on the case originally and have the investigators help explain their findings and fill any gaps in the evidence. Problems can arise if the same investigators are not made available for such purposes.  C. THE REGISTRY  The Registry is responsible for the administration and servicing of the Special Court, and will contain a Victims and Witnesses Unit. The Registrar is in a position to regulate a whole host of issues, from prohibiting fee splitting, to prohibiting defendants from changing court-appointed counsel multiple times, to delineating qualifications needed to serve as counsel for an indigent defendant. Key to ensuring the proper functioning of the Victims and Witnesses Unit is creating accountability to the Registrar, handling prosecution and defense witnesses separately, and ensuring that appropriate measures are implemented regarding child witnesses and victims of sexual violence. The Registry should also ensure that vacancies at the Special Court are posted and filled promptly.   1. The Registry needs to be subordinate to Chambers and the Office of the Prosecutor.   The Registry should be subordinate to Chambers and the Office of the Prosecutor. The Registry should play a functionary role, assisting Chambers and the Office of the Prosecutor. It should not be the co-equal of Chambers and the Office of the Prosecutor.   2. The Registry and Registrar need to maintain independence.    Because any perception that the Registry or Registrar are biased will create the perception that the Special Court also is biased, the Special Court's Registry and Registrar should carefully maintain independence. If, for example, the Registrar provides money or assistance to certain victims but not to other victims, that could create the appearance that the Registry, and thus, the Court, favors one side. Strict neutrality will need to be maintained from, among others: (a) the ruling party and Government of Sierra Leone, (b) other political leaders in Sierra Leone, (c) other states-particularly, donor states and states in the region, and (d) UNAMSIL.   3. The Victims and Witnesses Unit should handle separately protection for prosecution and defense witnesses. There should not be a separate unit addressing gender-based issues.   The protection needs of defense and prosecution witnesses should be handled separately. However, there should not be a separate unit to address gender-based issues. Having a separate unit devoted to gender-based issues could create problems of coordination and collaboration.   4. The Victims and Witnesses Unit needs to ensure that witness protection is effective from the inception of an investigation, through trial and, where appropriate, post-trial.   The Special Court's witness protection program will need to be carefully designed so that witness protection functions at all stages. Witness protection cannot solely occur at trial, but needs to commence at the investigation stage, and potentially extend to post-trial protection.   At the investigation stage, consideration needs to be given to ensuring that in conducting interviews and transporting people to trials, witnesses' identities are not inadvertently divulged. For instance, if investigators travel to interview witnesses in clearly marked vehicles, the entire village then knows which individuals have spoken to investigators. If witnesses who agree to provide testimony are then picked up in the same type of vehicles, and flown to testify in clearly marked aircraft, their identities have in effect been revealed. In many cases, non-governmental organizations (""""NGO's"""") could be used as intermediaries to facilitate meetings between investigators and witnesses at safe locations so that witness identities are not compromised.   Careful procedures will also need to be put in place to ensure that lapses do not occur during trials. Witness protection programs must also protect witnesses after trial. If a witness has provided damaging testimony against a perpetrator, it is then that the witness may be in the most serious danger.   5. Members of the Victims and Witnesses Unit should receive specific training on addressing the specific issues facing traumatized witnesses, including victims of sexual violence, and children.   Members of the Victims and Witnesses Unit should receive training on addressing the specific issues facing traumatized witnesses, including victims of sexual violence, and children. Appropriate procedures should also be adopted regarding the treatment of such witnesses. For instance, it is important that survivors of sexual violence be treated with appropriate respect and dignity, by, among other things, being provided medical check-ups and new clothing before testifying.   6. Measures to prevent disclosure to the public or the media of the identity or whereabouts of a victim or a witness should be granted only on a case-by-case basis.   Under ICTR Rule 75, a variety of methods can be used to prevent disclosure to the public or the media of the identity or whereabouts of a victim or a witness. While the Rules, which permit judges to grant protective measures, should not be changed, Special Court judges should be encouraged to make the determination of whether to grant protected treatment on an individualized basis except where there are clear categories of witnesses likely to require such measures, such as children. Blanket grants of protected treatment will undermine the public nature of trials and will reduce the likelihood that false testimony will be publicly exposed. Grants of protected treatment, for instance, make little sense for well-known figures, and are also inappropriate unless the witness in fact seeks protected treatment. Presumptions also should not be made, for instance, that all victims of sexual violence do in fact wish to receive protected treatment.   7. The Registry needs to develop vetting procedures to ensure that persons hired by the Special Court were not perpetrators. The Registry also needs to fill vacancies promptly.   It is crucial that the Registry develop vetting procedures to ensure that no one who is hired is in fact a perpetrator or closely linked to individuals who may have been perpetrators (whether or not they are likely to be charged before the Special Court). It is both embarrassing and compromises the integrity of a court when background checks are not sufficiently conducted, and, for instance, an investigator is implicated in crimes that the Special Court would have jurisdiction to prosecute.   8. The Registry should establish an explicit rule prohibiting fee splitting.    The Registry should establish an explicit rule preventing a defense attorney from splitting fees with his or her client. Fee splitting is unethical and wasteful of resources.   9. Rules should make it difficult for indigent defendants to change attorneys multiple times.   The rules should make it difficult for indigent defendants to change attorneys multiple times without showing good cause. Multiple changes of counsel delay trials and waste resources. Under ICTR Rule 45(H), an indigent accused has to show both """"exceptional circumstances"""" and """"good cause"""" to have assigned counsel removed. That rule should be strictly applied at the Special Court. Frivolous motions to remove defense counsel should be rejected.   10. The Registry should make efforts to ascertain whether """"indigent"""" defendants are in fact indigent.    The Registry should make efforts to investigate whether """"indigent"""" defendants are in fact indigent, at least where there is some reasonable suspicion that the accused has significant assets. It wastes resources for a court to automatically pay for free legal counsel for all detainees based on claims of indigence when various detainees may not in fact be indigent. Any efforts in ascertaining whether a defendant is indigent should not, however, impede the assignment of appointed counsel and progress in the case.   11. The Registry should formulate criteria for selecting attorneys interested in serving as defense counsel for indigent defendants.    The Registry should formulate rules on qualifications required to serve as defense counsel for indigent defendants (including, for instance, requiring a minimum number of years of criminal trial experience). It is critically important to an accused's receiving a fair trial that he or she be provided qualified defense counsel. If all persons interested in serving as defense counsel are automatically allowed to serve, the quality of defense representation will vary widely.   12. To the extent resources allow, the Registry should make decisions, transcripts, and exhibits available on a website.   While we are aware of the serious resource constraints facing the Special Court, if it were possible, it would be useful to have a website for the Special Court where, at minimum, decisions, and possibly also transcripts and exhibits (redacted if necessary) could be made publicly available promptly. This would benefit operations of the Special Court, journalists reporting on the trials, and, potentially, the work of Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (""""TRC"""").   Given the limited amount of funds available to the Special Court, an effort should be made to ascertain if a state would be willing to contribute funds and/or appropriate experts to run the web site at no cost to the Special Court.  D. OTHER ISSUES  1. The problem of indictees who have fled Sierra Leone needs to be addressed; mandatory obligations to surrender indictees need to be created.   Many Revolutionary United Front (""""RUF"""") commanding officers, for instance, have already left Sierra Leone, and have been recruited to fight in Liberia. Other RUF members openly boast that they plan to leave Sierra Leone before the Special Court becomes operational. Problems are compounded by the poor state of the intelligence service in Sierra Leone, and the role several neighboring West African states have played in supporting one or another warring faction.   The UN Security Council should adopt a resolution mandating that states comply with requests by the Special Court to surrender persons under indictment. In addition, the Organization of African States (OAS), and Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) should separately require member states to comply with such requests.   2. The relationship between the Special Court and the TRC needs to be defined and codified upon or prior to establishment of the two institutions.   While there have been discussions on the overall issue of the relationship between the Special Court and the TRC, the relationship needs to be specifically defined. Suggestions on how to define that relationship will be the subject of a separate letter from Human Rights Watch.   3. The Management Committee needs to be involved in continued monitoring of the performance of the Special Court's judges, prosecutors and registry.   The performance of all parts of the Special Court will need monitoring to ensure that any problems are addressed early and that any needed reforms are implemented. The Management Committee should play a key role in this regard and should meet regularly with the goal of correcting any problems as they arise.   4. Publicity/interface with the community   It is critically important to undertake an information campaign to inform the people of Sierra Leone about the mandate and modus operandi of the Special Court both before, and once it is, operational. Sierra Leoneans will need to understand how the Special Court will work, who it will prosecute, and its relationship with the TRC (once defined). Once the Special Court is operational, there will need to be a concerted effort to keep the people of Sierra Leone informed on the progress of cases. It is important that Sierra Leoneans also understand the mixed-nature of the Special Court-that it is not just an effort of the international community, but a process with which Sierra Leoneans are integrally involved.   We hope these comments are useful to your work. Thank you for your consideration.   Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Executive Director Africa Division  Richard Dicker Director International Justice Program   [1] Article 14 of the Special Court's Statute provides that """"[t]he Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda obtaining at the time of the establishment of the Special Court shall be applied mutates mutandis to the conduct of the legal proceedings before the Special Court."""" The Special Court judges may thereafter amend those rules. See Articles 14.1-14.2.   [2] For instance, as to training regarding child witnesses, the training should include information on the juvenile justice standards contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, and the U.N. Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty. In particular, training should emphasize the best interest of the child standard and the child's right to have his or her privacy respected at all stages of a proceeding.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, United Nations"

The law allows the chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Force to detain anyone if there is a basis to assume that he or she """"takes part in hostile activity against Israel, directly or indirectly"""" or """"belongs to a force engaged in hostile activity against the State of Israel."""" All detainees held under the law are automatically assumed to be a security threat and can be held without charge or trial as long as hostilities against Israel continue.  """"This perverse legislation disregards basic principles of international law,"""" said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"In times of armed conflict international law recognizes two categories of individuals-combatants and civilians. The new law is just another example of Israel ignoring and manipulating international legal standards to suit its own purposes.""""  The new law also enables the military to hold individuals arbitrarily and indefinitely, on the basis of assumption rather than proven guilt. Detainees can be held for up to fourteen days without access to a lawyer and have limited choice of counsel. Judicial reviews are to be held in camera, using secret evidence unavailable to the detainee. A detainee may appeal his or her continued detention to the Supreme Court. But, based on similar appeals lodged in the cases of administrative detainees, the court hardly ever queries a military decision to detain an individual. One of the main reasons for the passing of this law is apparently an effort to legalize the continued detention as hostages of Sheikh 'Abd al-Karim 'Obeid (abducted from Lebanon in July 1989) and Mustafa al-Dirani (abducted from Lebanon in May 1994). Both 'Obeid and al-Dirani have been held as """"bargaining chips"""" for the return of Israeli soldiers missing in action in Lebanon. In April 2000, the High Court of Justice ruled that Israel could not continue to detain Lebanese nationals solely to serve as hostages for the return of missing soldiers in Lebanon. Thirteen such hostages were released after the ruling, but 'Obeid and al-Dirani have remained in detention.  In June 2000, an earlier draft version of the """"illegal combatant"""" law was introduced in the Knesset but came under intense local and international criticism. The new law was re-introduced in the Knesset in February 2002, shortly after US attempts to treat Taleban and al-Qaeda forces as """"unlawful combatants"""" and automatically deny them Prisoner of War protections.  Megally said the law would be applied retroactively to continue the illegal detention as hostages of 'Obeid and al-Dirani.","Europe/Central Asia, Spain, Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Women's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Human Rights Watch researchers visited dozens of villages and communities across northern Afghanistan, from Faryab province in the northwest to Baghlan province in the north-central mountains. They documented more than 150 separate incidents of violence and looting over the past three months, some occurring as recently as late February 2002, and found many Pashtun villages looted in their entirety. A comprehensive report on Human Rights Watch's findings will be issued in the near future.    Testimonies    Killing of at least twenty-seven Pashtun civilians and looting in Chimtal districtH., a sixteen year old ethnic Pashtun woman from the Pashtun village of Bargah-e Afghani, located in the Chimtal district of Balkh province, witnessed the beating and killing of her seventy-year-old father, Safter Bay, and her twenty-six-year-old brother, Amir Khan, by armed men of the Hazara ethnicity in early December 2001. At least twenty-seven, and possibly as many as thirty-seven, Pashtun villagers were killed by the group on the same day in this village. She was interviewed by Human Rights Watch on February 26, 2002.    Six men came to our house, they were Hazaras. When they entered into the house, they beat us and looted our household goods. When they were beating my father, I was holding him, trying to stop them from killing him. They beat me [back] with their weapons. The beating lasted for about one and one half hours. Amir Khan, my brother, was also there. They also held him and were beating him. They tied their hands behind their backs, and their feet were also tied. They had bruises all over their bodies.    The Hazaras were asking us for 2,000 to 3,000 lakhs [200 to 300 million Afghanis, worth about U.S. $1,700 to $2,500]. If we didn't pay the money, they would kill [my father and brother].    I saw the killing. At first, they beat them with their weapons, very forcefully. Then they shot them with about thirty bullets. Then they fired at them with [a heavier weapon]. Amir Khan was laid down on the ground, and they stabbed him with their bayonets. … They fired at both of them at the same time, but [my father] Safter Bay only died two days later. Amir Khan died instantly. They were [shot] in the courtyard inside our compound.    Then, they entered inside our rooms and searched them. We had carpets, kilims, a sewing machine-they took all of these. Some golden coins were also taken, as well as four pairs of earrings, four rings, our clothes, six watches. But they didn't abuse us anymore. They also found 2,000 lakhs.    Gang-rape of two women, aged fourteen and thirty, in Balkh city N., a thirty year old Pashtun woman who lives in Balkh city, was gang-raped together with her fourteen year old daughter by a group of soldiers of the ethnic Hazara Hizb-i-Wahdat party, who also looted her home in late December 2001. The Hazara soldiers also beat her invalid husband unconscious. She was interviewed by Human Rights Watch on February 19, 2002.    They took all the women and girls to another room and started with my fourteen-year-old daughter. She was crying a lot and imploring them not to do this because she is a virgin. But one of the men threatened her with his gun and said he would kill her if she did not undress. She was raped three times.    The commander raped her twice, and another soldier raped her once. Then the two who were inside went out and the three who were outside came in and forced me next. I was raped five times.   Then…they tried to rape my twelve-year-old daughter. But, I resisted by keeping my arms around her while they kept trying to hit her. We cried and said that we are poor people with no enemies, so why are you doing these things to us.   The commander said, """"It is our choice. You are Talib [a member of the Taliban] and you are Pashtun.""""   I am concerned about the future of my daughters. No one will marry my daughters. There is nothing left for us; marriage and honor is gone.    Beating and looting of Pashtun civilians in Dawlatabad district M.G., a seventy-year-old ethnic Pashtun man from a Pashtun village near the town of Dawlatabad in Balkh province, was repeatedly beaten by armed Hazaras and other armed groups, and his home was looted. He also explained how past preferential treatment of his village by the Taliban, at the expense of neighboring Hazara villagers, contributed to their current insecurity. He was interviewed in his completely looted home by Human Rights Watch researchers on February 19, 2002.    Eight families were living in this area, all of them Pashtun. Four of the families have left, and four are still living here.    [Following the fall of the Taliban,] in the first four days, things were peaceful. But after four days, they came here on the pretext of searching for weapons and looted everything they found. Six or seven times they came here with their jeeps to loot.    The first time, it was around the 20th or 25th day of Ramadan [December 5 to December 10, 2001]. They came at night. About ten or fifteen people came in two Datsuns. They were [ethnically] mixed, most from Dawlatabad, some from elsewhere. They looted everything. At first they beat all of the population living here, and then they looted all of our possessions, like carpets, pots, household goods. They also broke the boxes [used to store valuables.]    From my family, they took twelve carpets, anything from the house, such as teapots, jewelry, earrings, kilims, 2 or 3 bokhars of wheat, flour, 121 sirs of rice. Four cows were seized in the second attack.    During the first attack, about twelve thieves entered. They were beating me with whips, telling me to show them my money. They were saying that we were Pashtun, they were using bad words. They also hit me with their weapons, they kicked me, and punched me with their fists. The beating lasted for about one hour. Then, they twisted my penis and testicles, trying to get me to show them where I had hidden the money. Then I lost consciousness from the pain. When I woke up, I saw that no-one was left here, and that nothing was left in my home. …    Two nights later, there was a second attack. It was some of the same people, and some others. Again, we were looted. That time, they beat me, my wife, and my children. Any time they came, they would punch me and tie my hands, then they would kick me and beat me with their weapons, and ask for money.    They collected all of the women in a room. Then they broke their boxes [where valuables are kept] and took the jewelry from the boxes. When some of the women began to cry, they beat them. They were kicking the women and saying bad words to them.    The most recent attack was twenty days ago, it came from the neighboring village. That village wants 3,000 lakhs [300 million Afghanis, worth about U.S. $2,500] from all of the villagers, that is why some of the villagers have left. We are left here, and cannot go out. The other village, Sar-i-De, is a Hazara village. The Taliban had taken my land, and told me to go farm this land, which belongs to the Hazara people. So now, the Hazara people estimate the harvest was 3,000 lakhs because I farmed on their land. But I harvested about 40 bokhars of wheat, worth 800 lakhs. I only harvested there for one season, because of the drought.    We were five farmers in the village, and had about 200 dunams of land. It was occupied by the [Taliban] government and they were farming it. The government ordered us to farm this [Hazara] land for one year. … I once fought against the Taliban, and they beat me black and blue.    I don't know how to resolve this conflict. I have no way other than to sell my house to settle this. They are threatening me every time [I go out.] I am imprisoned here [in my house.] Right now, if I leave here, they will come and steal even the windows and cut my trees.    Extortion, Beating and Shooting of Pashtun civilian in Balkh city A.K., a thirty-four year old ethnic Pashtun man from a Pashtun village near Balkh city in Balkh province, was beaten and shot by armed ethnic Hazara soldiers of the Hizb-i Wahdat militia after he refused to give them money. He was still bedridden and recovering from gunshot wounds when interviewed at his home by Human Rights Watch researchers on February 18, 2002.    Before the shooting, two or three days before, the Hazaras who shot me came to my house, demanding money. They had bought a tractor, and needed money to pay for it. I refused to [give them money.] I guess this created the problem-they wanted to punish me for refusing to give them money. When they arrested me at the market, they said 'Right now, we will settle things.'    It was about ten days ago, a Thursday. We have two market days, Monday and Thursday, and it was a market day. It was about 11 a.m. I was riding my bicycle, and they stopped me by the jeep. They were three people, they belonged to Hizb-i Wahdat. At first, they told me that they had some work for me. When I stopped my bike, they pushed down on my bike and made me fall down.    They then ordered me to get in the jeep. When I got in the vehicle, they beat me with their fists and kicked me. They also beat me with the guns. [As we were driving,] I freed my hands and opened the door of the jeep and ran away near the cotton factory. When I ran away, they shot in front of me. Then they shot me near the ear. Then they also hit me in the neck. I screamed to alert the other villagers. When the villagers got alerted, they started shooting at the Hazaras. The Hazaras stopped chasing me and then I was rescued.    Beatings of Pashtun civilians and Theft in the Shoor Darya region of Faryab province A.M., forty-eight-year-old ethnic Pashtun man from a Pashtun village in the Shoor Darya region of Faryab province, was jailed, beaten and robbed by Uzbek commanders belonging to Junbish-i-Milli-yi Islami when he returned home from fifteen months of refuge in Iran on December 15, 2001. He was interviewed by Human Rights Watch researchers on February 21, 2002.    When the Taliban [government] fell, I was [a refugee] in Iran. I came home from Iran by way of [the Afghan city of] Herat. There was no man in my home, except for my cousin, and this is why I came home.    Three men from Juma Bazaar [an area of Faryab province] were in power in Dowlatabad, their names are R, W, and T. When they saw me [arrive in Dowlatabad], they arrested me and took my money, around 500,000 Iranian Toman [5 million Iranian Rial, worth about U.S. $840].   It was one day before [the Muslim feast day of] Eid, the thirtieth day of Ramadan [December 15, 2001], that they arrested and jailed me. I was in Dowlatabad that day, coming from Iran. I got off the vehicle and they caught me because they knew I had money. I also had an Iranian blanket and some presents, so they understood I came from Iran.   When I got off [the bus], three armed persons arrested me and beat me with their weapons. Then they pulled me to the prison. There, they took my bag. My money was in the bag. They also took about 100 lakhs [10 million Afghanis, worth about U.S. $83] worth of presents that were in my bag.    At the prison that night, [commanders] T and W came. They poured some water on my back. Then they started beating me with wooden sticks for a long time. They warned me not to tell anyone that they had stolen my money. They beat me for about four hours like this. I was jailed for five more nights like this.    … Just today, an Uzbek came to one of our elders. He told the Hadji [honorary title for an elder who has gone on the Haj pilgrimage] that the elders have to pay about twenty lakhs [20 million Afghanis, worth about 16 U.S. dollars] to him. Otherwise, they would beat or jail us. [Two Uzbek men quickly left the village when the Human Rights Watch team arrived.]    A.S., a forty-six-year-old ethnic Pashtun from a Pashtun village in the Shoor Darya region of Faryab province, was severely beaten and robbed by armed members of the ethnic Uzbek party, Junbish-i-Milli-yi Islami after the fall of the Taliban. He remains bedridden from his injuries, and may not recover. He was interviewed by Human Rights Watch researchers on February 22, 2002.    When the Taliban fell, all of the Uzbek villagers from Faizabad [the capital of Faryab province, located over the mountains from the village] came to invade the village and looted everything. I was a rich man here-I owned 120 sheep, two camels, two cows, two donkeys, and one motorbike. Now, I cannot even claim back the money that Uzbeks have borrowed from me [prior to the fall of the Taliban]. Right now, I am begging food from the other villagers.    It was from the first days of Ramadan that it started. They came not just for one day, the looting lasted for more than twenty days during Ramadan. This village was a rich village, and for that reason thieves would come day and night. One group would leave and others would come.    I know the thieves who stole 100 lakhs [10 million Afghanis, worth about U.S. $83] from me. One is N., son of Khalai, he is from Khobe Sayat village. The other is S., son of Nurbi. They both belong to Junbish[-i-Milli-yi Islami]. It is two months since they beat me, but I am still in bed.    The day I was beaten, we were two people coming from the city. It was during Ramadan, the last days of Ramadan. I was [coming from] feeding my sheep and returning to my home. It was around one or two p.m. Two people came on motorbikes, it was S. and N.    At first they choked me with a turban. I lost consciousness, and they tied my hands. Then they started beating me, they beat me with a kardoom, a cable with a metal ball at the end. I can't remember how many times they hit me, on my back, my legs, my hands. They broke my arm with the kardoom. The beating lasted for about one hour. Then they brought me on their motorbikes to my home, and I paid them the money [they had demanded] and gave them my motorbike. They ordered me, either you give money or we will kill you. I told them, """"I will give you money, please don't kill me.""""","Asia, Afghanistan","Children's Rights, Women's Rights"

On Monday, March 4, the government of Uzbekistan registered the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan (IHROU), giving the group legal status to operate in the country. Finally, a decade after independence from the Soviet Union, the government has recognized the legitimacy of a truly independent local human rights organization,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. The IHROU, headed by Mikhail Dmitrivich Ardzinov, was founded in 1996. Since its establishment, the Uzbek government had repeatedly refused to legally register the group, thereby consigning it to the status of an illegal organization.  In recent months, the Bush administration had made registration of rights groups a priority in its relations with Uzbekistan. The administration has also asked Uzbek officials to register another independent rights group, the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan """"Ezgulik,"""" which is also preparing to apply for legal status. President Islam Karimov is due to visit the United States for a meeting with President Bush on March 12.  """"This shows that the U.S. government has leverage and can achieve real successes when it chooses to use that leverage,"""" said Andersen, """"But it should be the first in a series of steps by the Uzbek government to show the U.S. and the rest of the international community whether it is committed to making genuine progress in human rights.""""  The IHROU's lack of legal status has been used by authorities as a pretext for the harassment, physical mistreatment, and imprisonment of its members. IHROU member Makhbuba Kasimova, a former schoolteacher and mother of five children, who researched abuses against independent Muslims, was jailed in July 1999 on spurious charges that she hid a criminal in her home. At her 15-minute trial, the prosecutor charged specifically that she was a member of an """"illegal organization."""" The court sentenced her to five years in prison. She was released on the order of President Karimov in December 2000 as the result of an international campaign on her behalf and concerted U.S. government pressure to gain her freedom.  Kasimova's colleague, Ismail Adylov, was also imprisoned on false charges in August 1999, and released in July 2001. In a visit to the United States this past November to be honored by Human Rights Watch, Adylov recounted the torture and humiliation he had experienced in prison and vowed to continue his work on behalf of those who remained in custody.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

In a rare oral briefing to the members of the U.N. Security Council by a non-governmental organization, Human Rights Watch today urged that the Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) play an enhanced role in taking responsibility for more than four million displaced persons inside Angola, an extension of the agency's traditional responsibility only for refugees who have crossed an international border.  The Angolan government has also failed to make public any significant data concerning its oil revenues, which totaled U.S.$3.18 billion in 2001. Human Rights Watch said that disclosing such data would have a positive effect on governance and could lay the foundations for improvement in human rights, and it urged the Security Council to press the Angolan government for such disclosure.  The death of UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi may create new opportunities for making peace in Angola, Human Rights Watch said. “Savimbi’s death has drawn new attention to the millions of victims of the civil war in Angola,” said Arvind Ganesan, Director of the Business and Human Rights program at Human Rights Watch. “The Security Council should not let this moment pass.”  Human rights abuse and violence against civilians in Angola have been increasing since the fighting resumed in 1998, Human Rights Watch said. Angola is the second largest oil producer in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001, more than 90 percent of the government’s budget came from oil revenue. Yet the country ranks 146 out of 162 countries in the United Nations Development Program’s latest Human Development Index. Humanitarian aid only reaches approximately 10 to 15 percent of the country, around the major provincial towns.  More than four million people, or 31 percent of the total population, are internally displaced in Angola. Both the government and UNITA have forced people from their homes in order to depopulate areas, or to punish locals for their perceived support of the adversary.  Two obstacles to protecting these internally displaced people (IDPs) in Angola are the failure of the United Nations to monitor individual cases of abuses, and its apparent unwillingness to confront the Angolan government directly on the issue of IDPs, Human Rights Watch said.  In areas held by UNITA, humanitarian access is virtually nonexistent. UNITA also continues to lay landmines to prevent residents of areas under their control from fleeing to government-controlled areas. It has also used anti-vehicle mines to disrupt transportation.  There have been some improvements in the human rights situation in Angola in recent months, Human Rights Watch said. In areas under firm government control such as Luanda and along the coast, there is more tolerance of discussions about human rights and public affairs. However, this has not included greater tolerance of organized political activities or detailed discussion on how the government manages its oil and diamond revenues.  The opacity of the Angolan government’s budget and expenditures has generated widespread concern, including among the multilateral financial institutions. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) tried to address this problem by entering into a program of economic reform with the government in April 2000. This program included a provision to monitor oil revenues, known as the “Oil Diagnostic,” which could have promoted transparency and accountability and ultimately a greater respect for human rights. However, the government has failed to implement the program effectively.  “Public accounting for oil revenues is something that is firmly within the government’s control, even in the absence of peace,” said Ganesan.  Human Rights Watch is testifying before the Security Council in an Arria Formula briefing. An Arria Formula meeting is a meeting of the members of the Council rather than a meeting of the Security Council per se. It allows Council members to hear the views of representatives of non-Council members, representatives of non-state parties and NGOs in an informal and confidential setting. It is held outside of council chambers and is restricted to members of the Council and representatives of parties whose views the Council seeks.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/04/us-state-department-rights-reports-critique","US State Department Rights Reports Critique","U.S. State Department Rights Reports Critique","","03/04/2002","(Washington) - This year's State Department Human Rights Reports are largely candid and accurate, Human Rights Watch said today, while urging the Bush Administration to apply the reports' findings to coming policy decisions.   The reports single out countries like China and Russia for using the war on terrorism to legitimize repression, and honestly describe abuses committed by U.S. allies such as Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. An exception is the Colombia chapter, which appears to inflate the military's progress in cutting ties with paramilitary groups to set the stage for certifying compliance with Congressional human rights conditions.   The reports also forthrightly acknowledge that terrorists gain adherents in countries where human rights are denied and civil liberties are repressed.   """"The Administration argues forcefully in this report that defending human rights is vital to fighting terrorism,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"That argument needs to be reflected in the alliances it is forging, the money it is spending, and the bases it is building overseas.""""   """"For the most part, the State Department deserves credit for pulling no punches,"""" he added. """"But a human rights report is not by itself a human rights policy.""""   Colombia: The State Department must soon certify whether Colombia is cutting ties to paramilitary groups to continue military aid under Plan Colombia. This year's report uses dubious statistics to make general claims of progress. Yet a close reading reveals factual information that contradicts those claims. For example, the report cites increased arrests of paramilitaries to argue that the government's record is improving, yet elsewhere it acknowledges that """"top paramilitary leaders largely remained beyond the reach of the law"""" and that the paramilitary presence in Colombia dramatically expanded in 2001. It claims the military has transferred hundreds of cases involving officers to civilian courts, yet it elsewhere concedes """"there was no information available as to how many of these cases dealt specifically with human rights.""""   Uzbekistan: The State Department must certify that Uzbekistan is making progress on human rights to continue assistance under the Nunn-Lugar program. The report offers scant evidence of progress. It notes the government's persecution of independent human rights organizations and banned political parties, its control over the media, and use of censorship and criminal libel. It relates with laudable accuracy the routine use of torture, including electric shock, beatings, rape, and asphyxiation, and the police practice of taking relatives of suspects into custody as hostages. It falls short, however, in labeling the government's multi-year campaign of arrest, torture, incarceration, and extrajudicial execution of independent Muslims as a """"restriction"""" on religion rather than persecution. While acknowledging that members of Islamic groups are targeted by the police, it fails to highlight the thousands of religious Muslim prisoners who were jailed for their beliefs and who were not members of any organized group. While noting that a number of political and religious prisoners were recently amnestied, it neglects to mention that to qualify for the amnesty prisoners had to renounce their faith and pay a bribe - and that those who refused suffered even worse treatment than before.   Prior to the March 12 summit between President Bush and Uzbek leader Islam Karimov, the administration should call on its Central Asian partner to make concrete concessions in the area of human rights, including the release of prominent political prisoners and the registration of human rights groups. U.S. decisions on aid and the nature of its military presence in Uzbekistan should take into account its responsiveness to these concerns.   Afghanistan: The report is strong on Taliban human rights violations, but gives too little attention to abuses by the Northern Alliance before and after September 11. Since coming to power in Northern Afghanistan, the armed elements of the Northern Alliance have committed severe abuses - including widespread looting, murder, beatings, and sexual violence - against Pashtun civilians in Northern Afghanistan. This pattern of abuses by Northern Alliance forces, which is not mentioned in the report, argues strongly for an expanded international security presence in the country.   The material on the Taliban is strong enough to suggest that the U.S. should be actively pressing within the Security Council for the establishment of a Commission of Experts to gather evidence for possible future prosecutions.   China: The report on China is at least as hard-hitting as last year's. In 2000, the State Department said that China's human rights record had """"worsened"""" with a tightening of controls on dissent across the board. Today's report says that it has """"remained poor"""" with """"numerous and serious abuses,"""" which are documented in great detail. The State Department notes in several places that abuses in Xinjiang, the far northwestern predominantly Muslim province, were particularly severe, including the targeting of the """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign against so-called separatists, mass sentencing rallies and many executions. Its analysis of religious freedom overall is characterized in almost identical terms as last year's, noting that unofficial religious groups suffer """"official interference, harassment and repression"""" and detailing abuses of religious freedom in Tibet. Based on this report, the administration should immediately begin a high level diplomatic effort to censure China at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva later this month. Even without a seat, the US can work to identify an original sponsor of a China resolution, add its own support and urge other governments to back it.   The introduction to the full report also acknowledges the Chinese government's attempt to equate Uighur calls for autonomy or independence, no matter how peaceful, with international terrorism. President Bush should use the upcoming visit of Vice President Hu Jintao to Washington in late April to convey this concern publicly and privately. The U.S. should also resist requests to turn over to China any Uighurs captured in Afghanistan.   Indonesia: Despite numerous errors, omissions, and sloppy editing, the Indonesia chapter underscores how poor the human rights record of the military and police continues to be. Not only do extrajudicial executions, torture, and arbitrary detention continue, particularly in areas such as Aceh and Papua, but the military continues to enjoy near total impunity. To restore unrestricted military-to-military aid under such circumstances, as some in the Bush administration are proposing, would be to effectively reward the security forces for bad behavior.   Russia: The report describes candidly the continued violence and abuse by Russian forces against the civilian population in Chechnya, even if it mildly underestimates the near-total impunity for such crimes. The administration should use the information contained in the report at the upcoming U.N. Commission on Human Rights to press for accountability and the establishment of an official record of the crimes committed during the conflict, and to ensure access to international human rights monitors, including those under U.N. mandates, to Chechnya. The Administration should use the period before the May Bush-Putin summit to seek firm human rights commitments from Russia.   Federal Republic of Yugoslavia: The report forthrightly notes that """"[w]ith the exception of the transfer of Slobodan Milosevic and a few other war criminals, the Government's cooperation with the Yugoslav War Crimes Tribunal (ICTY) decreased significantly during the year. [...] [A]t year's end, several indictees remained at liberty, and, in at least one case, still in an official position in Serbia."""" It states that the FRY government """"has been uncooperative in requests for documents regarding crimes committed by Serbs against other ethnic groups, and in arranging interviews with official and nongovernmental witnesses."""" The Secretary of State should use the upcoming March 31 cut-off date for U.S. assistance to the FRY government to press for full cooperation by the FRY government with the ICTY. The administration, too, should signal to Belgrade and beyond that it values international justice, and overcome perceptions that it does not fully support the tribunal's work.   Saudi Arabia: The State department harshly assesses Saudi Arabia's rights record as """"poor,"""" in stark contrast with the warm bi-lateral relations that exist with the U.S. Saudi Arabia has a seat on the UN Human Rights Commission, and has signed onto the major human rights conventions, including the Convention Against Torture. However, the State Department review shows the Kingdom is regularly violating rights that it has pledged to uphold as a party to these treaties. The Kingdom lacks essential building blocks for civil society, including any independent institutions, women's or political groups - the report says there are """"no active women's rights groups"""" in the country. Torture and abuse of detainees is widespread. The US should push for greater freedom of association and long-term permission for international rights groups to monitor conditions in the Kingdom (Saudi Arabia regularly """"invites"""" human rights groups to monitor, with permission to visit never materializing). Joining the World Trade Organization is one of the Saudi regime's top objectives and should be leveraged for concrete rights progress.   Israel/Palestinian Authority: The Israel/P.A. report is comprehensive and describes many human rights abuses over the past year, particularly the large number of violent attacks on civilians. In both Israel and the P.A., the human rights record is accurately described as """"poor."""" A major weakness of this report is that there is very little reference to human rights or humanitarian law standards. The US should ask Israel to adopt non-lethal responses to unarmed demonstrators and conduct serious and impartial investigations into Palestinian deaths resulting from alleged wrongful IDF actions. The U.S. should ask the Palestinian Authority to establish a clear chain of command and enforce effective standards of conduct and accountability for all armed personnel. Finally, the P.A. should take concrete and effective steps to halt Palestinian armed attacks against Israeli civilians.   Congo: The chapter is detailed and balanced in documenting abuses by the government and the rebels. However, it remains largely silent on the legal status of the Ugandan and Rwandan forces in eastern Congo, failing to qualify it as an occupation, and says little about their conduct. The report emphasizes the security interests that the two governments cite in justifying their involvement in the Congo war, while failing to adequately portray their economic interests in plundering all forms of wealth from Congo. These shortcomings correspond to the failure of the U.S. government to hold the Ugandan and Rwandan governments responsible for their actions in the DRC, notably the grave violations of international humanitarian law and massive human suffering taking place in territories under their occupation. As the occupying powers, under international law they must protect civilians and stop these killings.   Nigeria: The report provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the poor human rights situation in Nigeria. However, it does not adequately indicate the Nigerian government's responsibility to investigate and prosecute serious human rights abuses. The report notes numerous killings by the security forces and other violence during inter-communal conflicts, but does not stress the government's continuing failure to investigate these abuses or take preventive action. While appropriately describing the killing of civilians in October in Benue state as """"the year's most egregious case,"""" the report goes on to attribute the killings in part to a lack of training. In fact, this incident was a well-organized reprisal operation following the abduction and killing of nineteen soldiers by an armed group. The U.S. should ensure that any future assistance to the Nigerian security forces be linked to measurable progress in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the killings and destruction in Benue in 2001, as well as the killing and destruction in Odi in 1999.  Analogies to U.S. Policies: To its credit, the reports continue to criticize the practice of detaining suspects without charge in countries such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, China and Malaysia, as well as the prosecution of civilians in military courts without adequate due process. America's ability to complain about such abuses will be undercut, however, if its response to terrorism at home does not reflect the standards championed by the State Department abroad.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Afghanistan, China and Tibet, Indonesia, Russia, Serbia/Kosovo, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Israel/Palestine, Saudi Arabia, US Foreign Policy",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/03/04/bush-policy-endangers-american-and-allied-troops","Bush Policy Endangers American and Allied Troops","Bush Policy Endangers American and Allied Troops","","03/04/2002","NEW YORK The Bush administration thinks it deserves congratulations for its recent decision to apply the Geneva conventions to some of its prisoners from Afghanistan. The decision appears to reverse public statements by Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and even President George W. Bush himself that the detainees in its Guantánamo Bay base in Cuba didn't merit protection under the laws of war. Rumsfeld last week outlined an uncertain future for the hundreds of prisoners of the Afghan war being held in Cuba, saying that they might be returned to their own countries or held indefinitely to prevent them from taking up arms again. The United States holds 300 men from 26 countries in captivity at the Guantánamo base, as well as 194 men in Afghanistan itself. But the new policy of the Bush administration on the prisoners in Cuba is no more than smoke and mirrors. In fact, the White House is manipulating the conventions in selective and highly political ways: Bush has said that Taliban detainees will not be granted their prisoner-of-war rights under the conventions, and that Al Qaeda detainees won't be covered by the conventions at all. Such flouting of the laws of war does more than threaten to violate the detainees' rights to suit the administration's preferences. It endangers American troops - and the armed forces of U.S. allies - who might some day find themselves captured in combat. To justify this shredding of a widely ratified treaty, the White House has tried to suggest that the Guantánamo detainees pose novel and difficult questions of international law. But its arguments don't hold up. First, the White House says that the Third Geneva Convention on prisoners of war does not cover members of Al Qaeda because they are terrorists, not government troops. But the convention expressly applies to all combatants captured in the course of an international armed conflict, regardless of how they are characterized. Second, the White House asserts that Taliban fighters, whom it does admit are covered by the convention, do not qualify for POW status because they allegedly failed to wear distinctive insignia and abide by the laws of war. But the convention states that the members of the armed forces of an enemy government are automatically entitled to POW status. By manufacturing this new test for government troops, Bush hands enemy forces a ready excuse for denying POW status to captured American and allied troops. One can easily imagine Saddam Hussein, for example, using the administration's argument to deny POW status to a captured American pilot by asserting that U.S. bombing violated the laws of war, or to deny POW status to captured American special forces who were operating undercover, without distinctive insignia. Using the administration's argument, India could cite Pakistan's alleged support for terrorism to deny its soldiers POW status. Syria could deny captured Israeli soldiers POW status by saying that they have attacked civilians in Lebanon. The Geneva conventions were designed precisely to avoid those kinds of subjective judgments by warring parties who hate each other. Contrary to the administration's claims, granting POW status to Taliban fighters would not disrupt legitimate U.S. efforts to interrogate terrorist suspects. Similarly, POW status prohibits prosecution only for lawful attacks on opposing military forces. Still permitted are prosecutions for war crimes or attacks on civilians, whether before or during the conflict. If a POW is prosecuted for such offenses, the duty to repatriate him at the end of hostilities would take effect only after any sentence had been served. So why is the administration refusing to apply the Geneva conventions' straightforward rules? Probably to ensure that even the small number of Taliban detainees in Guantánamo can be tried by Bush's controversial military commissions. The convention entitles POWs to the same trial procedures as the detaining power would give its own service members facing similar charges - that is, a court-martial. Maybe the administration is afraid its case wouldn't be strong enough to hold up before a court-martial. But that risks substituting vengeance for justice. Apart from protecting POWs, the Geneva conventions also contain the most broadly accepted international prohibitions against waging war by attacking civilians - that is, terrorism. To suggest that certain causes justify setting the conventions aside is to accept the ends-justify-the-means logic of terrorism. That is surely the Bush administration's most serious mistake of all.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial"

The ongoing campaign of violence and intimidation is forcing thousands of Pashtuns to leave their villages. Over the last four weeks, teams from Human Rights Watch have visited over two dozen villages and communities across northern Afghanistan, from Faryab province in the northwest to Baghlan in the north central mountains. They have documented over 150 separate incidents of violence and looting over the last three months, some of them as recent as this week. The testimony of Pashtuns across this large area was consistent in its depiction of violence, looting, and intimidation at the hands of local commanders. The research teams interviewed dozens of Afghan villagers and community leaders, all of whom said they wanted a greater international security presence. They also wanted local political factions disarmed. Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. Security Council to expand the mandate for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan to include areas outside of Kabul. """"The only way this violence is going to be checked in the short term is by the presence of international troops,"""" said Peter Bouckaert, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"The Pashtuns in the north need protection now - they can't wait for a national army to be trained."""" The three political factions active in the north are the Junbish-i Milli-yi Islami, Jamiat-e Islami, and Hizb-i Wahdat, drawn largely from the Uzbek, Tajik, and Hazara ethnic groups respectively. Since the fall of the Taliban, each group has targeted the Pashtun community in areas under its control, partly in reprisal for these communities' real or perceived association with the predominantly Pashtun Taliban movement, and partly as a result of political competition in northern Afghanistan. The abuses have also occurred in a broader context of violence by armed groups, in which Pashtuns -- lacking political and military power in the north -- are acutely vulnerable. A typical pattern for these attacks emerged from the testimony of villagers in the Shoor Darya region of Faryab province. They reported that armed Uzbeks associated with the local Junbish faction took away their guns (but not those of other ethnic groups) in mid-November and proceeded to loot the villages thoroughly, violently taking livestock, stored grains, household goods, money and jewelry over the course of the next few weeks - a period one villager described as """"forty days of terror."""" Villagers around Aibak, the capital of Samangan porvince, described an ongoing practice of detention and extortion of local Pashtuns by armed men linked with Junbish. Junbish is not the only political faction whose gunmen have targeted Pashtuns. Some of the most violent attacks occurred in the Chimtal district of Balkh province, where Hizb-i Wahdat forces were involved in several execution-style murders of Pashtun villagers. In Baghlan province Tajiks belonging to the Jamiat faction looted Pashtun homes in Nahrin district and the Kilagai valley. Human Rights Watch also received testimony about widely prevalent sexual violence and abduction of women in northern Afghanistan. The testimony was especially striking because of social taboos against discussing such issues. While many women were subject to violence due to the general insecurity in the north, Pashtun women seemed especially singled out for attacks. In central Balkh province, Wahdat and Junbish factions targeted Pashtun women for sexual violence, after women in their own communities suffered similar attacks in the past. In some areas the most severe violence has subsided. But Human Rights Watch encountered several serious recent incidents of looting and violence in northern Afghanistan. Commanders whose forces were associated with the abuses in Faryab were subsequently removed by Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, an action that appears to have contributed to a decrease in violence against local Pashtuns, but in other areas, abusive commanders and forces continued to act without restraint or reprimand. Violence is also acute in areas where political factions are currently contesting authority, for instance in and around Mazar-i Sharif, where all three political groups are active. """"The factions clearly can stop the abuses by their local troops when they choose to,"""" Bouckaert said. """"But given their past record, it would be foolhardy to rely on them to restore security and protect human rights."""" The interim authority's capacity for addressing the violence is also limited. In a positive development, Hamid Karzai, the chairman of Afghanistan's Interim Administration, last week appointed a three-person independent commission to investigate claims of discrimination against ethnic minorities in northern Afghanistan. Some initial missteps nothwithstanding, commission members appeared to be taking their fact-finding task very seriously, but it remained unclear what impact their work would have. Human Rights Watch warned that the anti-Pashtun violence could threaten the success of refugee repatriation. It could also undermine the Loya Jirga process, by which the interim authority will be replaced with a more permanent government. Under the Bonn Agreement, an emergency Loya Jirga or assembly will meet in June 2002. That body will choose a head of state to lead Afghanistan until a more representative government can be elected. Human Rights Watch intends to release a fuller report of its findings in northern Afghanistan in the near future.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

In a letter to Security Council members, Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the application of targeted financial and travel sanctions to individuals, and urged that guidelines for applying such sanctions include respect for basic human rights.  The U.N. Security Council is discussing how to apply sanctions that were enacted in the aftermath of September 11. Those sanctions impose financial and travel restrictions on a loosely defined category of individuals and entities whose names are provided by governments, and who have no right of review or appeal.  """"Sanctions can be an important tool for ending serious human rights abuse,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But they shouldn't be a tool for governments to punish their enemies unfairly. The United Nations must explicitly recognize due-process rights when it sets up a sanctions regime.""""  Human Rights Watch said that targeted sanctions against individuals or other entities are often preferable to generalized sanctions because they entail less suffering for civilians.  """"The United Nations is right to move toward targeted sanctions,"""" said Roth. """"But it must be meticulous in how they are applied.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the U.N. Security Council to establish clear rules under which the names of individuals can be placed on the list, to establish a clear mechanism for appeal and clear guidelines for review, and to clarify the conditions to be fulfilled for eventual removal of names from lists.  In applying the measures foreseen by resolutions 1267, 1333, and 1390 to individual citizens, the Council should ensure that the basic due-process rights of these individuals are guaranteed, in particular the right to equality before the law, the right to be informed of the reasons for the sanction or restriction imposed, the right to prepare a defense, the right to be heard, the right to challenge evidence, and the right to obtain a review.","Global","United Nations"

""""This is an ominous move from a country that's been one of the freest in Asia,” said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. “Thailand's reputation internationally and in the region will suffer if the Thai government doesn't reinstate the visas of the two FEER journalists.""""  The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects, under article 19, everyone's right to """"seek, receive and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print..."""" Thailand is a party to the covenant.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about a statement yesterday by Thai police that they are considering banning distribution of The Economist, a British magazine, because the latest edition contains an article about the royal family that may be """"offensive.”  Rodney Tasker and Shawn Crispin, correspondents for the Review based in Bangkok, had their visas cancelled on February 22 because of an article published in the magazine's January 10th (cover date) edition describing tensions between Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and Thailand's king, Bhumibol Adulyadej.  Following its publication, the Review received a letter from the Commander of the Police Special Branch Bureau 2 claiming that the article was """"a possible threat to peace and morality of the people"""" under Thailand's Print Act of 1941. However, the visas were revoked under the Thai Immigration Act on the grounds that the two reporters were deemed a threat to national security. The decision is being appealed to the Thailand Immigration Committee, chaired by the interior minister.  “Thailand will seriously damage its reputation and undermine its commitment to international human rights if these two respected reporters lose their work visas or are deported,” said Jendrzejczyk.  On February 27, Interior Minister Purachai Piumsombun warned that Tasker and Crispin could face criminal charges, but it was unclear under what laws they might be charged.  Thailand's 1997 constitution contains a provision outlawing criticism of the royal family: it specifies that """"no person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action.""""  Thailand's press has been considered one of the most outspoken in Southeast Asia. But the FEER case has raised questions in Thailand about Prime Minister Thaksin's unwillingness to tolerate public criticism of his government, which came into office last year, and could have a chilling effect on others in the media.","Asia, Thailand","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

On February 20, 2002, a Sudanese government helicopter attack killed seventeen civilians and injured many more at a U.N. relief food distribution location in the oilfield area of Bieh, Western Upper Nile, southern Sudan. The area had been approved by Sudan's government for relief distribution. U.N. food monitors and civilians witnessed the attack and other U.N. officials counted the dead.  “This is the latest and most deadly helicopter attack on civilians in Sudan’s eighteen-year civil war,” said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “It appears to have deliberately targeted civilians and humanitarian workers.”  The attack by two helicopters was not a mistake. According to the U.N., the helicopters hovered above the U.N. compound and fired at least five rockets at the civilians waiting for a food distribution, beside tons of food in fifty-kilo bags of grain clearly visible in the middle of the afternoon. No rebel forces were in the area at the time.  Because of this major human rights violation, on February 21, the U.S. government suspended its participation in peace efforts until the Sudanese government accounts for the incident.  “The Sudan government must have a firm response to its forces’ killing of seventeen and wounding of scores more,” said Rone. “The government’s offer, to appoint its own military to investigate, is simply not adequate.”  Human Rights Watch called on the Sudanese government to endorse the U.S. proposal for an international team to monitor allegations of violations of the Geneva Conventions. It urged the Sudan government to invite such a team to investigate the Bieh bombing.  Once the facts have been established by independent international monitors, the government should take strong steps to bring to justice those responsible, all the way up the chain of command, to prevent such abuses being repeated, Rone said.  The Sudan government had been negotiating with the U.S. with high hopes of regularizing relations. As part of these negotiations, Sen. John Danforth, the U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan for Peace, proposed that both government and rebel forces meet four tests before the U.S. would proceed any further as mediator in the conflict. The international Geneva Conventions monitoring team was to be part of the government and rebel commitment to stop attacks on civilians, the fourth and most difficult of the tests Danforth proposed.  State department officials say that Danforth emphasized to the Sudan government that it must meet all four tests. The recent attack in Western Upper Nile, however, led the U.S. government to suspend work on the Danforth initiative.","Africa, Sudan",""

Pierre-Richard Prosper, the U.S. ambassador at large for war-crimes issues, testified before the House International Relations Committee. In his statement he said that “problems” at the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia “challenge the integrity of the process.” One of the courts, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, has recently undertaken the trial of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic, the first-ever trial of a head of state for human rights crimes. On the same day as Prosper´s remarks, NATO staged a publicized raid to bring accused war criminal Radovan Karadzic before the tribunal. Human Rights Watch welcomed this step, however overdue, and urged NATO to persevere. “The Yugoslav tribunal has just begun the world´s most important criminal trial since Nuremberg,” said Richard Dicker, Director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. “The U.S. government is jeopardizing that effort. The timing of Ambassador Prosper´s statement is incomprehensible.” Ambassador Prosper called for the tribunals to be shut down by 2007-08. Dicker pointed out that the two tribunals were designed to last only for a limited period of time. In fact, the chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, in statements made to the U.N. Security Council on November 26, 2001, laid out a plan for terminating the work of the tribunals by 2008. “What´s the point of manufacturing a confrontation with allies when the US plan is virtually identical to the tribunal prosecutor´s own plan?” said Dicker. “If individual governments try to dictate what prosecutions they want done and when prosecutions should stop, then the courts´ independence suffers.” Prosper also proposed leaving less serious war-crimes cases to national courts in the region. “With so many senior indicted officials at liberty in Yugoslavia, it is folly to talk about leaving most suspects to domestic justice systems,” said Dicker. “It´s a nice idea, but the justice system in Belgrade is nowhere near ready. The same is true of the system in Kigali.” Prosper suggested that the Bush Administration would be willing to improve economic, technical, legal and logistical support to help improve domestic court systems in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. Dicker said that such assistance would surely be welcome, but it should not come at the expense of international justice. In Rwanda, Dicker noted, the government has proposed using “gacaca” trials at the local community level to try serous human rights crimes. In these trials, the accused would be “tried” in front of persons from the community. “Gacaca jurisdictions” lack adequate safeguards for the victims and the accused.” Dicker acknowledged there had been some problems in the operations of the Rwanda tribunal. Of the more than seventy indictees at the Rwanda Tribunal, nine have been tried and seventeen are currently on trial. Of eighty individuals who have been indicted at the Yugoslav Tribunal, thirty-one have been tried and twelve are currently on trial. “Of course these tribunals have not operated without problems, and those problems are no secret to people who follow the tribunals´ work,” said Dicker. “But Pierre Prosper didn´t seem interested in making the tribunals function better. He seems to want to tear them apart, and that would be a very serious mistake.”","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

In a 51-page report, Human Rights Watch details a series of military sweep operations during which it found hundreds of men were arbitrarily detained, dozens tortured, and at least six extrajudicially executed.  Russian forces in Chechnya arbitrarily detain, torture, and kill civilians in a climate of lawlessness, Human Rights Watch said today. In a 51-page report, Human Rights Watch details a series of military sweep operations during which it found hundreds of men were arbitrarily detained, dozens tortured, and at least six extrajudicially executed.  """"For a year now Russian authorities have been claiming that the situation in Chechnya is returning to normal,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"But in fact civilians face a daily threat of being arbitrarily detained, tortured, or just 'disappearing' in custody. That's a far cry from 'normal.'""""  The report, titled Swept Under: Torture, Forced Disappearances, and Extrajudicial Killings During Sweep Operations in Chechnya, documents abuses during sweep operations that took place in June and July 2001 in the villages Alkhan-Kala, Sernovodsk, and Assinovskaia. In a sweep operation, Russian forces, responding to Chechen rebel hostilities, typically seal off a village and run identity checks and searches of residents. The operations in mid-2001 took place against a backdrop of Russian government pledges to withdraw troops and return internally displaced persons safely to their homes, even as clashes continued between Russian forces and Chechen rebels. Since July 2001, Russian forces have conducted dozens more sweep operations throughout Chechnya, committing many of the same abuses described in the report.  Among the cases detailed is that of """"Magomed Asanukaev,""""(not the man's true name) whom Russian forces detained in the Sernovodsk sweep on July 2. They threw him in a truck with no explanation, held him in a concrete pit, and tortured him with electric shocks, attempting to coerce information about rebel fighters. He was later released, but others were not. Zelimkhan Umkhanov and Apti Isigov """"disappeared"""" after Russian forces took them into custody; relatives to this day have been unable to get information from Russian forces about their whereabouts. On June 21 Russian forces apprehended Rustam Razhepov, 35, and Daud Vitaev, 27, during the Alkhan-Kala operation; their corpses were found in an unmarked grave on June 22.  Andersen noted that a Human Rights Watch follow-up mission to the region in December discovered that the human rights situation had further deteriorated. """"Over the last six months, civilians in Chechnya have 'disappeared' at a rate of more than one every week,"""" she said. The Russian human rights group Memorial documented more than twenty """"disappearances"""" in December 2001 alone.  Meanwhile, Andersen said, Chechnya has fallen off the map in the post-September 11 foreign policy climate. """"Governments don't have the political will to make genuine accountability for crimes against civilians a benchmark for their Russia policy,"""" said Andersen. """"And this message hasn't been lost on the Kremlin. The carte blanche for violence against civilians is shattering whatever trust Chechens have had in Moscow, torpedoing peace efforts, and ultimately undermining Russia as a credible partner in the international war against terrorism.""""  The current climate of lawlessness in Chechnya, Andersen said, follows from a long-standing failure by Russian authorities to bring abusive forces to justice. Many Chechen civil servants who cooperate with Moscow threatened to quit after the summer sweep operations, prompting Moscow to acknowledge abuses and promise an investigation. The Human Rights Watch report says investigations, principally into property damage, in the Sernovodsk operation are ongoing. To date, no comprehensive investigation is under way with regard to the Alkhan-Kala sweep.  Responding to criticism about the winter sweep operations, Vladimir Kalamanov, President Putin's special representative on human rights in Chechnya said on January 31 that he was """"pleased by the pace of investigations"""" into crimes by servicemen against civilians,"""" and vowed that """"no crime would be left unpunished.""""  """"Without ongoing engagement by the international community, Russia will be able to continue issuing empty promises of justice,"""" said Andersen.  Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which will convene in March, to adopt a resolution condemning ongoing violations in Chechnya and called on Russia to allow U.N. special rapporteurs on torture and on extrajudicial executions to conduct investigations in Chechnya. Human Rights Watch also called on the Bush administration to raise the matter with the Russian government. President Bush is expected to visit Moscow in May.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/27/us-racial-disparities-incarceration","US- Racial Disparities in Incarceration","US: Racial Disparities in Incarceration","A Human Rights Watch Press Backgrounder","02/27/2002","In this briefing, we present new figures documenting racial disparities state-by-state in the incarceration of African Americans and Latinos.1 We hope they will help state residents and public officials to understand their state-specific incarceration patterns and practices. Two years ago, drawing on data from thirty-seven states, Human Rights Watch documented racial disparities in the incarceration of state drug offenders.2 Since most drug offenders are convicted of state law violations, our state-by-state analysis provided an important insight into the consequences of state policies that were masked by the more commonly available aggregate national data. The current briefing is a continuation of our effort to illuminate state-by-state the racial impact of the criminal justice system. Using data gathered by the U.S. Census Bureau for the Census 2000,3 we have been able to develop a series of charts that constitute the first published snapshot of the extent to which whites, blacks and Hispanics in each state are behind bars. These are the most up-to-date figures available based on actual correctional facility counts. The figures reveal the continuing, extraordinary magnitude of minority incarceration and the stark disparity in their rates of incarceration compared to those of whites. Out of a total population of 1,976,019 incarcerated in adult facilities, 1,239,946 or 63 percent are black or Latino, though these two groups constitute only 25 percent of the national population.4 The figures also demonstrate significant differences among the states in the extent of racial disparities. Key Findings: Incarceration of Blacks · In twelve states, between 10 and 15 percent of adult black men are incarcerated. · In ten states, between 5 and 10 percent of black adults are incarcerated. · In twelve states, black men are incarcerated at rates between twelve and sixteen times greater than those of white men. · In fifteen states, black women are incarcerated at rates between ten and thirty-five times greater than those of white women. · In six states, black youth under age eighteen are incarcerated in adult facilities at rates between twelve and twenty-five times greater than those of white youth.   Incarceration of Hispanics · In nine states, between 4 and nearly 8 percent of adult Latino men are incarcerated. · In twelve states, between 2 and 4 percent of Hispanic adults (men and women) are incarcerated. · In ten states, Latino men are incarcerated at rates between five and nine times greater than those of white men. · In eight states, Latina women are incarcerated rates that are between four and seven times greater than those of white women. · In four states, Hispanic youth under age eighteen are incarcerated in adult facilities at rates between seven and seventeen times greater than those of white youth.   In this briefing, we do not analyze the diverse reasons for these troubling statistics. Crime rates, law enforcement priorities, sentencing legislation and other factors play a role in creating racial disparities in incarceration. For example, penal policies instituted to control crime have exacerbated longstanding racial disparities in the criminal justice system.5 Sentences for violent crimes have been substantially increased through the passage of mandatory minimum sentencing laws, """"three strikes"""" laws, and truth in sentencing laws that require inmates to serve 85 percent of their sentences. Because blacks constitute a large percentage among those arrested for violent crimes (45 percent-a proportion that has not changed significantly over the years), they are disproportionately affected by the longer sentences.6 Blacks have also been disproportionately affected by the national """"war on drugs"""", carried out primarily through the arrest, prosecution and imprisonment of street level drug offenders from inner city communities. In 1996, for example, blacks constituted 62.6 percent of all drug offenders admitted to state prisons. In at least fifteen states, black men were sent to prison on drug charges at rates ranging from twenty to fifty-seven times those of white men.7 Blacks are prosecuted in federal courts more frequently than whites for crack cocaine offenses, and thus as a group have felt the effects of the longer sentences for crack versus powder cocaine mandated in federal law. Racial profiling and other forms of unequal treatment of minorities by the criminal justice system have further contributed to the overrepresentation of minorities in the incarcerated population. Minority youth are treated far more harshly compared to similarly situated white counterparts within the juvenile criminal justice system.8 As the charts in this update reveal, there are striking differences among the states in the degree of variations of racial disparities in incarceration. State criminal justice and law enforcement policies clearly play a role in creating these differences. Demographics are important as well. Some of the greatest racial disparities in rates of incarceration occur in states in which minorities are concentrated in urban areas, which tend to have both higher rates of crime and greater law enforcement activity. The high and disproportionate rate of minority incarceration in the U.S., particularly that of blacks, is a grave challenge to the country. Last year, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights warned that racial inequalities in the criminal justice system threatened to negate fifty years of hard-fought civil right progress.9 While incarceration rates reflect many race-neutral factors, racial bias or sheer indifference to the fate of minority communities has surely contributed to the development and persistence of such racially disparate rates of incarceration. States have choices in the means by which they promote community well-being and protect public safety; the choices made in recent years have levied a particularly high cost on minority communities. As crime rates have fallen and as high incarceration costs consume ever larger portions of state and county budgets, elected officials and the public in many states are beginning to debate current criminal justice policies and to consider the advantages of alternatives to incarceration. By graphically demonstrating the racial gross disparities in incarceration, we hope to contribute to a reassessment of the fairness and wisdom of over-reliance on punitive crime control measures that have disproportionately burdened the minority communities from which so large a proportion of the incarcerated are drawn. 1 The terms """"Latino"""" and """"Hispanic"""" are used interchangeably to refer collectively to Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Central and South Americans, and others of Spanish and Latin American descent. Hispanics can be of any race, though the figures for whites used in this briefing do not include white Latinos. However, the figures for blacks include black Hispanics, who are also counted as Latinos. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the estimated percentage of blacks who are also counted as Hispanics is 1-3%. Many corrections departments and local jails do not separate Latinos from other racial groups. Most assessments of the racial/ethnic breakdown of the incarcerated population have therefore had to rely on estimates derived from survey samples. 2 Human Rights Watch, """"Punishment and Prejudice: Racial Disparities in the War on Drugs,"""" A Human Rights Watch Report, vol. 12, no. 2, May 2000. 3 The U.S. Census 2000 includes data on the race, gender, number and age of residents in each of the fifty U.S states, as well as the number, race, gender and age of persons held in each state in various types of confinement facilities, including prisons, federal detention centers, military disciplinary barracks and jails, police lockups, half-way houses used for correctional purposes, local jails, work farms and others.

""""This data demonstrates clearly the marked racial disparities in the US prison population,"""" said Jamie Fellner, Human Rights Watch's US program director. """"It is astonishing that in some states, one in ten black men is behind bars."""" Among the findings: Blacks and Hispanics make up 62 percent of the incarcerated population, though comprising only 25 percent of the national population; Between ten and fifteen percent of black men are incarcerated in twelve states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming); Black women are incarcerated at rates between ten and thirty-five times greater than the rates of white women in fifteen states (Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Rhode Island, Texas, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming); and Hispanic youth are incarcerated at rates seven to seventeen times greater than those of whites in Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, while the incarceration rate for black youth is between twelve and twenty-five times greater than those of whites in Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Massachusetts, Montana, and New Jersey.

The law-first promised by President Trajkovski at the start of the peace process last fall-is expected to be introduced in Parliament today.  """"Serious violations of the laws of war have been committed by both sides to the armed conflict and accountability for those crimes has to be an essential part of the peace process,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch. """"The international tribunal can hear only a handful of cases. If the Macedonian authorities cannot hear the rest, then serious crimes like torture, murder, and attacks on civilians will go unpunished.""""  Human Rights Watch does not oppose an amnesty per se, but urged that it preserve the possibility of prosecutions of violations of international humanitarian law by either the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia or the Macedonian authorities.  The legislation was not yet publicly available, but Human Rights Watch expressed concern over reports that drafts under consideration would acknowledge the international tribunal's jurisdiction, but bar Macedonian courts from prosecuting violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity. Human Rights Watch urged President Trajkovski to oppose such legislation and not to sign it if it passes parliament with such wording.  NATO and other international actors involved in the Macedonia peace process consider the amnesty an important step toward building inter-ethnic confidence in Macedonia. But Human Rights Watch cautioned that a sweeping amnesty that prevents domestic prosecutions for violations of international humanitarian law would be counterproductive.  """"The peace will be only as strong as the justice is thorough,"""" Andersen said. """"Eliminating domestic jurisdiction over these cases would be a big mistake.""""  A Macedonia amnesty that bars national courts from hearing cases involving violations of international humanitarian law would be contrary to norms of international justice reflected in the treaty that established the International Criminal Court (ICC), expected to come into force in just a few months. The Macedonia amnesty would strip the national courts of jurisdiction, in favor of the international tribunal. By contrast, the 139 countries that have signed the ICC treaty have reinforced national courts' role as the first line of prosecution, allowing the international court to step in only where the national courts are unwilling or unable to act.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

In the 45-page report, Human Rights Watch called for implementing any repatriation program with extreme caution while conditions in Afghanistan remain unsafe, and for ending harassment and violence against refugees in Iran and Pakistan. """"While many Afghan refugees want to go home, there are others who are terrified of returning at this time,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"Ethnically motivated attacks, lawlessness, and fighting between rival warlords remain rampant in some areas.""""  The Human Rights Watch report, """"Closed Door Policy: Afghan Refugees in Pakistan and Iran,"""" cautions against a hasty repatriation of Afghan refugees while conditions in Afghanistan remain unstable. Human Rights Watch interviewed many refugees, including members of various ethnic groups, and women and girls, who fear continuing human rights abuses inside Afghanistan.  The decades long Afghan refugee emergency did not end with the fall of the Taliban. There remain three and a half million refugees in Pakistan and Iran, the vast majority of whom arrived before the current armed conflict. Although one hundred forty thousand Afghans went home from Pakistan and Iran in the past six weeks, fifty thousand new refugees fled Afghanistan to Pakistan during the same time period.  Refugees interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Pakistan described the human toll caused by that government's treatment of the refugee population: With borders closed, most refugees had to resort to dangerous and unofficial routes into Pakistan. Refugees were beaten at unofficial checkpoints when they could not afford to pay extortionate bribes. At official crossing points, families were beaten back, or languished in squalor without food, water or latrines-hoping to be let in. Once inside Pakistan, refugees were harassed and imprisoned because they lacked identity documents. They also endured beatings by Pakistani police when queuing for food in camps. """"Many Afghan refugees are in a no-win situation. They have endured violence in Afghanistan, and many fear going home. But they also live with harassment and violence in Pakistan and Iran,"""" said Reilly.  Human Rights Watch called on donor governments to provide adequate funding to the Afghan Interim Authority's Ministry for the Return of Refugees, and for the voluntary return of refugees under conditions of safety and with full respect for their human rights. The January 2002 donor conference in Japan highlighted the need for humanitarian assistance to returning refugees, but the security of returnees cannot be guaranteed under current conditions.  A first step towards ensuring returnees' security would be the expansion of the mandate and presence of the International Security Force beyond Kabul. In addition, the governments of Pakistan and Iran as well as UNHCR must ensure that Afghan refugees have access to full and objective information about conditions inside Afghanistan before deciding whether or not to return. Refugees should not be forced to return prematurely because of insecurity or lack of assistance in neighboring countries.  At the same time, Human Rights Watch urged the governments of Pakistan and Iran to identify those refugees who continue to be in need of protection, to provide them with documentation and a regularized legal status, and to end ongoing abuses of the rights of refugees in both countries.","Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran","Women's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Habré, known as an """"African Pinochet,"""" lives in exile in Senegal, where he was indicted last year on charges of crimes against humanity and torture before courts ruled that he could not be tried there. Investigating Judge Daniel Fransen of the Brussels district court will visit Chad from February 26 to March 7, together with a prosecutor and police inspectors to interview victims and witnesses, look at evidence against the former dictator and visit old massacre and detention sites, said Georges-Henri Beauthier, the lawyer for the Chadian victims who filed the case. Human rights groups hailed the move as a turning point in the years-long effort to bring Habré to justice, as well as an example of the continuing vitality of Belgium's broad anti-atrocity law. """"The wheels of justice are turning,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, who coordinates the victims' quest for justice. """"For the judge and his team to make this long trip shows that Belgium is taking this investigation very seriously. The judge has already taken alot of testimony in Belgium about Habré's atrocities, now he is going to see for himself where and how it all happened."""" """"In the political and legal obstacle course to bringing Habré to book, a new hurdle has been overcome,"""" added Sidiki Kaba, the President of the International Federation of Human Rights. In February 2000, a Senegalese court charged Habré, who ruled the former French colony of Chad in central Africa from 1982 to 1990, with torture and crimes against humanity and placed him under house arrest. But in March 2001 Senegal's highest court said that Habré could not stand trial for crimes allegedly committed elsewhere. Habré's victims immediately announced that they would seek Habré's extradition to Belgium, where a case has been brought by thirteen of Habré's victims, including three Chadians who now reside in Belgium. Belgian law expressly incorporates the principle of """"universal jurisdiction"""" that every state may bring to justice the perpetrators of particular crimes of international concern, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and torture, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims. In a landmark trial last year, four Rwandans were convicted by a Belgian jury on charges of involvement in the 1994 genocide in their country. Although the International Court of Justice in the Hague ruled on February 14 that Belgium could not prosecute sitting high-ranking officials of foreign countries before its courts, that ruling does not apply to Hissène Habré, who is no longer in office and whose immunity is not sought by Chad. The Chadian victims were jubilant at the news of the judge's visit. """"After ten years of effort, having a judge actually come to Chad shows us that something is finally being done,"""" said Suleymane Guengueng, 50, who almost died of dengue fever during two years of mistreatment in Chadian prisons, before helping to found the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP) which represents 792 of Habré's victims. """"I almost can't believe it,"""" said Ismael Hachim, 44, President of the AVCRP, who spent 2 years in Habré's prisons and was subjected to the """"Arbatachar,"""" a frequent form of torture under Habré, in which a prisoner's four limbs were tied together behind his back, leading to loss of circulation and paralysis. """"Since when has justice come all the way to Chad?"""" Senegal is holding Hissène Habré pending his extradition. After Senegal's Court of Final Appeals ruled in March 2001 that Habré could not stand trial there, Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade abruptly announced that he had asked Habré to leave Senegal. The victims filed a petition with the U.N. Committee against Torture, however, which asked Senegal """"not to expel Mr. Hissène Habré and to take all necessary measures to prevent Mr. Hissène Habré from leaving Senegalese territory except pursuant to an extradition demand."""" The request was followed up by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and on September 27, President Wade announced that he would keep Hissène Habré in Senegal pending his extradition to a country such as Belgium where he would receive a fair trial. Habré, now 60, took power in the former French colony of Chad in 1982. The United States and France supported Habré, seeing him as a bulwark against Libya's Moemmar Khadaffi. Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States gave covert CIA paramilitary support to help Habré take power in order, according to Secretary of State Alexander Haig, to """"bloody Khadaffi's nose."""" The United States later provided Habré with tens of millions of dollars per year in military aid and gave training and support to the DDS while it was engaged in torture and other atrocities. The United States also used a clandestine base in Chad to train captured Libyan soldiers whom it was organizing into an anti-Khaddafi force. Habré was deposed in December 1990 and has lived in Senegal since. Last year, the Chadian authorities granted unprecedented access to the files of Habré's dreaded political police - the Documentation and Security Directorate (DDS) -- to the victims and their supporters. The files, submitted to Judge Fransen, detail Habré's campaigns against ethnic groups he perceived as threats to his regime such as the Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989), as well as the large-scale repression of ethnic groups in the south of the country (1984). Dozens of victims and witnesses have also traveled to Brussels to give their testimony. A 1992 truth commission accused Habre's regime of 40,000 political murders and systematic torture, as well and of stealing $11.6 million from the Chadian treasury. With many ranking officials of the current government of Idriss Deby involved in Habré's crimes, however, the new government did not pursue Habre's extradition, and his victims have not sought to bring him back there. The victims' case is also backed by the Chadian Association for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights, the Chadian League for Human Rights, the Association for the Promotion of Fundamental Freedoms in Chad (APLFT), the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO) the National Organization for Human Rights (Senegal) and the French organizations AVRE and Agir Ensemble pour les Droits de l'Homme.","Africa, Chad, Europe/Central Asia, Belgium",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/21/ugandan-parliament-rights-risk","Ugandan Parliament- Rights at Risk","Ugandan Parliament: Rights at Risk","","02/21/2002","(New York) - Human Rights Watch today warned that the recognition of human rights is at risk from three proposed bills under consideration by the Ugandan parliament. The international rights group is particularly concerned with the Non-Governmental Organizations Registration (Amendment) Bill, and had the opportunity to brief members of Ugandan parliament about this planned legislation on non-governmental organizations (NGOs). “We hope that parliament will reject the Non-Governmental Organizations Registration (Amendment) Bill, which could easily be used to obstruct the work of legitimate civil society groups,” said Alison Des Forges, senior advisor at the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  The briefing of the Defense and Internal Affairs Committee was done jointly by Human Rights Watch and a Ugandan human rights association, Foundation for Human Rights Initiative.  The two rights organizations said that the proposed bill would give the government wide-ranging powers to interfere with NGO work and suspend associations. The bill also allows for suspending NGOs that do not conform to any “government policy or plan,” and NGO leaders can be imprisoned for up to one year if they breach the proposed law.  In addition to the Non-Governmental Organizations Registration (Amendment) Bill, two other key bills are pending before the Ugandan parliament – the Suppression of Terrorism Bill and the Political Organizations Bill.  “The parliament is at a historic moment. It can either decide to restrict civil liberties and human rights by passing stringent laws, or it can establish a firm grounding for the respect of human rights,” said Des Forges.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about these two other bills pending before parliament.  “The Political Organizations Bill seeks to solidify the de facto one party system that exists in Uganda. It limits political party activities and violates the rights to freedom of assembly and association”, Alison Des Forges said. “The Suppression of Terrorism Bill has an overly broad definition of terrorism and there is a risk that innocent people or petty criminals be branded as ‘terrorists’.”  The Suppression of Terrorism Bill defines any act of violence or threat of violence for political, religious, economic and cultural ends as a terrorist act. The unlawful possession of arms is also defined as terrorism. Publishing news that is “likely to promote terrorism” can lead to up to ten years imprisonment. The current bill carries a mandatory death sentence for those found to be terrorists; Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.","Africa, Uganda",""

Seven men, including three senior officials, were charged with genocide and crimes against humanity for a massacre in a church in Suai, East Timor on September 6, 1999, in which at least fifty people were killed.  """"Unfortunately, the government's commitment to justice remains in doubt,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The judges were poorly chosen, the prosecutors have shown no interest in accountability, the defense is likely to take advantage of an array of legal loopholes - and the suspects haven't even been detained.""""  Altogether seven men have been charged with genocide and crimes against humanity under Law 26/2000. They are: the former police commander of East Timor Brig. Gen. (then Col.) Timbul Silaen; the former governor of East Timor, Abilio Osorio Soares; Col. Herman Sedyono, the former bupati (head) of Covalima district in which the town of Suai is located; Lt. Col. Lilik Koesherdiyanto, the district military commander; Capt. Ahmad Samsudin, the district military chief of staff; Lt. Sugito, the subdistrict military commander for the town of Suai; and Lt. Col. Gatot Subiakto, the police chief of Suai. There is no indication when trials might begin.  All seven will be tried before an ad hoc human rights court, with specially chosen judges. Law No.26/2000, which authorizes the establishment of ad hoc courts, also authorizes the appointment of non-career judges. Many Indonesians hoped this would permit human rights lawyers or others with real human rights expertise to be appointed. Instead, the Supreme Court used a regulation that only members of university law faculties could be appointed as non-career judges. Twelve obscure academics were appointed as a result, some of whom had associations with senior army officers. Only one of the judges is believed to have any particular expertise in international human rights law, and he is one of those with ties to the military.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern with the prosecutors handling the case. Indonesia's current Attorney-General, M.A. Rahman, who served in the previous government as deputy attorney-general responsible, among other things, for investigating human rights crimes, was obstinately unhelpful with respect to requests for cooperation from U.N. prosecutors in East Timor.  """"Mr. Rahman showed no interest in accountability for crimes in East Timor before he became Attorney-General,"""" said Jones, """"and there is no indication that his attitude has changed.""""  Several legal loopholes are cause for concern. A constitutional amendment passed in August 2000 bans retroactive applications of laws, and while crimes against humanity are considered under international human rights law to be exempt from such restrictions, it is not clear that Indonesian jurists will take that view. The definition of crimes against humanity used in Law 26/2000 was improperly translated from the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, and instead of defining such crimes to include a """"widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population"""", the Indonesian law uses the phrase """"widespread or systematic attack directly on the civilian population."""" That wording may make it more difficult to convict defendants who were not actually present at the scene of the massacre. Finally, the presidential decision setting out the mandate for this ad hoc tribunal authorizes the court to try cases that occurred in April 1999 and after the referendum of August 30, 1999. By restricting its jurisdiction to crimes that occurred in those periods, prosecutors may not be able to get at the broader patterns of state policy and practice that contributed to the violence.  Background The initial investigation on which the indictments were ultimately based was carried out in late 1999 by a special commission of inquiry set up under the then still reputable Indonesian Human Rights Commission. In its report of January 31, 2000, the special commission said that events leading to the Suai massacre began on September 4, the day the results of the U.N.-organized referendum were announced in which almost 80 percent of the population chose independence. On that day, the report notes, there was an attack by the local militia,known as Laksaur, and Indonesian soldiers on a neighborhood in Suai that led hundreds to seek refuge in Our Lady of Fatima church in Suai. On the evening of September 5, the military and militia began burning houses and government buildings in the town. On September 6, they began forcing people from their homes. The subdistrict commander, Lt. Sugito, was specifically named as one of those who took part in the burning and looting of houses.  About 2:30 p.m. on the afternoon of September 6, the report says, members of the Indonesian army and police, as well as men from the Laksaur and Mahidi militias, led by Lt. Sugito and the bupati of Suai, Herman Sediono, directly attacked the church. A priest named Father Hilario was shot in the chest and died; Father Francisco, another priest, was stabbed and hacked to death. An Indonesian priest, Father Dewanto, was also murdered. Of the more than 100 people who had taken refuge in the church, at least fifty are believed to have died. Twenty-six bodies were later put on trucks under the direction of Lt. Sugito and taken across the border to West Timor where they were buried.  In addition to today's indictments, eleven others have been prepared against former regional military commander Maj.Gen. Adam Damiri; Dili-based army commander Brig.Gen. (then Col.) Tono Suratman; his successor, N. Noer Muis; militia leader Eurico Guterres; Endar Prianto; Herman Gultom; Sujarwo; intelligence chief Yayat Sudrajat; Asep Kuwani; Adios Solofo; and militia leader Leonito Martins. They will be charged, among other things, for involvement in another church massacre in Liquisa on April 6, 1999.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice"

Presidency Needs to Address Migrants' Rights  ","02/20/2002","The government of Spain is violating the rights of migrants and asylum seekers who arrive illegally on Spanish shores, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today. In the 35-page report, entitled """"The Other Face of the Canary Islands: Rights Violations Against Migrants and Asylum Seekers,"""" Human Rights Watch criticized the substandard detention conditions and the inadequate procedural rights afforded migrants and asylum seekers upon their arrival to the Spanish islands of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Conditions there fall below standards set in both national and international law and should spur a drive to improve the treatment of migrants in Spain and throughout Europe, Human Rights Watch said. The detention facilities in Fuerteventura and Lanzarote are a makeshift response to the rapid increase in the number of migrants arriving to the Canary Islands in recent years. The number of illegal migrants intercepted upon arrival in the Canaries rose dramatically from 2,241 migrants in 2000 to 4,035 arrivals in 2001. Recent figures suggest that arrivals in 2002 will be even higher, reporting close to 500 arrivals in January alone-almost double the arrivals for January of last year. Migrants come from North Africa, principally Morocco and the Western Sahara, and from sub-Saharan African countries such as Cameroon, Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea Conakry, the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. """"Spain faces a real challenge in the Canary Islands,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But locking people up under such appalling conditions isn't the solution. Immigration controls have to go hand-in-hand with protections for migrants' basic rights."""" Human Rights Watch's investigation, conducted at the end of 2001, involved interviews with over thirty migrants who had been detained in the Canary Island facilities, as well as lawyers, doctors, migrants aid organizations and government representatives familiar with the situation. The Human Rights Watch report describes detention conditions for migrants and asylum seekers held in two extremely overcrowded old airport facilities on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. At times, more than 500 migrants are kept in a space that the Spanish Red Cross has determined to be fit for fifty people. Detainees are cut off from the outside world. There are no telephones. Visits are not permitted. Detainees can never leave the premises; they cannot exercise, and they have no exposure to fresh air or sunlight. The state of medical care and sanitary conditions in the facilities also raises serious concern, particularly since the volunteer doctors at the facilities recently suspended their services there in protest over the conditions. Human Rights Watch found that as a matter of course migrants and asylum seekers arriving illegally to the islands on small boats or rafts are issued orders of deportation and detained in these substandard conditions for up to forty days. Detainees receive virtually no information about their rights, are rarely provided with interpretation or translation-even when asked to sign documents for their deportation-and have inadequate access to meaningful legal representation and individualized judicial oversight of their cases. Asylum seekers experience serious difficulties in their attempts to apply for asylum. The Human Rights Watch report lists a number of steps the Spanish government can take to address the situation, including: Immediately pursuing ways to alleviate the severe overcrowding, particularly in the Fuerteventura facility, and other appalling conditions of detention, including the absence of communication, exercise, and fresh air; Providing all arriving migrants and asylum seekers with information on their rights in Spain-in a language they can understand; Opening the facilities to public visits by nongovernmental organizations, legal service agencies, and humanitarian organizations; Finding alternatives to detention, such as reporting requirements, both for adults and for small children, especially in light of the present situation; Providing necessary training to Spanish lawyers and judicial authorities working with arriving migrants and asylum seekers in the Canary Islands on the Spanish foreigners' and asylum law; Ensuring that migrants wishing to seek asylum have the practical means to do so and are not barred from making such applications; and Clarifying among the responsible government agencies, including the relevant Ministries, the varying procedures by which migrants may be deported from Spain, with a view toward ensuring that the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers is both just and predictable. Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations, Council of Europe, European Union, and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to address its concerns in the Canary Islands and elsewhere in Europe where similar conditions persist. """"Spain is not alone in needing to improve its treatment of migrants and asylum seekers,"""" Andersen said. """"There is clearly a need for heightened attention to the effect of European immigration policy on the rights of migrants and asylum seekers. As a country that is grappling with these challenges at home, we hope that during its current E.U. presidency Spain will put migrants' rights squarely on the Union's immigration policy agenda."""" The report on conditions on the Canary Islands is part of a series of Human Rights Watch investigations into the treatment of migrants in Europe. Human Rights Watch published several commentaries on conditions in Greece last year. Reports on implementation of Spain's new foreigner law and on the treatment of Moroccan children in the North African Spanish cities of Melilla and Ceuta will be published later this year.","Europe/Central Asia, Spain","Children's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

Based on research conducted in the rebel-controlled zone of southern Colombia and elsewhere in the country, Human Rights Watch cautioned that paramilitary forces could inflict brutal reprisals against civilians. """"We're worried that the people who live in the zone -- who were never consulted before the area was ceded to the FARC-EP -- risk abuse by paramilitaries who might identify them as pro-guerrilla simply because they remained in their homes, farms, and businesses,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.  Yesterday, Colombian President Andrés Pastrana announced the end of three years of peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP) and the immediate recovery of control by the Colombian authorities of the Switzerland-sized zone ceded the guerrillas in late 1998. Pastrana's announcement followed the kidnapping of Senator Jorge Gechem Turbay by the FARC-EP on the same day.  Human Rights Watch called upon the Colombian authorities to act immediately to protect civilians from violence perpetrated by the paramilitaries, in view of the long-standing links between some military units and paramilitary forces, and also to respect international humanitarian law in its military efforts to recover control of the rebel haven. Paramilitaries are responsible for the large majority of massacres and extrajudicial executions that take place in the country.  Human Rights Watch also called upon the FARC-EP to release Senator Gechem Turbay immediately and unconditionally, and to stop victimizing civilians.

Human Rights Watch criticized the planned repatriation this week of Montagnards by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) as a rushed procedure that lacks guarantees of safety or ongoing protection for returnees. To date, UNHCR officials have spent only a few days in the Central Highland provinces of Vietnam, from which most of the asylum seekers originate-insufficient time to establish that there has been a fundamental or durable improvement in the human rights situation there.  """"This hasty, ill-conceived operation is not in the best interests of the returnees, and offers no guarantees of protection on return,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"It also undermines UNHCR's own standards on voluntary repatriation-particularly since the plan was flawed to begin with.""""  Human Rights Watch proposed that UNHCR extend the timeframe for repatriation so that the agency has more time to assess conditions in the Central Highlands and counsel refugees about their options. In addition, UNHCR should secure guarantees from the government of Vietnam that UNHCR can establish an ongoing presence in the Central Highlands in order to monitor the refugees' status after return. Quick site visits, which are dependent on the local authorities' goodwill, are not sufficient.  Pressure from the Vietnamese government to return the refugee Montagnard population-referred to by the Vietnamese authorities as 'illegal migrants'-has been intense. A tri-partite agreement among the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments and UNHCR was reached in late January. The agreement includes only two sentences on post-return monitoring and requires that UNHCR obtain permission from Vietnamese authorities before any visits to the Central Highlands.  Human Rights Watch expressed concern at the lack of protection guarantees in the tripartite agreement when it was signed. These concerns appear to have been realized in the proposal to move people back across the border in a rushed operation. The Vietnamese authorities are demanding swift returns, and UNHCR and the Cambodian government seem prepared to comply, even if that means contravening UNHCR's own standards on voluntary repatriation.  """"Without UNHCR monitors stationed in the Central Highlands, there are no guarantees for the safety of returnees or their families,"""" said Jones. """"Protection and safety seem to come a poor second to the wishes of the Vietnamese authorities-who just two weeks ago sentenced to prison terms four Montagnard refugees forced back across the border last year.""""  On January 25, a court in Chu Se District, Gia Lai province, sentenced four Montagnards to prison terms of up to six and a half years for """"organizing illegal migrations."""" The official Vietnamese News Agency reported that Cambodian officials arrested and deported two of the men in April 2001 with a group of thirty-two people; the other two men were deported in mid-May with a group of fifty-one people.  """"The signing of the tripartite agreement does not mean that UNHCR can cut corners on its protection mandate for asylum seekers or rush them into making important decisions such as whether to return home,"""" said Jones. """"Nor should Cambodia ignore its obligations as a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention.""""  More than 1,000 Montagnard asylum seekers, who fled the Central Highlands of Vietnam after unrest in February 2001, are currently sheltered at two sites operated by UNHCR in Cambodia. Human Rights Watch has documented the forcible return of more than 500 Montagnards from Cambodia to Vietnam over the last eleven months.","Asia, Cambodia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Internally Displaced People, Migrants"

The 15-page report, """"Dangerous Dealings: Changes in U.S. Military Assistance After September 11,"""" says Congress and the administration have degraded human rights policy by lifting sanctions on arms transfers to countries with poor human rights records and by cutting required approval times for such transfers.  On January 9, for example, the United States rewarded Tajikistan for its support of the war on terrorism by lifting an eight-year-old ban on arms sales to that Central Asian state. Tajikistan has a history of torture, suppression of political opposition and the media, and arrests based on religion.  """"These transfers won't make the United States more secure in the long run,"""" said Joost R. Hiltermann, Executive Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"And they make the United States complicit in the abuse of civilians in other countries.""""  In recent months, the United States has made almost daily announcements of foreign military aid, including deliveries of defense equipment, proposed arms sales, financial support, and military training. It has had to lift sanctions on several nations to allow such aid to go through. The United States has also dramatically increased military assistance to old allies that have gained new importance since September 11.  While Human Rights Watch does not take a stand on all transfers of military assistance, it opposes assistance to governments that engage in consistent patterns of gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.  Human Rights Watch argues that the United States should carefully monitor its military assistance programs during this time of international conflict and should not loosen controls without regard to human rights consequences.  In October, the United States began delivering weapons and ammunition to anti-Taliban forces in Afghanistan. Although it urged them to respect human rights, the United States made little effort to keep the equipment out of the hands of the worst human rights abusers. Some warlords are now maneuvering to undermine the new Afghan government's efforts to restore the rule of law.  In Central and South Asia, the U.S. government has rewarded political and military support with promises of military assistance. It has failed, however, to condition such aid on improvements in local human rights. Uzbekistan, for example, will receive $43 million in security aid, including $25 million in military assistance and training and $18 million for border security, as a result of its cooperation in the war on terrorism. Uzbekistan has a dismal human rights record, which includes torture and extensive religious persecution.  The effects of the new U.S. policy extend to the rest of the world.  President George Bush in November promised the Philippines $100 million in military aid. The United States has already delivered aircraft and hundreds of small arms and recently began a joint counterterrorism training mission with Philippine troops. In its most recent human rights report, however, the U.S. State Department said abuses by military and police forces include extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary arrest and detention.  In response to its war on terrorism, the United States has also set up mechanisms to """"fast-track"""" military assistance that may help expedite approval of billions of dollars of arms sales to the Middle East, such as a $1.12 billion package of F-16 fighter jets, missiles, and bombs to Oman.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Tajikistan","Arms"

In a detailed background document, Human Rights Watch analyzed China's human rights record over the past year, including: a refurbished """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign that circumvents legal safeguards for criminal suspects, as well as for alleged separatists and so-called religious extremists, tighter restrictions on free expression and the Internet, a continuing crackdown on Falun Gong, other """"cults"""" and religious activities outside the official churches, and violations of key labor rights. """"China may offer another 'dialogue' meeting and the release of a few imprisoned political or religious activists,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"But President Bush should also get commitments from China's top leaders to take some more meaningful steps forward in human rights."""" Human Rights Watch urged President Bush to repeat, in even stronger terms, his comments in Shanghai last October when he criticized China for justifying its abusive treatment of ethnic minorities on anti-terrorist grounds. """"Bush should publicly reject China's claim that its crackdown on peaceful expression of so-called 'separatist' views is part of the war against terrorism,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"He should urge China to open up Xinjiang and Tibet to regular, unrestricted visits by United Nations and independent human rights monitors."""" Human Rights Watch called on Bush to urge President Jiang Zemin and Vice President Hu Jintao to fully implement the recommendations made by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Religious Freedom following a visit to China in November 1994, and to invite the U.N. expert to return to China and Tibet to assess religious freedom. Tens of thousands of Chinese citizens each year are sentenced administratively, without charge or trial, for up to three years of """"reeducation through labor."""" The United Nations has condemned the system as inherently arbitrary. Human Rights Watch urged that in response to an offer of increased U.S. assistance and training in rule of law programs, Bush seek a concrete commitment from China to abolish reeducation through labor. Human Rights Watch also suggested that the White House use the visit to schedule a trip to China later this year by the U.S. Secretary of Labor to offer U.S. assistance with social safety net and worker health and safety programs, as well as to begin a high-level dialogue on China's obligations to respect the basic rights of workers and migrants as a member of the International Labor Organization. Such a visit was suggested by China's labor minister when he came to Washington in March 1999, and with China's entry into the World Trade Organization, increasing unrest among laid off and unemployed workers is widely expected. Former premier Li Peng, now head of the National People's Congress, warned in a letter published by Xinhua, the official news agency, on February 10, that China's leaders are """"firmly opposed to interfering in other countries' internal affairs by using the human rights issue"""" and to """"pursuing hegemony and power politics under the guise of human rights."""" But Li expressed an interest in carrying out """"dialogues and exchanges"""" on human rights. The U.S. and China resumed a formal dialogue in Washington from October 9-11, 2001. The State Department pressed for the release of political and religious dissidents, and raised other issues. Another round of discussions may be announced in conjunction with Bush's trip. """"Without serious pressure, dialogue alone is unlikely to lead to substantial changes in China's human rights practices, or to the release of large numbers of prisoners,"""" Jendrzejczyk said. One way to increase the pressure would be to include members of Congress in Bush's delegation who could reinforce the importance of human rights in U.S.-China relations. In testimony before a newly-created Congressional-Executive Commission on China at its first hearing on February 7, 2002, Human Rights Watch suggested that some members of the Commission, which includes prominent senators and representatives, go with Bush in order to hold bilateral discussions with key ministries on human rights and rule of law concerns.","Asia, China and Tibet, United States","Religious Freedom"

Nobody should be put to death for a crime committed as a teenager,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The fact that Alexander Williams is also mentally ill makes the state's decision to execute him even more reprehensible."""" Outside of the United States, only the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iran are known to have executed juvenile offenders in the last three years. International law prohibits capital punishment for offenses committed below the age of eighteen. Even in the United States, juvenile offenders are rarely put to death. Nationally, a total of eighteen juvenile offenders have been executed since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Of the approximately 20,000 executions carried out in U.S. history, less than 2 percent are known to have been of juvenile offenders. Georgia was the leading state in executions of juvenile offenders until 1957, but it has executed only one other juvenile offender in the past forty-five years. That execution took place in 1993. When juvenile offenders are sentenced to death in Georgia, they are disproportionately black defendants who are convicted of killing white victims. In August, the U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination noted the """"disturbing correlation"""" between race and the imposition of the death penalty in the United States, urging it to ensure that racial bias does not taint the sentencing process. Williams' case also raises concerns because his mental illness and a history of abuse as a child were never presented to the jury. His defense lawyer, who made no effort to investigate these facts, has since been removed from the state courts' list of attorneys who are qualified to handle criminal cases. Williams faced execution in August 2000, but the Georgia Supreme Court granted him a stay while it considered another case that challenged the constitutionality of the state's use of the electric chair. The state now uses lethal injection as its method of execution.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/14/reconstruction-and-human-rights-afghanistan","Reconstruction and Human Rights in Afghanistan","Reconstruction and Human Rights in Afghanistan","Congressional Human Rights Caucus Members' Briefing","02/14/2002","Good Afternoon Chairperson Lantos, Chairperson Wolf, members of the Caucus My name is Widney Brown, I am the advocacy director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. For more than twenty years the people of Afghanistan have suffered severe violations of their human rights. These abuses have been perpetrated by the various governments of Afghanistan, by independent armed forces, and by foreign forces. As a consequence of these violations, the Afghan people now face significant obstacles as they seek to restore peace and security, return and integrate millions of refugees and internally displaced persons, establish the rule of law, rebuild civil society, and promote and protect women's rights. The creation of an interim administration in Kabul, and the physical and institutional reconstruction of the country at large, offer a unique opportunity for instituting human rights protections into Afghanistan's political and societal structures. The Bonn Agreement of December 5, 2001, endorsed by Security Council resolution 1383 of December 6, 2001, acknowledges the centrality of human rights in Afghanistan's future, and calls upon the United Nations to assist Afghanistan in their promotion and protection.  Human Rights Watch recognizes that restoring human rights is central to the successful reconstruction of Afghanistan. However, we also see human rights as an important component to ensuring Afghanistan's future security and stability.  In our view, security and human rights are inexorably linked. Security is a foundation for respect of human rights; but promotion of rights is also a key to building security. For instance, the reporting and prosecution of past abuses can serve to deter future abuses and potentially sideline abusers from positions of power.  There are several areas in the reconstruction effort that now need special attention.  Improving Security International assistance is urgently needed to improve security in Afghanistan and to safeguard what fragile peace and stability already exists.  Chairman Hamid Karzai, in his appearance before the United Nations last month, requested an extension of the current international force (ISAF) beyond Kabul to help the interim authority ensure security during the current political transition. On February 6 of this month, the U.N. Special Representative to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, noted to the Security Council that """"ordinary Afghans, members of the interim authority, and even warlords"""" have called for the expansion of ISAF forces to the rest of the country. Human Rights Watch supports the request of Chairman Karzai and Mr. Brahimi to extend the ISAF force. According to our information, serious abuses of authority are being committed by local commanders in many areas; in addition, armed conflict between rival warlords and their forces is reported in several provinces. There are also troubling reports of civilians targeted for harassment based on their ethnic backgrounds. In some areas, humanitarian agencies have been forced to evacuate their offices during hostilities, and must constantly navigate rivalries between ethnically based forces in delivering assistance.  The lack of security has exacerbated displacement of people to urban areas and neighboring countries, putting many of the displaced at risk of violent attacks, rape and abductions, extortion, discriminatory treatment, and theft. Insecurity has also made it difficult for women in many areas to enjoy the restoration of their rights under the interim administration. In effect, lack of security often means that women are deprived of the ability to participate in the ongoing work of this crucial post-conflict period, thus contributing to their continued marginalization.  Human Rights Watch therefore agrees that an international force is needed immediately to secure other cities and key intermediary roads. We call on the Security Council to expand the mandate of ISAF accordingly. Rebuilding Justice Systems Afghanistan's legal system urgently needs to be rebuilt consistent with international human rights standards. In coming years, major resources are going to be needed for retraining and recruiting new jurists, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, and court personnel. Additional funds will also be needed to rebuild courts, jails, and prisons.  Failure to ensure the rebuilding of an effective justice system will undermine the security within the country. It will be a further obstacle to women's participation in government and other reconstruction programs. In post conflict situations, women often report that the conflict-related violence they experienced is simply replaced by violence at the hands of demobilized combatants - often family members. Failure to address violence against women in the family and community through an effective justice system will ensure that women cannot participate on an equal basis in post conflict reconstruction and government.  In rural areas, the slow process of developing a reliable and fair system of justice will need early attention. Current rural justice mechanisms (i.e., village shuras), whatever else their advantages, are not adequate to address serious criminal offenses; and, as quasi-political entities, they are unfair fora for property disputes, which will be a major issue in coming years. In addition, village systems have traditionally been unable to fairly address crimes against women. We hope that all reconstruction efforts will target rural areas as well as urban - so as to address these problems. The U.N. mission's work as envisioned under the Bonn Agreement includes investigating human rights abuses and recommending remedial measures. In addition, the Bonn Agreement calls for the establishment of an independent domestic human rights commission in the Afghan government, to be assisted by the U.N. Mission. The Commission can help screen and train police and Afghan security forces, as well as monitor human rights abuses and do human rights education in the schools. The U.S. Congress should earmark funds to provide assistance and support for the creation of the Commission. The U.N. Security Council should adopt a resolution that directs the U.N. Mission to support the domestic human rights commission in Afghanistan and pursue U.N.-led human rights initiatives aimed at establishing accountability for serious human rights crimes. Human Rights Watch urges the members of this committee to press the U.S. government to support such a resolution. Accountability for past serious abuses will also have to be addressed. General Assembly Resolution 220 of December 14, 2001 recognizes that """"the accountability of perpetrators of grave human rights violations is a key factor in ensuring reconciliation and stability"""" - a position that was articulated in 2000 by the United Nations Brahimi Report on Peacekeeping and embraced by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.  We also hope that the U.S. government will support efforts at the U.N. Security Council to create a Committee of Experts to be tasked with investigating past abuses, consulting with Afghan leaders, and suggesting appropriate measures to address accountability and justice concerns. We believe that addressing the above issues will be essential for the Afghanistan peace process to succeed. The international community must not allow a situation in which Afghanistan once again slips into lawlessness and anarchy and its people continue to suffer. We are confident that you share this view. Involvement of Women in Reconstruction Efforts Afghan women have been actively engaged with the international donor community, U.N. agencies, and the World Bank, to set their priorities and agendas for the effective participation of women in the reconstruction of Afghanistan. International donors now have the opportunity to implement commitments made regarding the inclusion of Afghan women as decision-makers in the reconstruction effort. As the relief and reconstruction effort is being planned, women have critical information about how to ensure that such relief actually reaches the women of Afghanistan, particularly rural, widowed, illiterate, disabled, internally displaced, and returning refugee women. Women leaders at the local level also have a critical role to play in ensuring women's participation in development programs: their involvement facilitates dissemination of information through networks of women and women's rights NGOs. Towards this end, international agencies and donors -including the United States- should press to ensure that Afghan women are appointed to senior positions in the government.  Women's rights must be prioritized in Afghanistan's reconstruction effort. Under the interim government arrangements a Judicial Commission is tasked with rebuilding the domestic justice system that will operate fully in accordance with international human rights standards. In light of the historical pattern of systematic discrimination against and persecution of women in Afghanistan, it is vital that efforts be made to pressure Afghanistan's new government to establish laws guaranteeing women's rights to education, political involvement, free expression, mobility, employment, and health care. U.N. human rights gender advisors will be a vital force in pushing for these protections; but again, advisory teams on human rights will require funding. Congress should earmark Afghanistan reconstruction funds specifically for this purpose. Refugees Independent human rights monitoring on conditions inside Afghanistan (as mentioned earlier) is critical also to the repatriation and return process for Afghan refugees and internally displaced persons. Refugees and returnees can only make a voluntary decision about return to Afghanistan if they have access to reliable, impartial, and accessible information concerning conditions in their home areas. Funding and support for in-country human rights monitoring is therefore a priority from the standpoint of protecting refugees. In host countries, like Pakistan and Iran, screening mechanisms will need to be put in place for those refugees who are unable or unwilling to return to their own countries. Screening must be fair and impartial and according to recognized international standards. Funding for such programs - implemented with coordination by UNHCR - is essential if these standards are to be met.  Children and Education Human Rights Watch believes that education is one of the most important foundations for Afghanistan's future. The United States, in providing assistance to Afghanistan, should put special emphasis on establishing or reestablishing schools throughout Afghanistan so that every child has access to education. Well-funded schools, which also provide meals and clothing, can help to counteract the factors which cause parents to place children in other inadequate institutions, or keep them at home.  Human Rights Watch agrees with many of the objectives of the Afghanistan Freedom and Reconstruction Act of 2001 and hope that in fiscal year 2003 Congress will greatly increase the funding for reconstruction. However, we are concerned that the lack of coordination among donors means that funding is happening on an ad hoc basis - of great concern, for instance, is the fact that to date, the Women's Ministry has yet to be funded despite numerous calls of support for restoring women's rights in Afghanistan. Congress should designate funding for the Women's Ministry in next year's budget and urge the administration and the UN to immediately release funds currently available to the ministry. It is time for the U.S. government, other donor governments and the UN and its related agencies to move from rhetoric to concrete actions - doing so in a transparent manner that allows Afghans themselves to evaluate whether progress is being made, critical life supporting needs are being met and whether human rights are being restored. Congress can play an important role in this process, sustaining the interest and commitment of the American people to help the Afghan people in the rebuilding of their own country.

In an unusually abrupt proceeding attended by Chomsky on February 13, the Istanbul State Security Court acquitted Tas of charges of publishing """"separatist propaganda,"""" prohibited under Article 8 of Turkey's Anti-Terror Law. The text at issue was a summary of the human rights situation in southeastern Turkey, written by Chomsky. The case had embarrassed the Turkish government, which has committed itself to improving freedom of expression in Turkey as part of its bid to join the European Union. Tas was acquitted on the first day of the trial, after the prosecutor who had brought the charges unexpectedly requested an acquittal.  """"It is an extraordinary outcome. Normally a case like this would drag on for a year and a half and end with a prison sentence,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Human Rights Watch's Turkey researcher, in Istanbul to observe the Tas trial. """"We only hope that it is more than a one-time response to Chomsky's celebrity status and signals a new approach by Turkey's justice system to respect the right to free expression in all cases.""""  Human Rights Watch said that the significance of the decision would become clear in the coming weeks, as courts reach judgments in similar pending cases. Nese Duzel, a journalist whose case also came before the Istanbul State Security Court Wednesday, faces charges of """"incitement to racial hatred"""" for publishing an interview describing the situation of the Alevi minority in Turkey.  In contrast to the Chomsky case, proceedings in the Duzel case were postponed, pending the entry into force of amendments to the article of the criminal code under which Duzel was charged. The amendments were part of what the government called a """"mini-democracy package,"""" aimed at addressing restrictions on free expression that violated international standards. Human Rights Watch discounted the impact of the recent reform, which has left in place many legal prohibitions that could be used to restrict protected expression.  """"Years of monitoring human rights in Turkey have shown us that when one law is improved, another is pressed into service to restrict peaceful expression,"""" Sugden explained. """"What would truly be meaningful would be for the Turkish justice system to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights and throw out abusive cases like they did in the Tas case.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

The group stressed, however, that the ruling left intact the Belgian law’s sweeping “universal jurisdiction” provisions which allow Belgian courts to prosecute atrocities committed abroad.  The ICJ ruled that the Belgian warrant failed to respect the Foreign Minister's """"immunity from criminal jurisdiction."""" The Court noted, however, that even sitting government ministers may not """"enjoy impunity in respect of any crimes they might have committed"""" and could be prosecuted in an international court or once they left office. """"This decision effectively shields some state officials from prosecution for atrocities,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Government ministers who commit serious crimes are not likely to be prosecuted at home, and this ruling means they will enjoy impunity abroad as well, at least while they are in office. This decision goes against the international trend towards accountability for the worst abuses, but it should not stop Belgium from pursuing cases against perpetrators no longer covered by immunity."""" The group said that the case of Hissène Habré illustrates the importance that the Belgian law can play in assuring that perpetrators of the worst international crimes are brought to justice. In February 2000, a court in Senegal, where Habré lives in exile, indicted the former Chadian dictator on charges of torture and crimes humanity, and placed him under house arrest. It was the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. In March 2001, however, Senegal's Supreme Court ruled that he could not be tried in Senegal for crimes allegedly committed in Chad because Senegal had not adopted the necessary procedural laws. However a group of Habré' s victims, including several Belgian citizens, are now seeking Habré's extradition to stand trial in Belgium, and the President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, has recently agreed, after a plea by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, to hold Habré in Senegal pending an extradition request from Belgium. That case is now before Investigating Judge Daniel Fransen of the Brussels district court, who will soon visit Chad to investigate Hissène Habré´s crimes. Brody added that today's decison """"highlights the need for the rapid establishment of the International Criminal Court, which will be able to investigate and prosecute those individuals -- including state leaders -- accused of crimes against humanity, genocide, and war crimes when national courts are unwilling or unable to do so, and which expressly rejects any substantive or jurisdictional immunities.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Belgium","International Justice"

The United Nations Security Council will be discussing the Secretary General’s report on the deteriorating security environment in the D.R. Congo in the coming week. Human Rights Watch urges the Security Council to address the government of Uganda as an important agent of unrest in the eastern part in the country, and to hold it liable for the grave rights violations and massive human suffering taking place in territories under its occupation.  The United Nations peacekeeping force in Congo (MONUC) should also exert maximum pressure on local contenders to cease fighting and should send additional military, humanitarian, and human rights monitors to the area.  Uganda has occupied the area militarily since 1998 and has supported all three rival groups with arms, training, and political backing. Under the terms of the 1999 Lusaka Peace Accords, Uganda has withdrawn some troops from the Congo but maintained or redeployed others in the area.  “Uganda wants to keep enough control to continue getting rich from the Congo, but doesn’t want to take responsibility for protecting civilians,” said Alison Des Forges, senior advisor for the Great Lakes region at Human Rights Watch. Ituri district is rich in timber, gold and diamonds, among other resources.  On February 4, four suspected supporters of the Lendu were killed in Bunia, capital of Ituri district, in the latest of a series of ethnic clashes that cost more than a hundred lives and displaced at least fifteen thousand persons in recent weeks.  With ethnic clashes increasing, Uganda pulled troops back to Bunia from elsewhere in Ituri instead of using them to contain the violence. Ugandan authorities were prepared to defend the town and to prevent the conflict from spilling over into Uganda itself. According to local sources, the Ugandan army in mid January deployed hundreds of soldiers in the border towns of Aru, Mahagi, and at Ariwara.  On February 1, Ugandan Defense Minister Amama Mbabazi remarked that the situation in Bunia was explosive and called on the UN to send troops to take control of the area.  “Uganda can’t foist responsibility on the UN for restoring order from the chaos it has fostered,” said Des Forges. “As the occupying power, under international law it must protect civilians and stop these killings.”","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda","United Nations"

On February 7, the Turkish Grand National Assembly passed new laws ostensibly easing Turkey's longstanding restrictions on free speech, but Human Rights Watch said the legislation made only minor and insufficient changes.  """"Turkey is in the middle of a free speech crisis, and the new laws will not relieve the situation,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Human Rights Watch's researcher for Turkey.  In the latest of a series of high-profile free expression cases, the American academic Noam Chomsky will appear at Istanbul State Security Court today for the trial of his publisher Fatih Tas, who has been indicted for publishing a translation of Chomsky's work allegedly containing """"separatist propaganda"""" prohibited under Article 8 of Turkey's anti-terror law. Chomsky's writings summarized the history of human rights violations in southeast Turkey.  """"By leaving most of these laws on the books, parliament has effectively passed the buck to the courts,"""" said Sugden, who is in Istanbul to observe the Tas case. """"If prosecutors continue to insist on using these laws to charge people with crimes for their peaceful expression, it's going to be up to judges to follow their own constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights and toss those actions out."""" The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly held that the Turkish government's prosecutions of non-violent speech under its restrictive laws have violated the European Convention, which under Turkey's constitution takes precedence over Turkish domestic law.  The case involving Chomsky's publisher is an embarrassment to Turkey, which is trying to improve its rights record in its bid to join the European Union. The E.U. has said that it expects freedom of expression problems to be cleared up in the """"short term"""" - normally understood in the E.U. accession context to mean one year. The new laws appear to be an effort to meet this deadline as March 2002 marks one year since Turkey adopted its national program for E.U. accession.  In addition to the case involving Chomsky's publisher, 68 students have been arrested in the past three months for writing to the university authorities and asking them to put the Kurdish language on the curriculum. It is expected that the students will be charged under the anti-terror law, because the authorities claim that the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which fought the Turkish security forces in the southeast until 1999, is behind the student movement. Human Rights Watch has reports that many of the students have been tortured in custody. On February 5, 2002, thirteen women sat in the dock in an Istanbul criminal court for """"insulting the security forces,"""" because they held a meeting to protest sexual assault. Human Rights Watch said that none of these cases is affected by the new laws, except that the possible sentences have been reduced.  """"Turkey has been tinkering with its laws restricting the freedom of expression for a decade, without any significant progress to show for it,"""" said Sugden. """"Successive governments have contented themselves with insignificant alterations to manifestly rotten laws in order to offset criticism and appear to be doing something.""""  The most recent amendments to Turkey's speech laws altered Articles 312 and 159 of the Turkish Criminal Code (TCC). Article 312 provides for prison sentences of up to two years for incitement to religious or racial hatred.  The """"mini-democracy package"""" passed on February 7 changed the wording of Article 312 so that such incitement could only be punished if it presented """"a possible threat to public order."""" Whether this amendment brings the law in line with international human rights standards will depend on how courts interpret it. In the past, Turkish courts have deemed calls for """"brotherhood"""" between Turks and Kurds as incitement to racial hatred, and suggestions that earthquakes are divine punishment as incitement to religious hatred. The new law also reduced the prison sentences for Article 159 of the TCC from a maximum of six years to three years, but left the description of the offense unchanged.  Chomsky's writings have been indicted under Article 8 of the Anti-Terror Law, which last week's reform left untouched, along with the Law to Protect Ataturk, under which the former parliamentary deputy Hasan Mezarci was imprisoned for a year on February 5, 2002.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye","Free Speech"

Human Rights Watch urged the Cambodian government to take the necessary measures to bring the proposed tribunal up to international standards so that the U.N. could participate.  """"Given the failure of the Cambodian government to address the concerns about the tribunal raised more than a year ago, we feel the U.N. acted appropriately,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Cambodian people deserve justice, but at the same high standard as the people of the former Yugoslavia.""""  The U.N. legal office announced last week that it was withdrawing from further discussions with the Cambodian government over the establishment of a special """"mixed tribunal"""" composed of both Cambodian and foreign judges and prosecutors. A law setting up that tribunal, passed by the Cambodian National Assembly in January 2001 and signed by King Sihanouk in August 2001, had serious shortcomings from a human rights perspective.  One of the most glaring defects of the law is that it could prevent prosecution of senior Khmer Rouge leaders who previously received pardons or amnesties. The Royal Cambodian Government's pardon of former Khmer Rouge Foreign Minister Ieng Sary after he defected in 1996, for example, might be allowed to stand. The U.N. had insisted on a provision that previous pardons or amnesties would not be a bar to prosecutions.  The law also deletes all references to defendants' right to counsel of their choice, thus undermining the possibility that defendants will have proper defense and be allowed access to international counsel. Supporters of the Cambodian legislation argue that this kind of detail can be worked out later. Human Rights Watch believes that the U.N. should not cooperate with a domestic tribunal that does not meet international standards because this will not address Cambodia's need for real accountability for the Khmer Rouge's crimes. Human Rights Watch urged donor governments to strongly encourage the Cambodian government to promptly demonstrate its willingness to fully meet the criteria laid out by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. In the meantime, donors should not pledge any assistance for a domestic Cambodian tribunal that is not fully independent and impartial.  The Cambodian government has said that it is willing to go it alone, without the U.N. But Japan, the European Union, the United States and other donors have repeatedly said they would only support a tribunal with U.N. involvement.

Humane treatment of those detainees is not only required by the Geneva Conventions, but it will contribute to the credibility of future American efforts to insist on appropriate treatment of detainees by other governments in this or any other armed conflict. The broader national and international interests in upholding international legal obligations will only be served, however, if the detention conditions are fully transparent.  We therefore renew our request to visit the the camp at Guantanamo Bay and in addition request access to facilities at Kandahar, Bagram and other locations in Afghanistan where captured combatants are being held by U.S. armed forces. We would like to tour the camps, speak with U.S. officials about current conditions and future plans, and interview detainees in private. Although the Pentagon has provided information about the conditions under which Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees are being held in Guantanamo Bay and has permitted some press access, the conditions of confinement of captured combatants held overseas-which are no less important-remain essentially unknown.  You have publicly committed """"to bring more transparency as to how [the United States] handles detainees"""" in the Afghanistan conflict, and """"to fashion a system that is as open as possible so that the American people can have a good comfort level about the process itself."""" An independent assessment and public accounting of the detention conditions would further these aims. While the ICRC has visited detainees held by the U.S. in Cuba as well as in Afghanistan, their findings are confidential.  Monitoring conditions under which detainees are held is central to Human Rights Watch's mission and experience. For over two decades, we have promoted adherence to the laws of war by parties to armed conflict as well as respect for international human rights norms. We have monitored the conduct of parties to many conflicts, bringing to bear our investigative expertise, our impartiality and our commitment to meticulous respect for the facts. We also have over two decades of experience assessing conditions of detention in facilities around the world.  We would hope to be able to review our findings with the Defense Department prior to releasing them publicly and would welcome the opportunity to talk with department officials about any problems we identified and possible solutions to them. In visiting the facilities, we would also abide by the security conditions that the Department imposes.  We would like to undertake the visits to the U.S. facilities as soon as possible.

The 147-page report examines two sectors, export processing and private households, which employ tens of thousands of women sewing clothes for sale in the United States and working as live-in domestic workers.  The report, From the Household to the Factory: Sex Discrimination in the Guatemalan Labor Force, also finds that some U.S.-based clothing retailers contract with Guatemalan """"maquilas,"""" or export-processing factories, that discriminate against women who are pregnant.  The Guatemalan labor code protects women workers from this type of discrimination, but is rarely enforced in the maquila sector. Meanwhile, women and girls working in private households do not have adequate legal protection, and are frequently subject to sexual assault and other abuses by their employers.  """"Women workers are getting a very raw deal in Guatemala,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The country's labor law has some major gaps, and in many cases it's not being enforced anyway. The Guatemalan government has got to do a better job protecting women workers.""""  Domestic workers, many of whom come from Guatemala's historically oppressed indigenous communities, do not have the legal right to be paid the minimum wage. They also have no right to an eight-hour work day or a forty-eight hour work week, have only limited rights to national holidays and weekly rest, and by and large are denied the right to employee-paid health care under the national social security system.  Many domestic workers begin working as young adolescents. Guatemalan labor laws do not provide adequate protection for domestic workers who are under the age of eighteen. International law requires Guatemala to protect children from the most serious forms of child labor, including work for long hours and employment that puts them at risk of sexual abuse.  With the expansion of the export-processing sector in Guatemala, thousands of women who might otherwise become domestic workers are now seeking jobs in the """"maquilas,"""" apparel manufacturing factories. An estimated 80 percent of the 80,000 maquila workers in Guatemala are women.  In order to get a job in a factory, women must often reveal whether they are pregnant, either through questions on job applications, in interviews, or through physical examinations. Workers who become pregnant after being hired are often denied the full range of maternity benefits provided for in Guatemalan law. And the maquilas routinely obstruct workers' access to the employee health care system to which they have a right - with a direct impact on working women's reproductive health.  """"The maquilas offer much-needed jobs to thousands of women,"""" said Jefferson. """"But the price of a job should never be working women's rights to equality.""""  The U.S.-based clothing manufacturers and retailers that have contracts with discriminatory maquilas include Target, The Limited, Wal-Mart, GEAR for Sports, Liz Claiborne and Lee Jeans. All of these have codes of conduct or terms of engagement that prohibit discrimination. GEAR for Sports and Lee Jeans specifically prohibit pregnancy testing.  In an era of increased globalization, corporations have a critical role to play in promoting and protecting universally recognized human rights generally, and labor rights in particular, Human Rights Watch said.

Homsi's trial was adjourned last week until February 13, and Seif's was postponed until February 14. In a letter sent last week to President Asad Human Rights Watch condemned a new press law passed in September 2001 and urged the president to remove or amend provisions not in compliance with the internationally recognized right to freedom of expression.  """"Syria had begun to move in the direction of opening up political space and permitting serious debate about the country's future,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.

The government's decision to replace the 1949 General Law on Printed Matter represented an opportunity to bring domestic legislation in line with the free expression standards embodied in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Syria is a state party. But the press decree, which regulates newspapers and other publications, is """"a real disappointment,"""" Megally said.  The decree enables privately owned newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals to seek licenses to publish, but also permits the prime minister arbitrarily to deny licenses for reasons """"related to the public interest.""""

But it will also be seen as a prelude to the permanent International Criminal Court, the most important new human rights institution in more than half a century. His trial begins Tuesday, February 12, in the Hague.    The International Criminal Court is only a few months away. Sixty states must ratify the treaty for the court to be established; as the Milosevic trial begins in The Hague, fifty-two states have ratified. The court's jurisdiction will commence sixty to ninety days after the sixtieth ratification.     So the International Criminal Court should get underway this summer. The first assembly of states who are members of the court is scheduled to take place in New York, at United Nations headquarters, in the first week of September.     The International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction over future cases of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. It will not be able to pursue any crimes that have been committed in the past. Nor will the court be able to pursue cases that are already being dealt with, in credible fashion, by national courts.     For the court to be able to take on a case, either the crime must have been committed in a country that has ratified the treaty, or the crime must have been committed by a national of a country that has ratified the treaty. The United Nations Security Council can also refer a matter to the court.     The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, where Milosevic is being prosecuted, represents real progress for the victims of grave human rights abuse. But it is still an ad hoc tribunal. The process of setting up individual courts is too slow and cumbersome for justice to be done in all the places that the world needs it.     Human Rights Watch, along with many other organizations, has been working for more than seven years to further the establishment of an international criminal court and welcomes the court's enormous potential for safeguarding human rights.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

""""The INS has finally allowed Human Rights Watch and other human rights groups into these jails to see conditions under which September 11 detainees are held,"""" said Allyson Collins, Associate Director of the U.S. program, who visited the jails. """"This is a welcome first step towards more openness about the treatment of these detainees.

Human Rights Watch visited two jails, which reportedly hold a large percentage of the nation's September 11 detainees: the Hudson County Correctional Center in Kearny and the Passaic County Jail in Paterson. During the visits, the INS refused to provide the number of INS detainees held at the facilities.  At Hudson County jail, INS and jail officials gave a thorough tour of the modern facility, including an occupied housing unit. The tour of Passaic County Jail, however, was rushed and incomplete. In contrast to the Hudson County visit, few questions were answered. During a tour of the jail, officials refused a Human Rights Watch request to view an occupied housing unit, citing privacy and security concerns - although they had permitted the group to view an occupied housing unit at Hudson County jail. Detainees held at the Passaic County Jail have told Human Rights Watch that housing cells are cramped and that the detainees are confined with accused and convicted criminals.  Human Rights Watch was able to interview detainees at both jails after the tours.  Beginning in October, Human Rights Watch made a series of requests to the INS to visit facilities holding September 11 detainees. The INS originally refused access to Hudson County and Passaic County jails, but reversed its decision last week. Human Rights Watch's requests to visit the Metropolitan Correctional Center and Metropolitan Detention Center, both in New York City, were denied; requests at several other jails and immigration detention centers around the United States are now pending.

Falungong members have been classified with Tibetan and Uighur 'splittists' and unauthorized religious groups as a major threat to the Communist Party, Human Rights Watch said. The 117-page report, Dangerous Meditation: China's Campaign Against Falungong, analyzes why and how the Chinese government embarked on a plan to eradicate the group it terms an """"evil cult.""""  In recent documents, the Chinese government has suggested that Falungong is a terrorist organization.  """"China's efforts to equate the Falungong with terrorists are ludicrous,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Most Falungong members are peaceful, law-abiding citizens, and there is no excuse for the human rights violations they have endured."""" The new report traces the evolution of the Chinese government's crackdown, starting with the July 1999 ban on the hierarchically-organized meditation group, which now boasts millions of members worldwide. From the initial ban, the government moved on to prohibit practicing the group's exercises in public, and to confiscate and destroy hundreds of thousands of copies of its publications.  The Chinese government has used increasingly violent tactics as Falungong followers have mounted peaceful demonstrations against the crackdown. It has also used administrative detention procedures to hold followers in reeducation camps and psychiatric facilities. The Chinese judiciary has reinterpreted existing law to facilitate arrests of Falungong supporters.  Dangerous Meditation also documents Chinese success in limiting the growth of Falungong in other countries through warnings that tolerance of the organization could jeopardize bilateral relations. The Hong Kong government has responded uneasily to Falungong's presence there.  """"The charge that Falungong threatens the stability of China does not hold up,"""" said Jones. """"Its claim that belief in Falungong is a public health menace is equally bogus. The danger to health comes from the treatment its practitioners receive at the hands of the police and prison officials.""""  Dangerous Meditation features one follower's lengthy account of his treatment in detention, his renouncement of Falungong under pressure, and his recantation of his testimony once he was freed. He describes the first of his four detentions. Police officers took him to the local police station where he was knocked down, kicked so severely that the his leg took three months to heal, and shocked with electric batons until he """"lost his mind."""" The police chief told him, """"If you die, we will bury you and tell everyone you committed suicide because you were afraid of a criminal charge.""""  Human Rights Watch notes that the """"anti-cult"""" legislation developed to eliminate Falungong is being used against at least sixteen other religious organizations that refuse to tailor their beliefs and practice to the demands of the Chinese government. In recent months members of such groups, including Mentuhui, Nanfang Jiaohui, and the Holy Spirit Reconstruction Church, have been sentenced to long prison terms. Only international pressure has saved some from immediate execution.  Human Rights Watch called on the Chinese government to amend laws referring to """"superstitious sects,"""" """"secret societies,"""" and """"evil religious organizations"""" - the definition of which is largely political - and to revise regulations that censor the media and the Internet. Falungong's capacity to mobilize its supporters inside and outside China has stemmed from a highly sophisticated use of electronic communication.  Human Rights Watch also urged multinational corporations to avoid complicity in human rights abuses by preventing the dismissal of workers whom local cadres have accused of Falungong membership. It also urged the international community to speak out against China's human rights record, including its treatment of Falungong practitioners, through a resolution at the meeting of the U.N.

Milosevic is the first former head of state to be charged with genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.   """"This trial is a great step forward for justice, but equally notable are those indicted war criminals missing from the dock,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program. """"Too many of the most senior Serb indictees remain at large. The blame lies with Balkan governments that have failed to cooperate with the tribunal, and with NATO, which has for six years operated in Bosnia without rounding up Milosevic's co-conspirators.""""     Milosevic will be tried on three indictments for charges arising from the wars in Kosovo, Croatia, and Bosnia. The trial is expected to be enormously complex and lengthy. The charges cover ten years and include multiple counts of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Several hundred witnesses will testify. Milosevic, who has chosen to represent himself, continues to deny the authority of the tribunal to try him.     """"A major challenge for the judges is to apply the statute and rules so that Slobodan Milosevic gets a fair trial,"""" Dicker said. """"To date we are satisfied that the tribunal has respected his rights. Even though it would be easier for the judges and the prosecutor if Milosevic was defended by a lawyer, the tribunal is respecting his right to choose to defend himself without the assistance of counsel.""""     While agreeing that Milosevic can represent himself, the three-judge trial panel has appointed three """"amici curiae,"""" or friends of the court -- lawyers who are tasked with helping the court ensure that Milosevic gets a fair hearing.    Indictees at Large     Human Rights Watch said Milosevic's prosecution highlights the continued impunity enjoyed by several indicted Serb leaders. As the trial begins, the four other accused named in the Kosovo indictment remain free, Dragoljub Ojdanic, former Chief of the Yugoslav Army's General Staff, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, former Serbian Minister of the Interior, Nikola Sainovic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, and Milan Milutinovic, who still holds the post of President of the Republic of Serbia.     Also at liberty are Milosevic's alleged co-conspirators under the Bosnia indictment, Radovan Karadzic, wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb military commander. Karadzic is reportedly hiding in the Bosnian Serb entity of Bosnia-Herzegovina; Mladic is believed to be in Serbia. In 1995, the two were indicted for their roles in the Bosnian war.     Although Human Rights Watch welcomed the start of the Milosevic trial, the group cautioned that much remained to be done to obtain the justice so needed to move the region past the recent history of ethnic tension and violence. Human Rights Watch said that the tribunal's unfinished business includes indictments of Kosovo Albanians for crimes committed against ethnic Serbs in Kosovo.     The ICTY was created in 1993 by U.N. Security Council resolution 827, which obliged all U.N. member states to """"cooperate fully"""" with the tribunal and """"take any measures necessary under their domestic law"""" to comply with its demands. The U.N. Charter's article 25, in turn, obliges member states to implement Security Council decisions.     Serbia, one of the constituent republics of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, has cooperated with the tribunal, handing over Milosevic and several other indictees. Until now, the federal government of Yugoslavia, led by President Vojislav Kostunica, has rebuffed requests for cooperation from the tribunal. Kostunica continues to denounce the tribunal and discredit its proceedings in the view of Yugoslav public opinion.    Trial Background     On May 24, 1999, the tribunal indicted Milosevic, along with four other senior officials and officers, for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Yugoslav and Serbian troops under their command in Kosovo in early 1999. The crimes include the slaughter of hundreds of ethnic Albanians, forcible deportations of hundreds of thousands of people, and persecution based on racial, religious, and political identification.     The tribunal indicted Milosevic a second time on October 29, 2001, for crimes he allegedly committed in Croatia. The indictment charges Milosevic with multiple counts of murder, torture, detention, deportation and other atrocities committed during the attempted ethnic cleansing of Croatia from 1991 to 1992.     On December 11, 2001, the ICTY issued a third indictment against Milosevic for crimes in Bosnia. The indictment includes one count of genocide, one count of complicity with genocide, and an additional twenty-seven counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity arising from the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995. The new charges cover the shelling of Sarajevo; the mass murder of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, both U.N.-proclaimed """"safe areas;"""" and for the Omarska detention camp.

Bush correctly acknowledged that the Geneva Conventions apply to the conflict in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said today. But he erred in deciding that the Conventions do not cover al-Qaeda detainees and by categorically ruling out prisoner of war status for Taliban detainees without convening a competent tribunal, as the Geneva Conventions require. The Geneva Conventions should apply to both Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees being held by U.S. forces at Guantanamo and in Afghanistan, even if ultimately the al-Qaeda fighters would likely not be accorded POW status, Human Rights Watch said. The Conventions provide explicit protections to all combatants captured in an international armed conflict, even if they are deemed to be unprivileged combatants not entitled to POW status. """"The Administration is right to acknowledge that it has to play by the rules, but it can't then rewrite the rules to suit its purposes,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"What makes this decision hard to understand is that the Geneva Conventions don't prevent the United States from interrogating or prosecuting detainees."""" Unlike the al-Qaeda fighters, detainees who fought for the Taliban probably should be accorded POW status because they fought for the armed forces of a party to the Convention, whether or not their government was recognized and whether or not their fighters respected the laws of war.

The Nigerian government’s role in both carrying out, and failing to prevent, massive violence should be addressed along with human rights violations committed by non-state actors.

We urge you to use your trip to West Africa to describe the importance that your government attaches to respect for human rights in Africa and how it intends to integrate these concerns into its policy in this region. Well-timed public statements on the observation of international law, justice for egregious violations of that law, and respect for fundamental civil and political rights would make clear your government's commitment to these issues.   The following are some of our main concerns and recommendations in two of the countries you will be visiting - Nigeria and Sierra Leone.   Nigeria   Halfway through the four-year term of Olusegun Obasanjo's presidency, the overall human rights picture in Nigeria remains poor. Despite investigations into past abuses, there have been alarming developments, in particular recurring violence between ethnic or religious groups in several parts of the country. Nigerians are expressing disillusion with the lack of fundamental change since the advent of a civilian government in 1999. The legacy of decades of repressive military rule is still keenly felt. The military as well as the police continue to violate human rights with almost complete impunity, and the government has done very little to enforce accountability. Given the close ties between your government and that of President Obasanjo, and the fact that Obasanjo himself is a key player in the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) launched last year, it is particularly important that you raise publicly and privately these human rights concerns.   Massacres by the military: Between 22 and 24 October 2001, Nigerian soldiers killed more than 200 unarmed civilians in Gbeji, Zaki-Biam and several other towns and villages in Benue State, in a well-organized reprisal operation following the abduction and killing of nineteen soldiers by an armed group. The soldiers also destroyed hundreds of houses and other buildings in the area. The Nigerian government has failed to take any action against the soldiers or their commanders responsible for the killings in Benue, or even to issue a strong condemnation. On the contrary, President Obasanjo appeared to defend these actions. After forcefully denouncing the killing of the nineteen soldiers and urging that no effort be spared to track down the perpetrators, initially he barely responded to the news that the military had in turn killed unarmed civilians.   The events in Benue are reminiscent of a similar military reprisal operation which took place in November 1999 in Odi, Bayelsa state, in the south of Nigeria: following the murder of twelve policemen, soldiers went on the rampage and killed hundreds of civilians, perhaps as many as 2,000. More than two years on, no one has been prosecuted for these actions either.   Inter-communal violence: There has been an increase in inter-communal violence across Nigeria, particularly in the central / """"middle belt"""" states (Nasarawa, Plateau, Taraba) and the north (Kano, Kaduna). Several thousand people have been killed in fighting between different ethnic groups in these and other states. There have also been repeated clashes in the southwest and in the Delta. Inter-communal violence is likely to be the most serious concern in Nigeria for the foreseeable future. There are a number of longstanding conflicts that could explode again at any time. One of the most serious in the last few months was the crisis in Jos in September 2001, which claimed more than 1,000 lives; another is the ongoing conflict between the Jukuns and the Tivs, and related tensions between other groups, in the central states of Benue, Taraba and Nasarawa.   In late 2001, the government finally embarked on a number of initiatives (meetings, special commissions) to study the problem, but it remains to be seen whether these will be effective remedies, or just another token exercise. To date the government has preferred to shy away from implementing concrete measures to prevent further violence.   Pre-election violence: With elections scheduled for 2003, this year will be a critical one for Nigeria. One of the main concerns for this period is the likelihood of pre-election violence. The prospect of elections has already created a sharp increase in political tension and in-fighting, as well as actual violence in different parts of the country. It is still unclear to what extent the murder of Minister of Justice Bola Ige in December 2001 was directly related to the elections, but his death can only further unsettle the political scene. President Obasanjo's endorsement of the electoral bill, which effectively prevents any new political parties from registering, has also provoked much anger and controversy.   Vigilante violence: Vigilante violence, and political use of vigilante groups, are likely to increase in the run-up to elections. A Human Rights Watch research mission in October 2001 uncovered serious human rights abuses by the vigilante group known as the Bakassi Boys, active in Anambra, Abia and Imo states, in the southeast. The Bakassi Boys have been responsible for public and very brutal executions, systematic torture and unlawful arrests and detentions, often with the active support of state government authorities. Likewise in the southwest, the O'odua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba ethnic militia group which has partly turned into a vigilante group, has been responsible for repeated outbreaks of violence. Some politicians have used these groups as thugs to support their re-election campaigns.   It is essential that Nigerian government authorities take measures to prevent further excesses by all these groups without delay, as in some cases, they are already escaping the control of government and security agencies. The emergence of these groups is clearly linked to the dramatic inadequacy of the national law enforcement agencies, especially the police. Long-awaited reforms of the police force should be a priority of the government. Measures should also be taken to discipline, and where appropriate, prosecute politicians who use vigilante groups for their personal or political ends.   Sierra Leone   Human Rights Watch praises the considerable commitment your government has shown towards maintaining stability in Sierra Leone. In particular we commend your willingness to make a long-term commitment to rebuild and reform the Sierra Leone Army, the Sierra Leone Police and the judicial system. While the human rights situation in Sierra Leone has dramatically improved, the rule of law remains dreadfully weak, and the poverty and corruption which gave rise to the decade-long conflict remains much the same. If there is insufficient reform within these key institutions and if the root causes of the war are not properly addressed, the precarious peace afforded by the disarmament of over 45,000 combatants will be in jeopardy. It is therefore essential for those involved in the training of soldiers and police, whose history of serious and systematic human rights abuses is well documented, to be ever vigilant and willing to support disciplinary and legal action against them. We also urge your government to use every opportunity to both privately and publicly address the continuing problem of corruption within the Sierra Leonean government.   Regionally, the countries within the Mano River Union remain plagued by violence and instability. Despite the tenuous peace and consequent improvement in the human rights situation in Sierra Leone, hostilities between the government of Liberia, and Guinea-backed dissidents from the Liberians United for the Restoration of Democracy (LURD), have led to serious human rights abuses in Liberia and threaten to undermine peace in Sierra Leone and indeed the region. The region is awash with arms and former combatants from the warring factions in Sierra Leone have been recruited over the past year to fight with both the LURD and Liberian security forces. We urge your government to adopt a regional approach to security, be willing to expose information about arms shipments and pressure governments that allow their territory to be used by proxy armies aimed at destabilizing one another.   Accountability for serious abuses is practically nonexistent and military impunity in all three countries remains a serious problem. The Special Court for Sierra Leone is important, not only to bring those responsible for atrocities during the Sierra Leonean war to account, but also in serving as a future deterrent to regional players. We praise your government's commitment to and investment in the creation of the SCSL. While funds for the court's first year have been secured, there are still shortfalls for the second and third years. We therefore urge you to consider assisting in securing the necessary remaining funds. We also urge you to support a redefinition of UNAMSIL's role to include the protection of the physical premises of the court, assistance with apprehension of those who have been indicted, and security for detainees.   As you are well aware, over one hundred former rebels from the Revolutionary United Front, Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, and Westside boys continue to be held as """"safe-custody"""" detainees without due process guarantees as stipulated under the Sierra Leonean Constitution. We urge you to pressure the government to abide by their obligations under international law, to allow for these detainees to have contact with family and counsel, and to allow RUF leader Foday Sankoh to be visited by delegates from the International Committee of the Red Cross.   We wish you a successful and productive trip.   Sincerely,   Peter Takirambudde Executive Director, Africa Division","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, United Kingdom","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/05/us-president-bush-passes-law-send-colombian-military-aid","US President Bush Passes Law to Send Colombian Military Aid","US President Bush Passes Law to Send Colombian Military Aid","","02/05/2002","EXECUTIVE SUMMARY On January 10, 2002, United States President George W. Bush signed Public Law 107-115, which covers most foreign aid. The legislation included $625 million for the Andean region, most destined for Colombia. A large portion of this aid will be spent on security assistance to the Colombian military. Section 567 of the law establishes specific human rights conditions for military assistance to Colombia (Appendix A). Colombia must meet these conditions in order for aid to be disbursed. As required by law, the State Department held a consultative meeting with nongovernmental organizations in Washington, D.C. that focus on human rights on February 1, 2002. Various groups, including Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA), took part in order to discuss Colombia’s compliance. The United States plays an important role in Colombia and can contribute to the defense of human rights and international humanitarian law. A concern for human rights motivated the U.S. Congress to condition security assistance on clear and convincing progress by Colombia’s government on protecting human rights. These conditions were designed to encourage progress towards compliance with standards that Colombia’s own elected leaders and military commanders say they support. For that reason, the U.S. Congress also removed the waiver option that was included in previous legislation, recognizing that this waiver sent a contradictory and damaging message. If human rights are subject to a waiver, no real commitment to human rights protection exists. Those who continue to abuse human rights understand this message. It is in the interests of both the Colombian and United States governments to ensure that human rights are fully respected in Colombia. Human rights are the foundation of the rule of law and strengthen democracy against its many foes, including those who use terror for political ends. A premature or flawed certification on the human rights conditions contained in aid legislation risks eliminating the leverage the United States has over this critical issue. It would send the message that the U.S. government is willing to turn a blind eye to human rights violations and allow Colombia to continue down a familiar path of impunity, violence, and terror. In the attached document, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and WOLA conclude that Colombia’s government has not, to date, satisfied these conditions. So far, the Colombian government has not suspended security force officers against whom there is credible evidence of human rights abuse or support for paramilitary groups, including extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups; nor has the Colombian Armed Forces demonstrated that they are cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities in prosecuting and punishing in civilian courts those members of the Colombian Armed Forces, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights; nor has Colombia’s government, including the armed forces, taken effective measures to sever all links at the command, battalion, and brigade levels, with paramilitary groups, and execute outstanding orders for capture for members of such groups. To assess compliance, we include benchmarks that were submitted as part of previous certification discussions with the State Department. Disturbingly, Colombia has made very little progress on meeting even these conditions, first discussed over one year ago. We urge the Bush administration to continue to work with its Colombian counterparts to implement immediate and effective measures that satisfy the conditions in P.L. 107-115. Overview Political violence in Colombia increased significantly in 2001, continuing a trend registered the previous year. Colombians fled their homes and even their country in record numbers, facing hunger, the elements, and disease in desperate efforts to save themselves and their families. In the first ten months of the year, the office of the Public Advocate (Defensoría del Pueblo) recorded 92 massacres, which they defined as the killing of three or more people at the same place and at the same time. Most were linked to paramilitary groups working with the tolerance or support of the security forces. Most paramilitaries are allied in the United Self-Defense Groups of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC). Other massacres were perpetrated by anti-government guerrillas. Both paramilitaries and guerrillas reportedly moved with ease throughout the country, including via helicopter. Certain military units and police detachments continued to promote, work with, support, profit from, and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and compatible with their own. At their most brazen, these relationships involved active coordination during military operations between government and paramilitary units; communication via radios, cellular telephones, and beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the names of suspected guerrilla collaborators; the sharing of fighters, including active-duty soldiers serving in paramilitary units and paramilitary commanders lodging on military bases; the sharing of vehicles, including army trucks used to transport paramilitary fighters; coordination of army roadblocks, which routinely let heavily-armed paramilitary fighters pass unchallenged; and payments made from paramilitaries to military officers for their support. In preparation for this consultation, Colombian human rights groups submitted a list of five massacres carried out by paramilitaries in 2001 and January of 2002 in which there is credible evidence that Colombian military units either took direct part or allowed the killings to take place and the perpetrators to escape. Separately, Human Rights Watch received recent, credible, and detailed reports of continued collaboration between the Colombian military and paramilitary groups in the Middle Magdalena region, under the control of the Fifth Brigade and units attached to the Colombian Navy; the southern Pacific coast, under the control of the Third Brigade and units of the Colombian Navy; the department of Putumayo, under the control of the Twenty-Fourth Brigade and units of the Colombian Navy; the Urabá region, under the control of the Seventeenth Brigade and units of the Colombian Navy; and the department of Antioquia, under the control of the Fourth Brigade. These are not isolated incidents, but rather widespread patterns of behavior and collusion. One witness, who asked for anonymity, described collaboration in the Middle Magdalena region in the following manner: “Paramilitaries mount operations with the military’s permission so long as they do not commit atrocities or massacres or senseless killing... The military punishes only the spectacular crimes or paramilitaries are arrested by the military in public displays. At the beginning of the year, the army went into [one town], found a couple of the most criminal paramilitaries, and arrested only one of them. In December, I saw paramilitaries pass a military roadblock as if they were the commanders. This happens every day.” On September 10, 2001, Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that he had included the AUC on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. Subsequently, the United States suspended the visas of suspected AUC members or supporters and put dozens of names on a watch list in cases those individuals applied for visas. In Colombia, there have been some advances on combating paramilitaries, most due to the efforts of the attorney general under the direction of Alfonso Gómez Méndez, who completed his four-year term in July 2001. On May 25, prosecutors seized valuable information related to paramilitary financing networks and communications in the city of Montería, Córdoba, long considered an AUC stronghold. During the raid, prosecutors searched the home of Salvatore Mancuso, a Montería native who was said to be the AUC’s military commander. In part, the investigation focused on how landowners and business people in the region donated heavily to the AUC. However, that progress has been put in serious jeopardy by the policies implemented by Gómez’s replacement, Luis Osorio. Hours after taking office, Osorio objected to the Human Rights Unit’s decision to order the July 23, 2001, arrest of Gen. (ret.) Rito Alejo del Río for his alleged support of  paramilitary groups while in command of the army’s Seventeenth Brigade in Carepa, Antioquia, between 1995 and 1997. Del Río was among the officers dismissed from the army by President Pastrana because of his poor human rights record. Also, the United States canceled his visa to the United States because of his alleged involvement in acts of terrorism and drug trafficking. Osorio claimed that he should have been consulted prior to Del Río’s arrest, even though prosecutors are under no legal requirement to advise the Attorney General prior to making arrests. On August 5, a judge accepted an habeas corpus petition filed on behalf of the former general and ordered his release. Colombian human rights groups have criticized this decision. They argue that an habeas corpus petition, under Colombian law, can only be granted in cases where the legal and constitutional rights of a detained person have been violated, not the case in the arrest of Del Río. Osorio later forced the resignation of the director of the Human Rights Unit, the former director of the Human Rights Unit, and the former head of the Technical Investigations Unit (Cuerpo Técnico de Investigaciones, CTI) during his first hours in office. Several other investigators who worked on the Del Río case have since been forced to leave the country because of threats on their lives. Also in 2001, the single top paramilitary leader arrested in Colombia, Víctor Carranza, was released over the Christmas holidays by a judge who used a legal technicality (vencimiento de términos) to free him. Previously, Attorney General Alfonso Gómez had blocked similar efforts, since Carranza was being prosecuted for the serious charges of forming and directing paramilitary groups, kidnaping, and drug trafficking. Osorio has said to human rights groups as well as members of the U.S. Congress that he believes the work of prosecutors under the direction of then-Attorney General Gómez was biased against paramilitaries and that he planned to refocus the work of the Human Rights Unit toward cases involving guerrilla abuses. In fact, the unit was already pursuing important cases involving both the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (Fuerzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP) and the Camilist Union-National Liberation Army (Unión Camilista-Ejército de Liberación Nacional, UC-ELN). What appeared evident, as 2001 ended, was that Osorio intended to slow or stop advances on important, politically-challenging cases involving the military, among them the Del Río investigation. The Security and National Defense Law that President Andrés Pastrana signed on August 13, 2001, threatened to erode or reverse progress on ending impunity for human rights abuses. The law gave the security forces judicial police powers under certain circumstances and severely restricted the ability of civilian investigators to initiate disciplinary investigations against security force personnel for human rights violations committed during operations. Also, the law limited the obligation of the armed forces to inform judicial authorities about the detention of suspects, increasing the risk of torture. These provisions may facilitate the continued perpetration of abuses in either joint military-paramilitary operations or in paramilitary operations undertaken with the acquiescence of the armed forces. Its passage demonstrates a lack of commitment to ensuring that the armed forces operate within the rule of law and do not aid or abet paramilitary activities. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which visited Colombia in December 2001, said that it remained striking that “the confessed perpetrators of crimes against humanity, with pending orders of arrest against them, move throughout Colombia while giving press interviews.” The Commission also concluded that paramilitaries continue to depend on the active coordination with and the tolerance of units within the security forces. Overall, President Pastrana and his defense ministers have failed to take effective action to establish control over the security forces and break their persistent ties to paramilitary groups.  Even as President Pastrana publicly deplored atrocities, the high-ranking officers he commanded failed to take steps necessary to prevent killings by suspending security force members suspected of abuses, ensuring that their cases were handed over to civilian judicial authorities for investigation and prosecution, and pursuing and arresting paramilitary leaders. CONDITION (1) (A) the Commander General of the Colombian Armed Forces is suspending from the Armed Forces those members, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups. There is no evidence to show that the Commander General of the Colombian Armed Forces is exercising the power held by this office to suspend security force members who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross human rights violations or to have aided and abetted paramilitary groups. To the contrary, our evidence as well as evidence collected by Colombian human rights groups shows that officers against whom there is credible evidence of human rights violations and support for paramilitary groups remain on active duty and in command of troops. The Colombian government has attempted to address this concern by dismissing hundreds of soldiers, often without any public explanation of what crimes these individuals may have committed. In 2000, President Pastrana signed a military penal code reform that gave commanders the power to dismiss subordinates implicated in a wide range of crimes.  The Defense Ministry later claimed that over 500 people have been removed from the service. In its 180-day report filed in September 2001, the State Department asserted that these dismissals marked “a major step forward in promoting greater professionalism and accountability within the Colombian Armed Forces.” However, the Colombian government never provided information indicating the reasons for the dismissals, which could range from incompetence to involvement in human rights crimes. In addition, we are aware of no evidence that any of these individuals subsequently faced criminal investigations or prosecutions for human rights violations. Most of the cases cited publicly by the government – including that of General Rito Alejo del Río, General Fernando Millán, and General Alfonso Bravo Silva – are now several years old. Not a single one of these officers has been effectively prosecuted for their alleged crimes. The same State Department report noted that “In many other cases, however, military personnel were not relieved of their regular duties while under either military ort civilian formal investigation. In some cases, an officer has remained at his post pending the outcome of his appeal, even after the first instance finding (initial judicial finding) was against the officer.” The dismissals may, ironically, lead to more political violence. Former Minister of Defense Luis Ramírez told journalists in 2001 that many dismissed soldiers had probably joined paramilitary forces. Reports indicate that approximately 50 dismissed members of the security forces had immediately joined the AUC. High-ranking officers charged with serious abuses or against whom there is credible evidence of support for or tolerance of paramilitary activity remained on active duty in 2001. Among them are:  General (Navy) Rodrigo Quiñones: Colombian government investigators linked General Quiñones to at least fifty-seven murders of trade unionists, human rights workers, and community leaders in 1991 and 1992, when he was head of Navy Intelligence and ran Network 7, based in Barrancabermeja. A military tribunal decided that there was insufficient evidence against him, meaning that the case remains subject to judicial review and should be transferred back to civilian courts. The only people to be convicted for these crimes were two civilian employees of Network 7, one of whom was later murdered in prison. In his ruling on the case, the civilian judge who sentenced the two civilian employees of the network stated that he was “perplexed” by the military tribunal’s decision, since this judge considered the evidence against them to be “irrefutable…With [this decision] all that [the military] does is justify crime, since the incidents and the people responsible for committing them are more than clear.” This judge also discounted the military’s contention that Quiñones was the victim of a smear campaign by drug traffickers, concluding that there was no evidence to support this claim. The only punishment meted out to Quiñones for the Barrancabermeja killings was a “severe reprimand” ordered by the Procuraduría, Colombia’s Internal Affairs agency, which concluded that he was responsible for setting up and directing the network of assassins responsible for the murders and forced disappearances. In a disputed interpretation of existing norms, the Procuraduría determined that murder is not classified as an administrative infraction in regulations. Therefore, it concluded that the maximum punishment it could impose was a “severe reprimand,” essentially a letter in Quiñones’s employment file. In that decision, the Procuraduría itself described this punishment as “embarrassingly insignificant, both within the national sphere and before the international community.” Since that time, Quiñones has been promoted to important positions of command and influence. As commander of the Navy’s First Brigade, he was in charge of the region where the El Salado (Bolívar) massacre took place in February 2000. Government investigators later concluded that military and police units stationed nearby failed to stop paramilitaries from killing forty-six residents. Also, investigators reported that the Navy established roadblocks that prevented human rights and relief groups from entering the town. Almost one year later, on January 17, 2001, government prosecutors established that Navy First Brigade troops under Quiñones’s command allowed heavily armed paramilitaries to travel past them to the village of Chengue, Sucre. The Washington Post later reported on January 28, 2001, that paramilitaries separated villagers into two groups. “One by one, they killed the men by crushing their heads with heavy stones and a sledgehammer. When it was over, twenty-four men lay dead in pools of blood. Two more were found later in shallow graves. As the troops left, they set fire to the village.” Authorities subsequently arrested Navy Sergeant Rubén Darío Rojas and charged him with supplying weapons to paramilitaries and helping coordinate the attack. On July 6, 2001, the Procuraduría filed disciplinary charges against General Quiñones and five other security force officers for allegedly ignoring detailed information received in advance about paramilitary movements near Chengue. Despite the charges, he was later promoted to the post of navy chief of staff,  the second-highest position within the Colombian Navy. Subsequently, in December 2001, General Quiñones was again promoted, and currently holds the position of vice-rector of the country’s War College, the top officer training school.   General Carlos Ospina Ovalle:  Prosecutors have documented extensive ties between the Fourth Brigade and paramilitary groups between 1997 and 1999, while General Ospina was in command. Among the cases in which Ospina is implicated is the October 1997 El Aro massacre, allegedly perpetrated by Fourth Brigade units in cooperation with paramilitaries. Government investigators documented through eyewitness testimony and other evidence that a joint army-paramilitary force surrounded the village and maintained a perimeter while about twenty-five paramilitaries entered the town, rounded up residents, and executed four people. One of the key investigators on this case, human rights lawyer Jesús Valle, was murdered in 1998 by gunmen linked to the El Aro massacre. Ospina continues to be promoted, and has commanded Mobile Brigade 2 and the Fourth Division. He is currently director of Army Operations.   General Gabriel Díaz: There is abundant and credible evidence to show that under General Díaz’s command, the Twenty-Fourth Brigade regularly worked with and supported paramilitary groups in the department of Putumayo in 2000. Human Rights Watch obtained extensive, detailed, and consistent evidence showing that the Twenty-Fourth Brigade maintained a close alliance with the paramilitaries, resulting in extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, and death threats. The Twenty-Fourth Brigade regularly coordinated actions with paramilitaries and allowed them to operate openly, and even established one of their principal bases within a short walk of an army installation. At their base, paramilitaries held a training camp that drew dozens of novice fighters from across Colombia. Human Rights Watch also collected testimony showing that paramilitaries regularly paid military officers for their cooperation. In one case, evidence suggested that an army officer arranged to have a close relative killed by paramilitaries. In another, Óscar Cardona, a grieving father whose son was murdered by paramilitaries, haggled over a reparations payment that was supervised by Colombian National Police (CNP) officers. To date, government authorities have done little to investigate this alliance or the Colombian Army officers who may have sponsored it. Some soldiers were transferred out of the Putumayo, and one battalion was removed for """"retraining."""" However, the officer who led the Twenty-Fourth Brigade in 2000, was promoted after the report’s publication and now leads the Second Brigade in Barranquilla, Atlántico.   General Freddy Padilla León, Commander of the II Division, and Colonel Gustavo Sánchez Gutiérrez, Army Personnel Director: In July 2000, the Procuraduría formally charged these two officers with “omission” in connection with the massacre in Puerto Alvira in June 1997. But eighteen months later, both remain on active duty.   General Rafael Ruiz: The Attorney General collected compelling and abundant evidence indicating that under his command at the Third Division, the Army’s Third Brigade set up and directed “paramilitary” groups in the departments of Valle del Cauca, Cauca, and Nariño, in southern Colombia.  However, he remains on active duty.   F. General Martín Carreño Sandoval: In case after case, human rights groups, peasant organizations, religious leaders, and residents described a policy of tolerance and, in some cases, open collaboration between the AUC, local police, and units under the command of General Carreño at the Fifth Brigade, based in Bucaramanga. As one international observer commented to Human Rights Watch, “Paramilitaries could not be doing what     they are doing without the support of the military and police.” During a Human Rights Watch mission to the Middle Magdalena in January 2001, eyewitnesses described how paramilitaries had been able to maintain their command center in San Blas, outside the town of San Pablo, throughout 2000. Equipped with communications equipment, barracks, and a vehicle pool, this base was used to summon local leaders, collect and distribute weaponry and vehicles, and train hundreds of paramilitary fighters. After a visit to the region, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights informed the government about this base. Yet it was not searched a single time by the Colombian security forces in 2000, even after Colombians who had independently met with Carlos Castaño on its grounds informed Colombia's highest authorities, including President Pastrana, of its existence. It was not until March 2001 that the Colombian security forces occupied San Blas. At the time, Gen. Carreño announced that his troops had seized a paramilitary “fort,” AK-47 rifles, munitions, and communications equipment. Soldiers also reportedly found five cocaine laboratories, sixteen kilos of raw cocaine, and 22,000 gallons of the chemicals used to crystallize it into export-grade powder. However, not a single paramilitary was arrested, suggesting, as Castaño had previously told visitors, that he received clear advance warning of the raid. Almost immediately after troops left, Human Rights Watch received reliable information that paramilitaries had returned to San Blas and were operating normally.  In order to assess compliance with Condition (1) (A), the United States should obtain a list of the names and ranks of military personnel who have been suspended from duty since August 1997 as a result of credible allegations that they committed gross violations of human rights or aided or abetted paramilitary groups, together with the dates of their suspension. The U.S. Embassy should update this list at three-month intervals and distribute it to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification. Finally, the United States should obtain a list of names and ranks of military personnel who have not been suspended from duty since August 1997 despite credible allegations that they committed gross violations of human rights or aided or abetted paramilitary groups. The U.S. Embassy should update this list at three-month intervals and distribute it to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification. BENCHMARKS : The following should be achieved before the Secretary of State issues a certification on the Colombian government’s compliance with Condition (1) (A):  The Colombian military should suspend the officers within twenty-four hours of receiving credible evidence against them of human rights abuses and/or support for paramilitary groups, pending an investigation by civilian authorities;   If merit is found to the evidence, these officers should be turned over to civilian courts for prosecution for their alleged involvement in gross violations of human rights and paramilitary activities;   The Colombian military should demonstrate that commanding officers who fail to carry out these suspensions and ensure that their subordinates are not in command of troops are themselves sanctioned promptly for dereliction of duty.  CONDITION (1) (B) the Colombian Armed Forces are cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities (including providing requested information, such as the identity of persons suspended from the Armed Forces and the nature and cause of the suspension, and access to witnesses and relevant military documents and other information), in prosecuting and punishing in civilian courts those members of the Colombian Armed Forces, of whatever rank, who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights, including extra-judicial killings, or to have aided or abetted paramilitary groups. The Colombian armed forces continues to adjudicate cases involving allegations of serious human rights violations and block investigations, demonstrating clear noncompliance with this condition. As the State Department has noted in successive annual human rights reports, Colombia’s military tribunals have established a virtually unbroken record of impunity. For example, the investigation into the Chengue massacre – in which General Quiñones is implicated --  was almost derailed in 2001 after attacks and threats on government investigators. Prosecutor Yolanda Paternina Negrete, who led the Chengue investigation, told her superiors that officers in Colombia’s Marine Infantry (Infantería de Marina) failed repeatedly to provide her with the support necessary to search a ranch where witnesses claimed the paramilitaries responsible for the massacre were located. On May 27, two CTI investigators working on the case were detained by paramilitaries and are now presumed dead. Fabio Luis Coley Coronado and Jorge Luis de la Rosa had posed as farm equipment salesmen in an attempt to infiltrate the paramilitary operation. On August 26, 2001, Prosecutor Paternina was herself killed by unidentified gunmen in Sincelejo, Sucre. As insidious, in case after case, the armed forces have simply ignored credible evidence gathered against officers, taking advantage of the country’s slow and often ineffective judicial system to evade accountability. This tactic is particularly effective now, as Attorney General Osorio has slowed down or blocked critical investigations into military support for and tolerance of paramilitary activity. In many regions, prosecutors are simply too afraid to aggressively investigate, fearing both the military and lack of support for their investigations from Attorney General Osorio. The result has been that many cases languish in “preliminary investigations.” These fears grew in 2001 as paramilitaries launched an unprecedented campaign aimed at eliminating government prosecutors, investigators, and witnesses to key cases:  On September 20, Juan Manuel Corzo, the director of the Attorney General’s investigative unit in the city of Cúcuta, Norte de Santander, was shot and killed as he drove with his mother. At the time, Corzo was investigating several killings of colleagues, including prosecutor Margarita Pulgarín, killed in Medellín in 2000, and Iván Villamizar, the former public ombudsman for the city, killed in February;   On September 2, former Apartadó town council member José de Jesús Geman was killed in a Bogotá hotel. Geman was preparing to deliver material to the Attorney General’s office as part of the continuing case against Gen. (ret.) Rito Alejo del Río, who is being investigated for supporting paramilitary groups;   On August 26, prosecutor Yolanda Paternina, in charge of the investigation of the Chengue massacre, was shot and killed in front of her home in Sincelejo, Sucre.  Paternina had reported receiving death threats following her arrest of three local men whom informants linked to the Chengue massacre. In the days following the killings, Chengue survivors implicated Colombian military forces in the massacre;   On July 28, prosecutor María del Rosario Rojas Silva, who was directing a series of investigations into paramilitary activity on the state of Norte de Santander, was shot six times as she left a health clinic in the city of Cúcuta;   On July 11, CTI agent Miguel Ignacio Lora, in charge of an investigation into the financing networks of paramilitary groups, was killed in the city of Montería, Córdoba, by an assassin believed to have been sent by paramilitaries;   On May 27, two investigators for the Attorney General’s office investigating the Chengue massacre were detained by presumed paramilitaries and are now presumed dead. Fabio Luis Coley Coronado and Jorge Luis de la Rosa had posed as farm equipment salesmen n an attempt to infiltrate the paramilitary operation;   On May 17, a former paramilitary pilot who had agreed to testify in a government case was shot and killed in Bogotá by an assassin believed to have been sent by paramilitaries;   On February 12, the former public advocate in the city of Cúcuta, Iván Villamizar, was shot and killed by ten gunmen outside the city’s Free University, where he was serving as president. Paramilitaries had threatened Villamizar for his work as a public advocate. At the time of the attack, Villamizar had two government-assigned bodyguards, who were both seriously wounded in the attack.  The office in Colombia of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights called these killings “a systematic campaign of retaliation and intimidation” by those seeking “total impunity for the most serious crimes committed in the country.” Colombia’s Ministry of Defense has circulated statistics that purport to demonstrate that military tribunals are complying with Colombian law and transferring cases implicating security force members in human rights crimes to civilian jurisdiction. Between August of 1997 and December 2001, the Defense Ministry claims that it transferred 1,372 cases to civilian courts. Despite repeated requests, the Defense Ministry has not provided us with an updated explanation of the charges involved in these cases. However, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reviewed cases transferred prior to 2001, and found that in fact, very few of them could be described as involving military personnel linked to human rights violations. Most involved police agents or allegations of crimes like brawling, theft and drug trafficking, unrelated to human rights or support for paramilitary groups. As the State Department itself has noted, Defense Ministry statistics are notoriously unreliable, occasionally contradictory, and often misleading. In citing them, the State Department’s first 60-day report, filed in November 2000, included a crucial caveat: “It is unclear how many of those cases involve human rights violations.” Often, Defense Ministry statistics prove the very thing they are supposed to deny. For instance, we learned in January 2002 that between October 2000 and October 2001, the Superior Military Tribunal issued eight guilty verdicts for crimes that it described as possible human rights violations. That means that these tribunals continued to adjudicate these cases in violation of the law and a Presidential Directive. Some cases of human rights violations in which high-ranking officers have been implicated have been transferred from military courts but only after the Constitutional Court has issued rulings reiterating its 1997 decision. On July 21, 2000, the Superior Judicial Council (Consejo Superior de Judicatura, CSJ), charged with resolving jurisdictional disputes, among other things, returned a case involving the forced disappearance of Nydia Erika Bautista to civilian courts for trial. Bautista had been detained by members of the army’s Twentieth Brigade in Santafé de Bogotá in August 1987. Although the Attorney General’s Human Rights Unit brought charges against four army members in 1996, the military filed a jurisdictional dispute, which the CSJ decided in the military’s favor that same year. Subsequently, Bautista’s family filed a challenge, which eventually resulted in the case being returned to the CSJ for review. In its July ruling, the CSJ, for the first time, fully embraced Sentence No. C-358/97 and established a crucial precedent. In November 2001 the Constitutional Court built on this precedent by ruling that the Mapiripán  massacre of 1997 should be transferred to the civilian justice system. In this village, paramilitaries coordinating with the army massacred dozens of civilians. The military disputed civilian jurisdiction and in 2000, punished General Jaime Uscátegui with little more than a slap on the hand. General Uscátegui, who retired in 1999, is currently studying law in a military university and has not been rearrested. In order to assess Colombia’s compliance with Condition (1) (B), the U.S. government should obtain from the Colombian government a list of all cases since August 1997 in which military judges have challenged jurisdiction in cases being investigated by the Attorney General’s Office involving gross human rights violations or the aiding and abetting of paramilitary activities, including the charges, the rank of the individuals charged, and the CSJ decision. The U.S. Embassy should update this list at three-month intervals, and distribute it promptly to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification. Also, the U.S. government should obtain a list of the names and ranks of Colombian armed forces personnel who have been brought to justice in Colombia’s civilian courts since August 1997, including the names and ranks of these personnel, details of the charges brought, and the disposition of the cases. The U.S. Embassy should update this list at three-month intervals, and distribute it promptly to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification. Included should be new cases and developments in existing cases, with particular emphasis on whether or not the security forces are cooperating with the execution of arrest warrants. The execution of arrest warrants should be sorted according to the security force units to which they refer. BENCHMARKS: The following benchmarks should be achieved before the Secretary of State issues a certification on the Colombian government’s compliance with Condition (1) (B):  The Colombian military should transfer the cases involving the following military officers to the appropriate civilian authorities for investigation and prosecution and ensure that its members are cooperating, at all levels, with any official inquiries : General (Navy) Rodrigo Quiñones: (see above). General (ret.) Fernando Millán: The Attorney General opened an investigation against General Fernando Millán based on evidence that he set up the Las Colonias CONVIVIR in Lebrija, Santander, while he commanded the Fifth Brigade. The Las Colonias CONVIVIR operated throughout 1997 without the license required by law but with army support, according to the testimony of former members. According to residents and victims’ families, the group committed at least fifteen targeted killings before the director, “Commander Cañón,” a retired army officer, and the  employees he hired were arrested and prosecuted by civilian authorities under Decree 1194, which prohibits the formation of paramilitary groups. Among the cases currently under investigation by the Attorney General’s Office are those of two Protestants, brothers Oscar and Armando Beltrán Correa, who were taken captive by the Las Colonias CONVIVIR as they went to work on July 29, 1997 and killed on the road leading from Lebrija to the hamlet of La Puente. Apparently, the CONVIVIR accused them of passing information to guerrillas. On September 4, 1997, father and son Leonardo and José Manuel Cadena were forced out of their home by CONVIVIR members and killed, according to a family member’s testimony to the Attorney General’s Office. The CONVIVIR apparently accused the Cadenas of providing food to guerrillas. According to a former CONVIVIR member who was also an army informant, during its months of operation, the Las Colonias CONVIVIR frequently went on operations with army units, setting up roadblocks and detaining suspected guerrillas and criminals. When the Attorney General’s Office investigated this case, the army high command prevented prosecutors from questioning Millán, then interposed a jurisdictional dispute, claiming that since Millán was on active service and carrying out his official duties, the case should be tried before a military tribunal. Following a decision by the CSJ, the case was transferred to the military justice system in October 1998.  A prosecutor assigned to investigate the May 1998 massacre of eleven people in Barrancabermeja fled the country after receiving threats from General Millán, then-Commander of the Fifth Brigade. Nine members of the military and police were disciplined in connection with the massacre, but there have been no prosecutions under civilian jurisdiction.  The case against General Millán, now retired,  has not been transferred back to civilian jurisdiction in accordance with Sentence No. 358/97. Brig. Gen. Jaime Canal Albán (ret.): Colombian government investigators found abundant and credible evidence that, in 1999 and 2000, while Brig. Gen. Canal Albán was in command, the Third Brigade set up a paramilitary group and provided its members with weapons and intelligence. To date, the only action taken to break the link between the Third Brigade and paramilitaries has been made by the Attorney General's office. In December 2000, civilian prosecutors arrested Col. Rafael Hani, commander of the Palacé Battalion based in Buga, Valle. Prosecutors told Human Rights Watch that they have strong evidence showing that Hani set up paramilitary groups, supplied them with vehicles and supplies, and coordinated actions with them. They characterized the evidence as “extremely strong, and involving direct support for and participation in paramilitary crimes.” Hani's support for paramilitaries, investigators told Human Rights Watch, “was flagrant.” General (ret.) Jaime Humberto Cortés Parada: In July 2000, the Procuraduría formally charged General Jaime Humberto Cortés Parada with failing to prevent paramilitary attacks in connection with the massacre in Puerto Alvira in June 1997. Subsequently, the Attorney General collected compelling and abundant evidence indicating that under Cortés’s command at the Third Division, the Army’s Third Brigade set up a “paramilitary” group in the department of Valle del Cauca, in southern Colombia. Nevertheless, the army never opened a formal investigation and failed suspend this officer pending its result.      General (ret.) Jaime Uscátegui:  Dozens of civilians were killed by paramilitaries and hundreds were forced to flee for their lives from Mapiripán, Meta, in July 1997. For five days, paramilitaries acting with the support of the army detained residents and people arriving by boat, took them to the local slaughterhouse, then bound, tortured, and executed them by slitting their throats. Local army and police units ignored repeated phone calls from a civilian judge in the area seeking to stop the slayings. At least two bodies -- those of Sinaí Blanco, a boatman, and Ronald Valencia, the airstrip manager -- were decapitated.  Judge Leonardo Iván Cortés reported hearing the screams of people who had been taken to the slaughterhouse to be interrogated, tortured, and killed.  In one message that he sent to various regional authorities while the massacre was in progress, he wrote: “Each night they kill groups of five to six defenseless people, who are cruelly and monstrously massacred after being tortured. The screams of humble people are audible, begging for mercy and asking for help.”  Hundreds of people fled the region. They included Judge Cortés, who was forced to leave Colombia with his family because of threats on his life. Subsequent investigations revealed that troops under the command of Uscátegui, then in charge of the Seventh Brigade, in coordination with Mobile Brigade 2 troops under the command of Colonel Lino Sánchez, assisted the paramilitaries during their arrival at the nearest airport, and made sure that troops with the capability to combat paramilitaries were engaged elsewhere.  In an attempt to cover up his responsibility, Uscátegui tried to falsify documents reporting the massacre. As a result of their internal investigation, the army moved Gen. Uscátegui to administrative duties for failing to act promptly to stop the massacre and detain those responsible. However, the military interposed a jurisdictional dispute arguing that alleged crimes involved “acts of omission” and belonged before a military court. Uscátegui was later convicted by a military tribunal, which sentenced him to 40 months in jail; he served only sixteen months prior to his release. During those sixteen months, he was “confined” in a military recreation facility. In November 2001, however, a tutela filed by the plaintiffs was granted, forcing the case back to civilian courts for retrial. Nevertheless, General Uscátegui, who retired in 1999, is currently studying law in a military university and has not been rearrested. General (ret.) Alberto Bravo Silva:  According to Colombia’s Public Advocate, on May 29, 1999, paramilitaries killed at least twenty people and abducted up to fifteen more in La Gabarra (Norte de Santander). General Bravo was repeatedly warned of the paramilitaries’ threats against villagers and the ensuing massacres, but did not act to prevent them or to pursue the perpetrators effectively once the massacre had taken place. He was relieved of duty and later retired, but has not been prosecuted in a civilian court for his alleged role in aiding and abetting this atrocity. General (ret.) Rito Alejo del Río: An investigation was opened by the Attorney General in 1998 into Del Río’s support and tolerance for paramilitary activity in the Urabá region in 1996 and 1997 while he was commander of the Seventeenth Brigade. According to reports made by Colonel (ret.) Carlos Velásquez, his chief of staff, to his superiors in 1996, Del Río supported paramilitaries in Urabá, and maintained a relationship with a retired army major who worked with paramilitaries.  Instead of prompting a serious investigation of Del Río, the reports prompted the army to investigate Velásquez, in an apparent attempt to silence him. The army concluded the inquiry by recommending not that Gen. Del Río, who was later promoted, be punished, but that Colonel Velásquez be disciplined for “insubordination, [acts] against duty and esprit de corps.” Velásquez was forced to retire on January 1, 1997. General Del Río was arrested in July 2001, but was quickly released after a judge granted a dubious writ of habeas corpus. Now in the hands of Attorney General Osorio, it appears unlikely that the case will proceed. In September 2001, a witness in the case against  Del Río was killed in Bogotá.  General (ret.) Farouk Yanine Díaz: Gen. Yanine was arrested in October 1996 for alleged complicity in the massacre of nineteen merchants in the Middle Magdalena region in 1987. Eyewitnesses, including a military officer, testified that he supported paramilitaries who carried out the massacre and had operated in the area since 1984, when Yanine was commander of the Fourteenth Brigade in Puerto Berrio. The paramilitary leader also testified that Gen. Yanine had paid him a large sum to carry out the killing. Yanine also allegedly provided paramilitaries with the intelligence necessary to intercept their victims. Despite compelling evidence, General Manuel José Bonnet, then the  army commander, closed the case citing a lack of evidence and opposed sending the case to civilian courts for trial. The Procuraduría appealed the decision on the grounds that “evidence presented against Yanine Díaz had not been taken into account --  [the sentence] clearly deviates from the evidence presented in this case.” The U.S. State Department expressed concern about the acquittal on July 1, 1997.    The Colombian military should transfer to the appropriate civilian authorities for investigation and prosecution cases involving human rights abuses and/or support for paramilitary groups that are under investigation by military tribunals or that have not reached the stage of final appeal and resolution. They remain subject to Sentence No. C-358/97, among them the following cases that we consider benchmarks for measuring Colombia’s compliance with Condition (1) (B): Massacres at Trujillo (Valle del Cauca):  Dozens of people were killed in the municipality of Trujillo over a several year period in the late 1980s and early 90s.  On December 20, 1990, the Third Brigade dropped charges that had been leveled against Major Alirio Antonio Urueña. The Colombian president later cashiered him on human rights grounds. Further cases arising from the Trujillo killings remain in military courts. The paramilitary leader widely reported to have participated, Henry Loaiza Ceballo, the “Scorpion,”  is not known to have been convicted for his role in this case. Massacre at El Caloto (Cauca):  This massacre, in which twenty members of Páez indigenous community were killed, was carried out on December 16, 1992 by the Judicial Police. The military challenged jurisdiction and the case was transferred to military jurisdiction at the end of 1997. Charges against the implicated officials were dropped, and the case remains subject to the Constitutional Court ruling. Massacre at Riofrío (Valle del Cauca):  Thirteen people were killed in the village of El Bosque, in the Municipality of Riofrío on October 5, 1993 by men in uniforms and ski masks.  The victims were presented as combat deaths by Battalion Palacé of the Third Brigade, based in Cali.  The case was initially transferred to the military court system by a 1994 CSJ decision.  A civilian judge then requested that the military justice system transfer to him the portion of the case brought against several military officials.  The military justice system refused to grant the transfer, and the matter returned to the CSJ.  In July 1998, the CSJ refused to decide the conflict on the grounds that it had already decided the jurisdictional question in 1994. This case remains open to review. Blanquicet (Antioquia): On September 22, 1993, in the rural district of Blanquicet, members of the Colombian army killed Carlos Manuel Prada and Evelio Bolano, members of the armed opposition group Socialist Renovation Current, (Corriente de Renovación Socialista, CRS) who had been acting as peace negotiators. The CRS later demobilized. An army captain, sergeant, and several soldiers were acquitted by the military justice system. This decision was appealed by the lawyers acting for the families and by the CRS on jurisdictional grounds, and they requested the transfer of the case to the Attorney General in compliance with the Constitutional Court's ruling. The request was rejected but the rejection was appealed, whereupon the Superior Military Tribunal confirmed the decision to deny the transfer. The Attorney General’s Human Rights then requested the transfer of the case on jurisdictional grounds. The case is also before the Inter-American Commission, which has agreed to a “friendly settlement” on condition that the criminal investigation is transferred to the civilian justice system. San José de Apartadó (Antioquia): Threats and human rights violations against the community of San José de Apartadó (Antioquia) by army-backed paramilitaries continued in 2001, prompting a series of formal investigations. Paramilitaries attacked the village on March 5, setting fire to houses and threatening to kill the inhabitants and members of an international non-governmental organization who were with them. The gunmen apparently came from an area that a patrol of the Seventeenth Brigade had just left. Soldiers from this brigade have recently been seen patrolling with known paramilitaries, and have reportedly threatened people living in San José de Apartadó. Soldiers entered the village about 25 minutes after the gunmen left, but made no attempt to pursue them. All portions of this case should remain within civilian jurisdiction. Santo Domingo (Arauca): There is credible evidence that a Colombian Air Force crew flying a U.S.-funded combat helicopter committed a serious violation in the village of Santo Domingo in 1998, by rocketing a house where civilians had taken shelter. The helicopter was assigned to Combat Air Command No. 1, for almost a decade a recipient of U.S. security assistance. The military reacted to evidence of an abuse by disseminating false or contradictory information and misleading civilian investigators. In addition, the Air Force commander, Gen. Héctor Velasco, criticized the human rights groups demanding justice for the victims, openly equating them with guerrillas and drug traffickers. The incident occurred on the morning of December 13, 1998, after over a day of combat around the village between the military and the FARC-EP’s Tenth Front. At about 9:45 a.m., an explosion in Santo Domingo killed seven children. Twenty-eight eyewitnesses told local authorities that the explosion was the result of a rocket fired from a Colombian military helicopter. They said that the Colombian military dropped at least two other explosives in Santo Domingo. Eleven adults were also reported killed.   The Colombian Army closed its preliminary investigation (archivado). Meanwhile, the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit collected forensic evidence that was reviewed by  Colombian experts and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Both agreed that the remains of an American-made rocket were present in the samples.  As a result, the Attorney General's Human Rights unit recommended that the Colombian Air Force reopen its investigation. However, the air force declared that ruling null the following September. Subsequently, the Attorney General requested that the case be returned to civilian jurisdiction, and a decision is pending. Almost two years after the incident, Colombian Air Force Gen. Héctor Fabio Velasco filed a complaint of “calumny” (calumnia) against members of Humanidad Vigente, a local human rights group, and the Arauca-based “Joel Sierra” Regional Human Rights Committee, which is on-going. The charge is based on a  poster that the groups sponsored that called for justice for the attack, which the groups attributed to the Colombian Air Force. The poster features a child's drawing of the attack, with black helicopters and yellow airplanes loosing bombs over the figures of Santo Domingo villagers. General Velasco also publicly attacked the Colombian human rights groups pressing for justice by equating them to guerrillas, a common tactic by military officers to discredit and threaten human rights defenders. El Aro (Antioquia): Colombian prosecutors collected evidence linking the Fourth Brigade, under the command of General Carlos Ospina Ovalle, to the October 25, 1997, massacre committed by paramilitaries in El Aro. Government documents show that a joint army-paramilitary force surrounded the village and maintained a perimeter while about twenty-five paramilitaries entered the town, rounded up residents, and executed four people. Angel Quintero and Claudia Monsalve: Investigations into the “disappearance” of these human rights defenders on October 6, 2000, in Medellín have unearthed  evidence that  the Unified Action Groups for Personal Security (Grupo de Acción Unificada para la Libertad Personal, GAULA), a joint army-police anti-kidnapping force, were responsible for illegal tapping of thousands of phone lines including those of the Association of Family Members of the Detained-Disappeared (Asociación De Familiares de Detenidos y Desaparecidos, ASFADDES) and numerous other organizations. The Attorney General’s office has, to date, issued arrest warrants against at least four police officers and summoned two police colonels for questioning.     CONDITION (1) (C) the Colombian Armed Forces are taking effective measures to sever links (including by denying access to military intelligence, vehicles, and other equipment or supplies, and ceasing other forms of active or tacit cooperation), at the command, battalion, and brigade levels, with paramilitary groups, and to execute outstanding orders for capture for members of such groups. The Colombian government’s progress against paramilitary groups has amounted to little more than rhetoric, unsupported by actions in the field designed either to break existing ties between the military and paramilitary groups, prosecute the officers who support these links, or pursue those groups and their leaders effectively in the field. Although the government describes these ties as the result of the acts of “individual members of the security forces,” and not a matter of policy or even tolerance, it is abundantly clear that the range of acts government prosecutors and human rights investigators continue to document depend on the approval, collusion and tolerance of high-ranking officers. The Colombian government claims major improvements in curtailing abuses by paramilitaries and arresting their members. But the facts do not bear out these assertions. Arrest statistics provided by the military are overwhelmingly skewed toward low-ranking members of paramilitary groups or individuals whose participation in these groups is alleged, not proven. The vast majority of arrest warrants for paramilitaries issued by the Attorney General’s office languish without action. In the words of one top government investigator, “There are cases where we cannot execute warrants against paramilitaries because we lack the military weaponry to confront them… [When the Colombian military is involved ] the information leaks [to paramilitaries] and when we arrive, nobody is there. In many cases, the military knows exactly where the paramilitaries are, but does nothing.” Meanwhile, the AUC expanded its radius of action and troop strength dramatically in 2001. Since 1996, the number of paramilitaries has grown by over 560 percent, and Carlos Castaño, their principal leader, now claims a force of over 11,000 fighters. In 2001, Castaño published a memoir in which he took responsibility for a series of killings, among them of presidential candidate Carlos Pizarro. In some situations, as with the temporary seizure of a community of displaced people in Esperanza en Díos and Nueva Vida, Chocó, paramilitaries reportedly operated with as many as 800 troops at a time. Large concentrations of paramilitaries were rarely challenged by the Colombian security forces. Over a period of a week in early July 2001, in the town of Peque, Antioquia, over 500 armed and uniformed paramilitaries blockaded roads, occupied municipal buildings, looted, cut all outside communication, and prevented food and medicines from being shipped in, according to the Public Advocate’s office. Over 5,000 Colombians were forced to flee. When the paramilitaries left, church workers counted at least nine dead and another ten people “disappeared,” several of them children. As a local official said: “The state abandoned us. This was a massacre foretold. We alerted the regional government the paramilitaries were coming and they didn't send help.” During much of 2000, the AUC paid monthly salaries based on rank to local Colombian army and police officials in the department of Putumayo, where U.S.-funded and trained counternarcotics battalions were deployed. In the state of Cauca, soldiers moonlighting as paramilitaries earned up to $500 per month. These salaries far exceeded the average Colombian’s monthly income. Mayors, municipal officials, governors, human rights groups, the Public Advocate’s office and even some police detachments regularly informed the appropriate authorities about credible threats by paramilitaries or even massacres that were taking place. An early warning system paid for by the United States and administered by the office of the Public Advocate registered twenty separate warnings nationwide between June 2001, when the system began to function, and September 2001. But rarely did the government take effective action to prevent atrocities. Of the warnings that were received, eleven incidents resulted either in killings being committed or the continued, pronounced presence of armed groups that threatened civilians. Far from mobilizing government forces to act, the early warning system has left a highly mixed record of inaction. As disturbing, some security force commanders have accused the civilians who activate the network of using it to distract attention and help guerrillas focus attacks on areas left unprotected after soldiers are moved to address supposedly spurious threats. Paramilitaries were linked to the murders of Colombians working to foster peace, among them three congressmen: Representative Jairo Rojas, killed on September 6, 2001; Representative Octavio Sarmiento, killed by the AUC on October 2, 2001; and Representative Luis Alfredo Colmenares, killed by the AUC on October 8, 2001. On June 2, armed men believed to be paramilitaries seized Kimy Pernia Domicó, a leader of the Emberá-Katío community in the department of Córdoba, who remained “disappeared” at this writing. Three weeks after he was abducted, another Emberá-Katío leader who had been active in calls for Domicó’s release was abducted by presumed paramilitaries and later killed. As these killings showed, certain groups faced special risks, among them indigenous groups, trade unionists, journalists, human rights defenders, and peace advocates. 2001 was the worst year ever for trade unionists, for example, with 152 reported killed and thirty-three forcibly disappeared. The AUC has publicly threatened leaders, among them former CUT president and presidential candidate Luis Garzón, who the government confirmed in December 2001 was the target of a paramilitary assassination attempt. In some cases, government investigations continued to reveal links between active-duty and retired members of the security forces, known paramilitaries and professional killers, and attacks on trade unionists, among them the failed attempt on the life of Wilson Borja, the president of the State Workers’ Union,  on December 15, 2000.  In December 2001, the Attorney General’s Office charged army intelligence informant Juan Evangelista Basto Bernal with conspiracy and attempted murder. In his home, investigators discovered material linking him to possible plans to attack human rights lawyer Alirio Uribe and noted academic Alejo Vargas. Active duty army Major César Alfonso Maldonado Vidales remains under investigation in connection with the attack and is detained in a military police barracks. However, it remains unclear whether or not he is suspended; in previous cases, officers in the same facility have continued to engage in their regular duties, and have been allowed to come and go from their supposed cells at will. Some government offices attempted to protect threatened Colombians, supplying bodyguards, bulletproof reinforcement for offices, and an emergency response network operated by handheld radios. The CNP Human Rights office and the Interior Ministry, in particular, took steps to protect defenders and to investigate specific allegations of police collaboration with paramilitary groups. In many instances, however, government response was slow, nonexistent, or abusive. For example, the commander of the Barrancabermeja-based CNP, Col. José Miguel Villar Jiménez, attacked human rights groups in 2001 by claiming that they had their “origin in [guerrillas], which attempt to throw mud on the good work that is done constantly with reports and information that also has an echo in the different international Non-Governmental Organizations.” None of the cases that we forwarded as benchmarks for previous certifications have resulted in the arrests of the individuals who planned, coordinated, and paid for the murders of human rights defenders or government prosecutors. Only the actual gunmen and women have been arrested or convicted, while abundant evidence points to others as having ordered these attacks. The security forces have been directly implicated in abuses related to human rights defenders. In May 2000, it was revealed that a combined police-army unit had illegally tapped over 2,000 telephone lines in the city of Medellín, many belonging to non-governmental and human rights groups, among them ASFADDES.  The police officer who apparently helped place the taps was killed in April 2001 in circumstances that remained unclear. In November 2001, the Procuraduría filed charges against twelve police officers in connection to this case. The Attorney General’s Office has to date issued arrest warrants against at least four police officers and summoned two police colonels for questioning. In addition, high-ranking military officers continue to verbally attack U.S. officials (who by law are required to investigate allegations of human rights abuses), journalists, and human rights defenders. For example, after Human Rights Watch published The ‘Sixth Division’: Military-Paramilitary Ties and U.S. Policy in Colombia, General Rafael Ruiz, commander of the Cali-based Third Division, falsely accused Human Rights Watch’s Americas Division Executive Director José Miguel Vivanco of receiving drug trafficking money in order to launch false accusations. “We know that [Vivanco] is sent checks from [Colombia] and we have proof and it has been demonstrated,” General Ruiz told journalists in October 2001. Many paramilitary bases remain fixed and their locations are well known, yet the security forces  do nothing to dismantle the bases, prevent them from being used to commit crimes, or arrest those responsible. Witnesses have reported that paramilitaries cross through local army roadblocks frequently. According to sworn testimony of the local personero, the municipal authority charged with receiving reports of abuses from the citizenry, local army and police officers held regular meetings with paramilitary leaders in the army base attached to the Twenty-Fourth Brigade in 2000. The government has repeatedly claimed that it has set up special units to pursue paramilitaries, but these groups appeared to be little more than paper tigers. In order to assess compliance with this condition, the United States should obtain a list of outstanding arrest warrants issued by the Attorney General relating to human rights cases. The U.S. Embassy should update it at three-month intervals, and distribute it promptly to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification. New cases should be included as well as developments in existing cases, in particular, whether the security forces are taking concrete measures to execute these warrants. The execution of arrest warrants should be sorted according to the security force units to which they refer. Also, the United States should obtain a list of the names of paramilitary leaders and members who have been indicted, arrested, and prosecuted since August 1997; a description of the charges brought; and the disposition of the cases. The U.S. Embassy should update it at three-month intervals, and distribute it promptly to the appropriate congressional committees and the human rights groups included in the consultation process required for certification.  Included should be new cases and developments in existing cases, with particular emphasis on whether or not the security forces are taking concrete measures to execute warrants.  Information regarding the execution of arrest warrants should be sorted according to the security force units to which they refer. BENCHMARKS: The following benchmarks should be achieved before the Secretary of State issues a certification on the Colombian government’s compliance with Condition (1) (C).  The Colombian government should present to the public a comprehensive plan that is fully funded and staffed and includes a long-term and politically feasible strategy to pursue and disband paramilitary groups, arrest and prosecute their leaders, and seize their financial and other assets according to law.   The Colombian military should adopt a strategy to immediately and effectively execute outstanding arrest warrants related to the following benchmark cases. Alirio de Jesus Pedraza Becerra:  Pedraza, a lawyer with the Committee of Solidarity with Political Prisoners (Comité de Solidaridad con Presos Políticos, CSPP), was “disappeared” by eight heavily armed men on July 4, 1990.  His whereabouts have never been determined.

Four judicial police and a key witness have reportedly been murdered in the course of the investigation. Jesús María Valle Jaramillo, “Héctor Abad Gómez” Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights: Valle was assassinated on February 27, 1998 by unidentified gunmen, after repeatedly denouncing military/paramilitary links. Despite strong indications of military involvement in the crime, no formal investigation has been opened against military personnel.

Yolanda Cerón, Pepe Zabala, and Angela Andrade, Pastoral Social: Yolanda Cerón, a nun and human rights defender with the Pastoral Social of the Catholic Church, was killed by two gunmen thought to be members of army-backed paramilitary forces in Tumaco (Nariño), on September 19, 2001. Since the previous year, paramilitaries had been threatening human rights defenders in Tumaco. The killing of Yolanda Cerón followed the killing on August 6 of Pepe Zabala and Angela Andrade in the  Aguaclara district of the municipality of Tumaco. Both were members of the Multi-ethnic People’s Movement of the Nariño Pacific Coast (Movimiento Popular Multiétnico De La Vertiente Del Pacífico Nariñense). There have been no arrests in this case.

On July 18, Eduardo Estrada, also with PDPMM, was murdered in the town of San Pablo, Bolívar. There have been no arrests in this case. The United States should insist upon the capture and effective detention of alleged material and intellectual authors of gross human rights violations against whom there are arrest warrants, including military officers and paramilitary leaders, among them:   Carlos Castaño Gil, AUC:  Castaño has been implicated in the deaths of thousands of Colombians, either through direct order or as the result of operations he has planned and led as the founder and primary leader of the AUC. Despite Castaño’s public appearances, including frequent media interviews in 2000 and 2001 and the recent publication of a memoir, Colombian law enforcement agencies have not executed dozens of pending warrants for his arrest.   Alexander """"El Zarco"""" Londoño, Las Terrazas: Londoño was the head of a group of professional killers that worked with Carlos Castaño and is wanted in connection with a series of killings and kidnappings, including the 1999 kidnappings of four Medellín-based human rights workers. There are several warrants for his arrest.    Julian Duque:  Duque is the paramilitary leader of the Autodefensas del Sur de Bolívar and is wanted for organizing paramilitary groups.   Gabriel Salvatore “El Mono” Mancuso Gómez: Mancuso is considered the leader of the United Self-Defense Force of Córdoba and Urabá (Autodefensas Unidas de Córdoba y Urabá, ACCU) and is a close associate of Castaño’s in the AUC.   Ramón Isaza Arango: A veteran paramilitary leader, Isaza is wanted for paramilitary activity in the Middle Magdalena region.   Luis Eduardo “El Aguila” Cifuentes Galindo: Cifuentes is the paramilitary leader of the Autodefensas de Cundinamarca and is wanted for organizing paramilitary groups.   Diego Fernando Murillo Bejerano:  Murillo is allegedly responsibly for a series of kidnappings in and around Medellín, carried out in association with the AUC.   Rodrigo Tovar Pupo, “El  Papa”: This paramilitary leader from the region around Valledupar, Cesar, is wanted by the Attorney General for organizing paramilitary groups and is connected with the AUC.   Víctor Burgos Vellojín: A reputed paramilitary leader from the region around Valledupar, Cesar, he is wanted by the authorities.   Lino Arias  Paternina: A reputed paramilitary leader from the region around Valledupar, Cesar, he is wanted by the authorities.   Gustavo Adolfo Upegui: The authorities believe that Upegui is a major financial supporter of the AUC. He is wanted by the authorities.   Omar Yesud López Alarcón: Reputedly the head of the northern branch of the AUC, López escaped from the prison in Cúcuta, Norte de Santander, on May 17, 2001. He was detained at the end of 2000, accused of masterminding a number of massacres in north‑east Colombia. Later, he escaped and remains at large.   Martín Villa Montoya: Villa allegedly took part in the El Salado massacre in 2000. He fled the prison where he was kept in March 2001, only days after the Attorney General’s Human Rights Unit filed formal charges against him and fourteen others believed to have killed thirty-six people.   Jorge Ivan Laverde Zapata, alias “Sebastian” or “El Iguano”: On November 22, 2000, accused AUC member Laverde was reportedly undergoing a medical procedure in a hospital when a group of thirty AUC members arrived to escort him to freedom. Although Laverde was believed to be a paramilitary commander and confidant of Carlos  Castaño’s, it appears that the security force members charged with guarding him took no special measures to prevent his escape or to detain the AUC gunmen. At the time of his second escape, Laverde reportedly had a total of three arrest warrants filed against him for homicide and paramilitary activities, and was believed to be a commander of the AUC in North Santander department.   Salomon Feris Chadid: a retired military officer linked to killings in the department of Sucre, Feris left detention several weeks after his August 2000 arrest.   Francisco Javier Piedrahita: Piedrahita was arrested and accused of financing paramilitaries along Colombia’s Caribbean Coast. Escorted to a Barranquilla clinic for a medical procedure, he left unmolested on December 31, 1999.   Humberto Caicedo Grosso: This alleged paramilitary, known as “H.K.,” was able to leave the army’s Sixteenth Brigade, in Yopal, Casanare, two days after his arrest on February 18, 2000. Caicedo was later implicated in the largest hostage-taking ever recorded in Colombia, the May 16, 2001 seizure of 198 African palm workers in the department of Casanare. All of the workers were later reported released.   Héctor Buitrago, alias “Tripas”: Buitrago was arrested in connection with an attack on a government judicial commission outside San Carlos de Guaroa, Meta, on October 3, 1997, that left eleven dead. The commission had intended to seize a ranch belonging to an alleged drug trafficker and financer of paramilitary groups. Buitrago escaped while being taken from a Villavicencio jail to a local hospital after complaining of symptoms of a heart attack.   Jacinto Soto Toro, alias “Lucas” or “Aníbal”: Soto, reputedly a top AUC accountant, walked out of Medellín’s Bellavista Prison on November 2, 1998. Arrested on April 30, 1998, by the CTI, Soto was found in an office that authorities said did the paramilitaries’ accounting and contained many documents relating to checking accounts, sham businesses, and the names of Colombians who had donated money or other goods. According to the prison director, Soto was able to leave the prison because he had a false document signed by a local prosecutor that authorized guards to release him.   Hernán Giraldo: this paramilitary leader operates in the department of Magdalena and the Santa Marta area, and has been linked to over a dozen murders and attacks. According to Newsweek magazine, Giraldo and his Los Chamizos gunmen have not only traffic in cocaine, but also have sponsored a rule of terror.               APPENDIX A SEC. 567.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/04/saudi-arabia-new-evidence-torture","Saudi Arabia- New Evidence Of Torture","Saudi Arabia: New Evidence Of Torture","","02/04/2002","The government of Saudi Arabia should take immediate steps to investigate and prosecute members of the internal security forces responsible for torturing detainees and prisoners, Human Rights Watch said today.  Human Rights Watch said any Saudi investigation should include the perpetrators of torture as well as public officials who instigated, consented, or acquiesced to the acts.  The most recent allegations of torture and other cruel or inhuman treatment in Saudi Arabia came from three British citizens who were released in December 2001, after being held for over twelve months. Two described torture under interrogation at an interior ministry facility in an article published in The Guardian (London) on January 30.  Saudi interior minister Prince Nayef bin Abdel Aziz responded by claiming that there was “no truth” to the allegations, which he said were “part of the media campaign against the kingdom.”  “Blanket denials of torture from senior Saudi officials only compound the problem and perpetuate a culture of impunity among security forces,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The practice of torture in Saudi Arabia is well-documented, and the government is legally obligated to investigate these recent allegations.”  Torture is prohibited under Saudi law and international human rights law. In October 1997, Saudi Arabia became a state party to the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the convention’s provisions became part of Saudi domestic legislation.  Background  The three Britons, Paul Moss, David Mornin, and Kelvin Hawkins, were arrested in the wake of a series of bombings in Riyadh and Khobar. The bombings, which began in November 2000, killed one British citizen and injured others. Saudi authorities maintained that the violence was a consequence of turf wars among expatriates involved in the illegal but highly lucrative alcohol trade in the kingdom. Six other foreigners, one Canadian, one Belgian, and four Britons, continue to be held on suspicion of involvement in these incidents, but have not yet been charged or tried. Three of them were shown on Saudi state television on February 4, 2001, “confessing” to the bombings; the remaining three made similar “confessions” that were aired on August 13, 2001.  Moss and Mornin told the Guardian of severe physical abuse, and all three men said that they had been subjected to sleep deprivation while under interrogation:  Paul Moss, who was arrested in December 2000, described how he was treated while in the custody of the interior ministry at a facility in Riyadh, the Saudi capital, where he said he was held in solitary confinement for seven weeks. “I did not have a name: I was just addressed as a number throughout by an interrogator who was obviously well-educated. Every time I was taken from the windowless cell two floors up for interrogation I was blindfolded and shackled.” He told the Guardian that he was deprived of sleep, and beaten on four separate occasions: “They hit me in the testicles with a stick. Then they hit me on the chin each time as I went down.” Moss also alleged that he was intimidated and threatened: “They took me on the roof and said they would throw me off and say I'd been trying to escape. They said they'd done that before. They threatened to plant drugs in my house to get my wife and child beheaded.”  David Mornin, who was arrested in November 2000, said that he was held in solitary confinement in a punishment cell for eight weeks “with the light burning all the time.” He told the Guardian that he too was subjected to physical abuse and threats while in interior ministry custody, in attempts to elicit a confession: “They flung me off the walls, punched me in the gut, kicked me in the ribcage... they hammered me. They threatened to gang rape my wife, to plant drugs on her, they said they would take me to the desert and cut my throat and leave me there.” He continued: “They kick you awake, make you sit down, then stand up about every 15 minutes.” Mornin also described how he was suspended: “They hung me from bars above the door by my handcuffs so I was just on the balls of my feet for 24 hours at a time. They did that on four occasions.” He said that when he was released he “had to write a thank you note to the king, and sign to say I had not been mistreated.”  Kelvin Hawkins, arrested in November 2000, told the Guardian he was not physically abused, possibly because his wife told Saudi authorities he had undergone a quadruple bypass. “What happened to me was sleep deprivation, I was hand cuffed, shackled and blindfolded and held in solitary confinement for three months,” he said. “Initially they tried to get me to confess to the bombings. After I confessed to running [an illegal] bar they stopped asking about the bombings,” he said.  ***  Saudi Arabia reported to the U.N. Committee against Torture in February 2001 that the regulations in the kingdom “prohibit all forms of torture.” The government cited article 28 of the Prison and Detention Regulations, which states: “All forms of aggression against prisoners or detainees are prohibited and disciplinary measures shall be taken against civilian or military officials who commit any act of aggression against prisoners or detainees, without prejudice to any criminal penalties to which they might be liable in cases in which such aggression constitutes a criminal offense.” The government also noted that article 100 of the Statutes of the Directorate of Public Security stipulates the following: “The investigating officer shall be vigilant and shall endeavor, by various judicious means, to ascertain the underlying reason for the suspect’s persistence or silence without resorting to coercion or torture.” In addition, the government cited article 231 of the Statutes: “Anyone who is found to be responsible for the unjustified detention of, or infliction of harm on, any person shall be punished by a term of detention equivalent to that for which he was responsible and shall also be liable for any harm that he inflicted.”  The Saudi government also informed the U.N. Committee against Torture in February 2001 that the Convention against Torture, “having been ratified by Royal Decree, forms part of the domestic legislation, as a result of which its provisions can be invoked before the courts and the other judicial and administrative authorities of the Kingdom.” Article 12 of the convention requires Saudi Arabia to “ensure that its competent authorities proceed to a prompt and impartial investigation, wherever there is reasonable ground to believe that an act of torture has been committed in any territory under its jurisdiction.” Article 4 of the convention stipulates that complicity, as well as participation, in torture must be considered offenses under criminal law, and that each state party “shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.”","Middle East/North Africa, Saudi Arabia",""

The groups presented their findings at a meeting with the U.S. State Department on February 1.  By the end of February, Secretary of State Colin Powell must decide if he can certify that the Colombian government has met these conditions. By law, he must certify before the U.S. government can release up to $625 million in new aid. If Secretary Powell determines that he cannot certify Colombia, aid would be suspended pending significant progress on improving human rights guarantees.  Human Rights Watch, WOLA, and Amnesty International found overwhelming evidence of the Colombian government's failure to meet the human rights conditions. The human rights monitoring organizations found, among other things:  The Colombian government has failed to suspend members of the Colombian Armed Forces credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights or to have helped paramilitary groups; The Colombian Armed Forces, in particular the army and navy, continue to organize, coordinate with, share information with, support, and tolerate paramilitary groups; The Colombian Armed Forces are not cooperating with civilian prosecutors and judicial authorities to investigate reports of abuses or to pursue and capture known paramilitaries.","Americas, Colombia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/02/01/sudan-justice-stonings-amputations","Sudan Justice- Stonings Amputations","Sudan Justice: Stonings, Amputations","Human Rights Watch Letter","02/01/2002","Lieutenant General Omar Hassan El Bashir  President of the Republic of Sudan  People's Palace  P.O. Box 281  Khartoum  Sudan   Your Excellency,   We are writing to express our deep concern over a ruling by a criminal court in Nyala, southern Darfur, that sentenced Abok Alfa Akok to death by stoning after finding her guilty of adultery. We are equally concerned about the use of amputations as a punishment, also in Darfur.    Death Penalty and Fair Trial    As an international organization committed to the defense of basic human rights, we oppose the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty and irreversibility. We are also concerned about the fair trial violations surrounding Ms. Akok's trial. We urge you to intervene on her behalf to prevent this cruel and inhuman punishment from being exercised against her. We also ask that she be provided a new trial in compliance with international standards of fair trial, if the charges against her are not dismissed on appeal or otherwise.   The cornerstone of human rights is respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person. These principles cannot be reconciled with the death penalty, a form of punishment that is unique in its barbarity and finality. Stoning to death is additionally painful and brutal. Furthermore, article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Sudan ratified in March 1986, strictly prohibits the carrying out of capital punishment on a pregnant woman.   Based on information from reliable sources, on December 8, 2001, a criminal court in Nyala, southern Darfur, sentenced to death by stoning eighteen-year-old Abok Alfa Akok, a Christian woman from the Dinka tribe, after finding her guilty of adultery. Ms. Akok was pregnant at the time of her conviction. She did not have legal representation during the trial. The trial was conducted in Arabic, which is not her language, and there was no translation of the proceedings in order to ensure that she understood fully the case against her. The man with whom she allegedly had sex was not tried, because the court lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him. The case is now on appeal.   Amputations    We would also like to express our condemnation of the cruel and inhuman punishment of limb amputations, most recently applied by emergency courts established under the state of emergency. Based on reliable reports, in December 2001 at least six men in the states of Northern and Southern Darfur have been sentenced to limb amputations.   We request that you intervene in these cases, as both the cruelty of amputation and questions of fair trial raise concern in all these convictions. Article 7 of the ICCPR states, No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Limb amputations are cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment in that they mutilate the convicted person, subject him to discrimination and isolation, and disable him from most gainful employment.   On December 12, 2001, a special emergency tribunal in Nyala, Sourthern Darfur convicted Abdu Ismail Tong and Yousif Yaow Mombai of stealing three million Sudanese pounds (approximately U.S. $1160). They confessed while in police custody, but later denied the crime, raising serious concern about the possibility of confession under duress. They were not allowed to be represented by advocates during their trial, and the court sentenced them to amputation of the right hand.   On December 25, 2001, a special emergency tribunal in Alfahir City in Darfur sentenced Mohamed Adam Yahya and Ahmed Suleiman Mohamed to amputation of the right hand followed by death by hanging. They were convicted of armed robbery.   On December 27, 2001, Adam Ibrahim Osman and Abd Allaha Ismail Ibrahim from the town of Um Kadada were sentenced to cross amputation, i.e., amputation of the right hand and left foot. The emergency court convicted them of banditry and possession of unlicensed weapons.   Under the state of emergency, emergency courts are authorized to deal summarily with crimes such as armed robbery, murder, and smuggling of weapons. One civil judge and two military judges head these courts. The accused are not allowed legal representation. They are allowed only a week to appeal to the district chief justice. In May 2001, these courts reportedly started to function in Southern and Northern Darfur states, where the six men described herein were convicted and sentenced. The lack of legal representation for the accused, the summary nature of the proceedings, and the limited right of appeal (here only to the district judge in Darfur) directly contravene international commitments that Sudan has adopted under the ICCPR.   Human Rights Watch urges you to ensure that these cruel and inhuman sentences are not carried out. Human Rights Watch also urges you to ensure that the courts operate in accordance with international human rights law, particularly the ICCPR.   Sincerely,  Peter Takirambudde  Executive Director  Africa Division LaShawn R.

Human Rights Watch has sent a letter to Sudan's president condemning these punishments and strongly urging that the sentences not be carried out. In recent months, a pregnant southern Sudanese woman, Abok Alfau Akok, was sentenced to death by stoning for adultery, and at least six men have been sentenced to limb amputation for theft.  Human Rights Watch expressed particular concern about Sudan’s so-called “emergency courts,” where the amputation sentences have been issued. These emergency tribunals were established in 2001 under the state of emergency to deal summarily with crimes such as armed robbery, murder, and smuggling of weapons. Human Rights Watch said the tribunals do not meet basic fair trial standards, as they restrict legal representation and appeals.  “These recent sentences from the Sudan judicial system are nothing short of inhumane,” said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch. “Imposing the death penalty in Arabic on this young woman who does not understand Arabic well constitutes a denial of her most fundamental human rights, and the amputation of hands and feet is a brutal punishment that disables permanently.”  More background on these cases follows:  Stoning Sentence On December 8, 2001, a criminal court in Nyala, southern Darfur, sentenced to death by stoning eighteen-year-old Abok Alfau Akok, a Christian woman from the Dinka tribe, after finding her guilty of adultery. Ms. Akok was pregnant at the time of her conviction. She did not have legal representation during the trial. The trial was conducted in Arabic, which is not her language, and there was no translation of the proceedings to ensure that she understood fully the case against her. The man with whom she allegedly had sex was not tried, because the court lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him. The case is now on appeal.  Article 6 (5) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Sudan ratified in March 1986, strictly prohibits the imposition of capital punishment on a pregnant woman.  Human Rights Watch called upon the Sudanese government to protect Ms. Akok from the arbitrary and unacceptable punishment against her. “The fact that only the woman has been tried for the crime of adultery particularly suggests discriminatory application of this harsh law,” said Rone.  Amputations Since December 2001 at least six men in the states of Northern and Southern Darfur have been sentenced to limb amputations for crimes such as robbery and possession of weapons.  Background details on these cases:  On December 12, 2001, an emergency tribunal in Nyala, Southern Darfur convicted Abdu Ismail Tong and Yousif Yaow Mombai of stealing three million Sudanese pounds (approximately U.S. $1160). They confessed while in police custody, but later denied the crime, raising serious concern about the possibility of confession under duress. They were not allowed to be represented by advocates during their trial, and the court sentenced them to amputation of the right hand. On December 25, 2001, an emergency tribunal in Alfahir City in Darfur sentenced Mohamed Adam Yahya and Ahmed Suleiman Mohamed to amputation of the right hand followed by death by hanging. They were convicted of armed robbery. On December 27, 2001, Adam Ibrahim Osman and Abd Allaha Ismail Ibrahim from the town of Um Kadada were sentenced to cross amputation, i.e., amputation of the right hand and left foot. The emergency court convicted them of banditry and possession of unlicensed weapons. All of these sentences were issued by emergency courts composed of one civil judge and two military judges. The accused are not allowed legal representation and are allowed only a week to appeal to the district chief justice. In May 2001, these courts reportedly started to function in Southern and Northern Darfur states, where the six men described above were convicted and sentenced.  Human Rights Watch said the lack of legal representation for the accused, the summary nature of the proceedings, and the limited right of appeal (here only to the district judge in Darfur) directly contravenes international commitments that Sudan has adopted under the ICCPR.  “The emergency courts handing out these drastic penalties do not allow the accused to have a lawyer or advocate, even though so much is at stake,” said Rone. “Limb amputation mutilates the convicted person, and disables from most gainful employment.”  Human Rights Watch urged President Bashir to ensure that these cruel and inhuman sentences are not carried out and called on the Sudanese government to monitor all courts in Sudan to ensure accordance with international human rights law and the rule of law.","Africa, Sudan","Women's Rights"

On January 30, a Tashkent court sentenced each of the officers to 20 years of imprisonment.   """"Finally, police in Uzbekistan have been held accountable for a case of torture and death in detention,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"It's a good first step. But there are many other police and security officers in Uzbekistan whose actions need the same kind of scrutiny.""""  The victim in Wednesday's decision, 32-year old Ravshan Haitov, died from torture just hours after police took him into custody on October 17, 2001 for alleged membership in the banned Muslim group, Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation). Authorities returned his bruised and battered corpse to his family the next day. The official cause of death was then given as a heart attack.  Ravshan Haitov's younger brother, Rasul, testified in court about how the officers had detained and tortured him as well. Rasul Haitov, 25, was hospitalized and placed in intensive care after being beaten by the policemen, and still faces charges based on his religious affiliation.  """"President Karimov should use Wednesday's court ruling as an opportunity to articulate a new policy of bringing torturers to justice,"""" said Andersen. """"He should deliver the message to law enforcement-and the entire country-that torture and extrajudicial execution are impermissible and will be punished.""""  In a December 2000 report on torture in Uzbekistan, """"AND IT WAS HELL ALL OVER AGAIN..."""": TORTURE IN UZBEKISTAN, Human Rights Watch called on the Uzbek government to institute judicial review of detentions, or habeas corpus, in order to protect detainees during their first days in custody, when they are in gravest danger of police abuse. It also called for all detainees to have unimpeded access to attorneys during the investigation and trial periods, and for courts to reject coerced testimony.  """"Had he been brought before a judge and given access to a lawyer, Ravshan Haitov's life might have been saved,"""" said Andersen.  Observers at the trial told Human Rights Watch that although the prosecutor called for two of the policemen to be found guilty of murder, the judge instead convicted all four of """"inflicting bodily harm that caused death,"""" article 104 of the Uzbek Criminal Code. People sentenced under article 104 qualified for release under a presidential amnesty declared in August 2001. The application of article 104 in the Haitov case raised concern that the officers might qualify for amnesty in the near future.  Local rights groups in Uzbekistan similarly welcomed Tuesday's conviction, but expressed anger that no action had been taken on other apparent cases in which police tortured detainees to death. In particular, the authorities have failed to bring to justice those responsible for the deaths in detention of poet Emin Usmon in February 2001 and human rights defender Shovruk Ruzimuradov, five months later. Both men appeared to have died as a result of torture.  """"Torture is a systemic problem in Uzbekistan,"""" said Andersen. """"It should not take a death in custody to stir Uzbek courts to action.""""  Human Rights Watch's December 2000 report on torture in Uzbekistan documented seven deaths in custody as a result of torture. The report, based on more than four years of research, detailed the routine use of electric shock, beatings, asphyxiation, rape and other forms of sexual violence, and sleep deprivation to compel detainees to give self-incriminating statements. The group also found that police used torture as a form of punishment, especially against religious detainees.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Laurien Ntezimana worked for reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi before and after the genocide that killed at least half a million Tutsi in 1994. Didace Muremangingo, a young survivor of the genocide, more recently joined Ntezimana in publishing a local journal called Ubuntu.  Arrested by police, the two were then transferred to the Butare central prison. Local judicial authorities say warrants were issued for their arrest on a matter related to their journal but refused to explain further.  Ubuntu has used the term ubuyanja, a term meaning rebirth of strength or energy, in some of its articles. Ntezimana has reportedly been questioned by authorities about the use of this term in the past. The term appears in the name of a political party which former Rwandan president Pasteur Bizimungu attempted to organize in June 2001. Rwandan authorities immediately declared the party illegal. In December 2001 one of the organizers of the party was murdered in mid-day in Kigali. No one has been arrested for the crime. Bizimungu and others associated with the party have been detained and interrogated by the authorities several times in the last few months; and Bizimungu and one of his associates were attacked by street gangs in August 2001.  “If all these men have done is publish a word that authorities don’t like, they should be freed immediately,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “To do otherwise violates the freedom of expression that the Rwandan government has vowed to protect and suggests a troubling move towards political repression.”","Africa, Rwanda","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Australia's Prime Minister, John Howard, is currently in New York to attend the World Economic Forum. In the letter sent to Philip Ruddock, Australia's Minister for Immigration and Cultural Affairs, Human Rights Watch called for the government to stop detaining unaccompanied children seeking asylum in Australia. Human Rights Watch also requested more information about the reportedly harsh conditions under which the children are kept and their access to refugee status determination procedures.  To protest their confinement -- in some cases for as long as two years -- some Afghan children and adults are threatening to commit suicide and participating in hunger strikes by sewing their mouths closed. In response, the government has placed a few of these children in foster homes.  """"Placing a handful of unaccompanied children seeking asylum in foster care is a good gesture, but hundreds more are still in remote desert detention centers that lack ventilation and basic facilities,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"All of these children should be immediately released from detention and adequately cared for.""""  In the Woomera detention center, the site of the largest protest, the government is holding 331 children, fifty-eight of whom are not with their parents and are not being cared for by an adult. These children are particularly vulnerable and need special protection. The detention center reportedly mixes children with unrelated adults, and there are reports of adults sexually assaulting children.  The 1990 Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Australia on December 17, 1990, requires Australia to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to all children seeking refuge, with the child's best interests as a primary consideration.  According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, detention should be used """"only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time.""""

At a meeting in the Nigerian capital, Abuja, Zimbabwe agreed to end illegal occupations of farms, promoted by the government since February 2000, and respect the rule of law. In return, the United Kingdom and other """"international partners"""" pledged to support the land reform process. Written into the agreement were a number of commitments that the Zimbabwe delegation, headed by Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge, made to the meeting. These included: no new farm occupations; removal of occupiers of farms that were not listed for resettlement; restoration of the rule of law to the land reform programme; respect for freedom of expression; and firm action against violence and intimidation. This report looks at a number of the explicit commitments made by the Zimbabwe government at Abuja and reviews how these have been respected in practice. Almost immediately after it had signed the agreement, there were indications that the government was retreating from the promises made. In the following months, it has become yet clearer that the government's commitment to the agreement was only on paper. Human Rights Watch is preparing a separate report on the issues surrounding land reform. This memorandum focuses on more general concerns about respect for the rule of law. In particular Human Rights Watch concludes the following: Freedom of expression Freedom of expression has been under assault both through legal restrictions and constant harassment and violence. A new bill gives the government the power to determine who may practice as a journalist and prohibits foreign news organizations from employing whom they choose. Although the bill has been rejected by the parliamentary committees responsible for both media and legal affairs, the government apparently remains determined to have it enacted before the forthcoming presidential elections. Despite the passage of a law earlier in 2001 legalizing private broadcasting, no broadcasting licences have been issued. The government retains a tight control over the publicly-funded Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation. The privately-owned Daily News-the only independent daily newspaper-has been the target of a constant campaign of harassment by the frivolous application of criminal charges. The police have made no progress in investigating bombings of the newspaper's premises in April 2000 and January 2001. Journalists and newspaper vendors are subject to constant harassment, threats, and violence by the police and by government sponsored militia (often led by veterans of the liberation war and thus often known as war veterans). Supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change are victims of violence and exclusion from their jobs for the expression of their political views. Acts of violence against opposition supporters are carried out with total impunity by supporters of the ruling party. Rule of Law Government, state agencies such as the police, and supporters of the ruling party all display a disregard for the constitution, statute law, and the decisions of the courts. New legislation-enacted by decree-on the land issue purports to legalize unlawful land occupations dating back to May 2000. This is intended to bypass unfavorable Supreme Court rulings. Judges have resigned after violent threats-and no offer of protection from the authorities. A Supreme Court that is now balanced in the government's favor revisits previous judgments in order to reverse them. New legislation on public order and security was passed on January 10 and will drastically infringe several constitutional rights, including freedom of assembly, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement. Violence Thousands of Zimbabweans, almost all of them presumed supporters of the opposition, farmers and farm workers, have been the victims of political and land-related violence since the Abuja agreement. There has been no perceptible effort on the government's part to restrain its supporters from violence. In a number of documented instances since the Abuja agreement, notably in mid-November in Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayo, the police have escorted and protected supporters of the ruling party engaging in criminal acts of violence. In conclusion, not only have the terms of the Abuja agreement not been respected: official disrespect for the rule of law and constitutionally guaranteed right has, if anything, increased during the past four months.","Africa, Zimbabwe","Free Speech"

In its submission to the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, meeting in London on January 30, Human Rights Watch said that the government of President Robert Mugabe had intimidated opponents, imposed legal restrictions on them, and engaged in extensive political violence.  Unless the Zimbabwe government immediately fulfilled a set of minimum conditions it should face the threat of suspension from the international organization at the next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, due in March.  “Respect for human rights in Zimbabwe has deteriorated rapidly over the last two years,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “The Commonwealth should insist that President Mugabe take immediate steps to end political violence and restore the rule of law.”  In the last few weeks, parliament in Zimbabwe has passed or introduced new legislation that will drastically infringe several constitutional rights, including freedom of assembly, freedom of expression and of the media, and freedom of movement.

At its January 30 meeting, the CMAG will consider whether formally to place Zimbabwe on its agenda—that is, to review its compliance with the fundamental standards, principles and values of the organization.  Human Rights Watch believes that Zimbabwe should be placed on the CMAG agenda and that the government should be given a series of clearly specified conditions that it must immediately fulfill. These conditions include:  Withdrawal or repeal of legislation in violation of constitutional rights and restrictive of political activity; Clear public instructions to the police and other law enforcement agencies that perpetrators of public violence should be dealt with, with the full force of the law; Prompt disciplinary and judicial measures against police and other law enforcement officers who fail to adhere to these instructions. The immediate cessation of violence, accompanied by these minimum steps, would begin to re-establish an environment in which political debate can take place freely, Human Rights Watch said.","Africa, Zimbabwe",""

In a point by point response to recent statements by the Bush administration regarding the Geneva Conventions, Human Rights Watch explained U.S. obligations to use competent tribunals where the prisoner of war status of detained belligerents was in doubt; that the Geneva Conventions do not prohibit the questioning of detainees, including POWs; and that POWs convicted of crimes can be detained even after the armed conflict ends.  """"The U.S. government cannot choose to wage war in Afghanistan with guns, bombs and soldiers and then assert the laws of war do not apply,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"To say that the Geneva Conventions do not apply to a war on terrorism is particularly dangerous, as it is all too easy to imagine this 'exception' coming back to haunt U.S. forces in future conflicts.""""  The Geneva Conventions presume that a captured combatant is a prisoner of war, unless a competent tribunal determines otherwise on a case by case basis. While members of al-Qaeda would probably not meet the Geneva Conventions' requirements for POW status, members of the Taliban's armed forces mostly likely would. For the purposes of determining POW status, U.S. recognition of the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan is irrelevant-despite assertions to the contrary by some Adminstration officials.  Human Rights Watch also disputed assertions that the U.S. need for """"flexibility"""" in interrogating the detainees precludes granting POW status. """"Some U.S. officials apparently believe that ignoring the clear mandate of the Geneva Conventions will preserve America's ability to interrogate the detainees,"""" said Roth. """"In fact, nothing in the Conventions precludes interrogating POWs for war crimes or other criminal offenses."""" Roth notes that while POWs are not required to answer questions beyond name, rank, serial number and date of birth, the Geneva Conventions do not prevent interrogators from asking questions on other matters. And regardless of whether a detainee has POW status, interrogators cannot use torture or other forms of coercion. But they can use plea bargaining and other incentives to cooperation-and the patient, careful, sophisticated questioning that is always required to obtain information from hostile detainees.  Human Rights Watch also pointed out that the Geneva Conventions do not preclude the trial, conviction and sentencing of POWs. POWs can be charged and tried for war crimes, crimes against humanity or other acts that would be crimes if committed by U.S. soldiers. POW status would only provide protection for the act of taking up arms against opposing military forces. If convicted, POWs would serve their sentences confined under U.S. jurisdiction and would not be entitled to repatriation absent U.S. consent.  """"It would be tragically shortsighted for the U.S. to ignore its obligations under the Geneva Conventions,"""" said Roth.

According to a joint letter written by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the organizations are """"disturbed by certain provisions of the draft Comprehensive Convention.""""

The treatment of Americans never came close to being humane. But, as Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) has said of his POW ordeal: """"I'm certain we would have been a lot worse off if there had not been the Geneva Conventions around."""" That's an important story to remember as Americans debate whether the Geneva Conventions should be upheld in the treatment of prisoners from Afghanistan. It reminds us that the issue is not about whether we sympathize with accused terrorists who probably don't want our sympathy anyway. It is about protecting a set of rules that protect all people, including American servicemen and women taken captive in war. It is about preserving America's right to complain when Americans are mistreated overseas. To his credit, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld acknowledged last week that the conventions do apply to all of the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, reversing earlier statements to the contrary. What do the conventions tell us about how these prisoners should be treated? The al-Qaeda detainees probably are not entitled to formal POW status because they did not fight for a regular army, wear insignia that identified them as soldiers, or respect the rules of war. If so, they could be tried for war crimes or terrorist acts in the President's proposed military commissions, as long as the trials respect due process. But the Taliban detainees probably should be called POWs. They fought for the regular armed forces of Afghanistan. Rumsfeld has suggested that this rule may not apply to the Taliban because they weren't internationally recognized as the government of Afghanistan. But the Geneva Conventions don't make that distinction. Nor has the United States: In the Korean War, for example, neither the United States nor the United Nations recognized the communist government of China, but U.S. forces treated Chinese prisoners as POWs. If any of the detainees are POWs, the Geneva Conventions oblige them to give only their name, rank and serial number. But that doesn't mean the military can't interrogate them about other things, including possible future attacks. And the United States can still prosecute them for war crimes in a military court martial. Who determines whether they are POWs or """"unlawful combatants,"""" as the Defense Department has called them? Rumsfeld cannot make that call himself. When there is any doubt about a prisoner's status, the conventions require that they be considered POWs until a """"competent tribunal"""" decides otherwise, and so do U.S. military regulations. The Defense Department should respect its own rules by convening such tribunals without delay. Whatever the prisoners' legal status, the Geneva Conventions entitle them to be treated humanely. In many respects, the military has taken this responsibility very seriously, while taking understandable steps to protect itself from dangerous prisoners. The main problem has been the confinement of prisoners in metal cages open to the elements - conditions Americans would surely condemn if American prisoners were subjected to them overseas. For all the debate on this issue, the Defense Department has essentially acknowledged the conditions are inadequate by pointing out that the shelters are temporary, and promising to build permanent facilities. That effort needs to be accelerated. There is an easy way for the administration to settle the debate. The Red Cross is now inspecting the facilities in Guantanamo and will be making its recommendations privately to the Defense Department. Rumsfeld should release those recommendations, and he should pledge now to follow them. If the administration does that, it will clear up much of the controversy and confusion. It will be showing that nations can bring terrorists to justice without sinking to their level. And it will ensure that the next time American servicemen and women are imprisoned overseas, the Geneva Conventions will still be there to protect them.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial"

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to facilitate repatriation of indigenous Montagnard refugees who have fled from Vietnam to Cambodia during the past year. A report of the January 21 meeting in Phnom Penh, signed by all three parties, makes no mention of the fact that any return of refugees to Vietnam must be voluntary and that the right of individuals to continue to seek asylum in Cambodia must be respected. In addition, while Vietnam has now agreed to allow UNHCR to visit its Central Highlands to monitor conditions for return, access appears to be very limited and the Vietnamese authorities must approve each U.N. visit.  """"We are concerned that this agreement may send a green light to both the Cambodian and Vietnamese authorities that it is now acceptable to forcibly expel Montagnards seeking asylum in Cambodia,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"There should be no action on repatriation unless there are firm guarantees that any such returns are completely voluntary.""""  The two human rights organizations called for any repatriation to be completely voluntary and for UNHCR to have full and unhindered access to the highlands both before and after any repatriation, in order to assure the safety of returnees.  Since March 2001, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented abuse, imprisonment and beating of dozens of Montagnards deported from Cambodia. One man who returned voluntarily to Vietnam in September 2001, was reportedly interrogated and detained in the provincial prison for a week before being placed under heavy surveillance in his home village.  """"There do not appear to be sufficient safeguards to protect the returnees and their families,"""" said Lars Olsson, Refugee Officer for Amnesty International. """"Permission to visit the Central Highlands of Vietnam for UNHCR is not enough - UNHCR must have freedom of movement there, and must fully assess conditions in the area and monitor the safety of any returnees.""""  The two rights organizations also expressed concern that new Montagnard arrivals in Cambodia may be denied their basic rights to seek asylum. Cambodia is a state party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and has obligations under that Convention to protect the rights of all who seek asylum within its borders.  """"There will be people from the Central Highlands of Viet Nam for whom going home is not an option. Their right to seek and enjoy asylum, and to have a durable solution to their plight, must be protected,"""" said Lars Olsson.  Both organizations called on the Vietnamese and Cambodian governments to continue negotiations with the UNHCR to resolve the plight of the Montagnard refugees, keeping in mind UNHCR's mandate at all times to ensure that any repatriations are voluntary, safe and dignified. Alternative solutions must be available to those for whom repatriation to their homeland is not a safe option.  Montagnard people from Vietnam began crossing the border to Cambodia in early 2001, following unrest in the Central Highlands in February. An initial group of refugees were resettled in the U.S., while others have been housed in two sites in Cambodia, with aid provided by UNHCR. There have been several recorded incidents of forced return of refugees to Vietnam by the Cambodian authorities, most recently in December 2001, when more than 160 people were forced back across the border.  In July 2001, talks between UNHCR and the two governments broke down when the Vietnamese authorities refused to allow access for the refugee agency to the Central Highlands. While this has now apparently been resolved, the access appears to be limited and the Vietnamese authorities must approve visits.  The Vietnamese government maintains that the Montagnard refugees are """"illegal migrants"""" who have left the country without permission. Independent human rights monitors, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, are officially denied access to Vietnam.","Asia, Cambodia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Human Rights Watch also said President Bush should stress the need for a broad-based government that fully respects the human rights of all Afghans.  """"After decades of civil war, the people of Afghanistan need a government that is committed to protecting the rights of everyone - including women and ethnic minorities,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"President Bush should offer more U.S. assistance to ensure that the necessary political and judicial structures are in place, and that human rights are central to the reconstruction effort.""""  At the international conference on Afghanistan's reconstruction recently held in Tokyo, the U.S. committed $296 million in assistance this year. Bilateral and multilateral donors, including the European Union, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and the World Bank, pledged a cumulative total of $4.5 billion in aid in 2002. Human Rights Watch urged the administration to join members of Congress who are calling for a much larger U.S. contribution.  In Tokyo, Mr. Karzai said he spoke """"as a citizen of a country that has had nothing but disaster, war, brutality and deprivation"""" for many years. His administration pledged to build a representative government, repatriate refugees and the internally displaced, clear landmines, and restore and protect the rights of Afghan women.  """"It will take years to rebuild the country. But at the same time, steps must be taken now to lower the risks of renewed conflict along sectarian or ethnic lines,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Local and national institutions must be created to guarantee the rights of all Afghan citizens so they feel they have a stake in the future and their interests will be protected.""""  Human Rights Watch urged President Bush to use the occasion of Mr. Karzai's visit to express concern about press reports of looting and other abuses against Pashtun civilians in the northern provinces of Balkh and Faryab, where they form a local minority.  """"Without adequate security, there is no chance for reconstruction to take place, for refugees or displaced persons to return, or for humanitarian aid workers to give the kind of assistance that is now urgently needed. Women feel particularly vulnerable,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Human Rights Watch urged Bush to make the following commitments in his meetings with Mr. Karzai:  Funding and technical assistance for the rebuilding of Afghanistan's legal and judicial system, including reform of the rural legal system, construction of new courts, prisons and jails, the drafting of a new constitution, and the recruitment of women Afghan judges and lawyers from within the country and from the diaspora. Support for the establishment of a domestic human rights commission, provided for in the Bonn agreement, which can play a crucial role in monitoring, education, and training of Afghan police and security personnel. Assistance with reconstruction programs aimed at reintegrating Afghan refugees and those displaced by the war, with special attention to the needs of women and the disabled. President Bush should stress the U.S. commitment to working with the interim Afghanistan administration, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, and governments in the region to ensure that refugees are not forced back against their will. No repatriation program should begin without mechanisms in place to identify those who are unwilling or unable to go home and who continue to need international protection. President Bush should affirm and expand aid for millions of Afghan refugees now in neighboring countries Strong backing for the key role of women in the country's reconstruction. President Bush should offer assistance with educational, employment and health programs for Afghan girls and women, while affirming U.S. support for the full participation of women in the political process and reform of the Afghan legal system. Women leaders at the local level are already playing a critical role, disseminating information through women's rights NGOs. It is essential that Afghan women be appointed to senior positions in the new government. Assistance in the clearing of landmines and unexploded ordinance that threaten to maim and kill Afghan civilians. Here the U.S. has a special responsibility. Since last October, thousands of missiles and bombs have been launched or dropped by U.S. and British forces, many of which failed to detonate. Even before the U.S. attacks began, Afghanistan was littered with landmines. The U.S. should make an emergency commitment of funds and technical assistance for mine clearance, public awareness programs, and new training programs for clearance personnel, including how to deal with cluster bombs.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""

Recent press reports allege that children are being detained with adults for up to two years in desert detention centers that are unclean, extremely hot, and lack ventilation or adequate outdoor recreation space. There are also reports that adults have sexually assaulted detained children.  If the above reports are true, Australia's practices are illegal under international law. The Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified by Australia on December 17, 1990, requires Australia to provide protection and humanitarian assistance to all children seeking refugee status, with the best interests of the child as a primary consideration.

On January 27, President Islam Karimov of Uzbekistan will hold a referendum to amend the constitution to extend his term of office to 2007. Conditions for the vote fall below basic international standards. The Karimov government allows no free press or independent political opposition to operate in the country.  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the United States government have declined to send observers to Uzbekistan for the referendum. The U.S. cited concerns that the vote """"will not be consistent with international standards.""""  While the U.S. has criticized the referendum, it continues to develop close ties with the Karimov government. Top-level Pentagon, State Department and Treasury officials are scheduled to arrive in Uzbekistan on the very day of the referendum to meet with President Karimov and hammer out a series of deals on military and economic assistance. The meetings are the first of the newly formed U.S.-Uzbek Joint Security Cooperation Consultations, which are designed to assess bilateral relations on an annual basis.  President Karimov is also expected to visit the U.S. in the coming months.  """"The timing of this referendum is no coincidence,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch, """"Karimov is testing the international community to see what he can get away with now that he's viewed as a critical partner in the war. He probably believes that he's traded a military base and a bridge for a free ride on democracy and human rights issues.""""  Uzbekistan has given basing rights to U.S. forces, and, after much international pressure, opened a bridge for relief supplies going into Afghanistan.  Karimov, who came to power as Communist Party First Secretary in Soviet Uzbekistan in 1989, was named President of that Soviet satellite in 1990. Karimov then declared victory following a seriously marred election in 1991, when he became President of the independent Republic of Uzbekistan.  Karimov was re-elected for a would-be final five-year term in 2000. The OSCE declined to send observers to that presidential vote after determining that the election environment allowed no possibility for a genuine contest. U.S. officials announced that the election """"was neither free nor fair and offered Uzbekistan's voters no true choice."""" The State Department also noted that the only candidate ostensibly running against Karimov announced that he himself had voted for the incumbent president.  """"It's only been two years since the embarrassingly illegitimate presidential election, so calling a referendum now looks like a blatant grab for power,"""" said Andersen.  Political participation is out of the reach of average citizens in Uzbekistan, where there are no genuine opposition political parties and no independent news media.  President Karimov has extended his term in office through use of a referendum once before, in 1995. Uzbekistan's constitution provides for term limits of two five-year terms. The January 27 referendum is designed to amend the constitution to allow for seven-year presidential terms.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

In 1999, Human Rights Watch charged in a 166-page report, """"The Enron Corporation: Corporate Complicity in Human Rights Violations,"""" that Enron subsidiaries paid local law enforcement to suppress opposition to its power plant south of Bombay.  """"Enron is now being widely accused of arrogance and lack of transparency, but the people of Dabhol have known that all along,"""" said Arvind Ganesan, director of the Business and Human Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. """"Enron was complicit in human rights abuse in India for several years.""""  Local opposition to the Enron project began in 1992 over concerns about corruption and the hasty negotiations over the terms of Enron's investment. Farmers complained that the power plant had unfairly acquired their land and had diverted scarce water for its needs. Local activists raised concerns over potential environmental damage.  The U.S. government bears special responsibility for the human rights consequences of Enron's investment because of its aggressive lobbying on behalf of the three U.S.-based companies developing the project, Ganesan said. Although the Indian press widely reported the human rights troubles around the power plant, U.S. officials failed to investigate the matter.  The World Bank repeatedly refused to finance the project because it was """"not economically viable,"""" but the U.S. government extended between $290 million and $300 million in loan guarantees to Enron for its investment in Dabhol.  The Export-Import Bank requires an analysis of the human rights implications of its loans. But the State Department's entire human rights assessment for one Export-Import Bank loan for the Dabhol project read, """"The State Department has no objection to this case on political grounds or on the basis of human rights issues.""""  """"U.S. taxpayers funded corporate complicity in human rights abuse,"""" said Ganesan. """"Congress should make sure that never happens again."""" Ganesan urged the U.S. Congress to establish a human rights assessment office at the U.S. Export-Import Bank to report to Congress.  A provision was introduced in the U.S. Congress during 2001 to strengthen the Export-Import Bank's human rights oversight. But the Bush Administration, the head of the Export-Import Bank itself, and many members of the U.S. business community opposed the provision, which was """"killed"""" by a committee of the House of Representatives in November 2001.  The 1999 Human Rights Watch report documents how contractors for the Dabhol Power Corporation harassed and attacked individuals opposed to the power plant. Police refused to investigate complaints, and in several cases, actually arrested the victims on trumped-up charges. The Dabhol Power Corporation, under provisions of law, reimbursed the abusive state forces for the security they provided to the company. These forces, located adjacent to the project site, were stationed there largely for the purpose of dealing with protests. While they reported to local police, their expenses were paid by the company, a subsidiary of Enron.  In one instance in June 1997, Maharashtra police raided a fishing village where many residents opposed the power plant. They arbitrarily beat and arrested dozens of villagers, including Sadhana Bhalekar, the wife of a well-known protester against the plant. They broke down the door and window of Bhalekar's bathroom and dragged her naked out into the street, beating her with batons. Bhalekar was three months pregnant at the time. In another instance in May 1997, police beat and arrested nearly 180 protesters who were demonstrating peacefully outside the company gates. The protests had largely ended by 1998.  Since the project's inception in 1992, Enron and the government of Maharashtra state, where the power plant is located, repeatedly ignored public complaints. """"Dabhol Power Corporation would not tolerate any human rights abuses by its employees and sub-contractors,"""" the company said in a 1997 statement. """"If you have concerns about police actions, we suggest that you take it up with the police or government body that is responsible for their operations."""" In 2000, Enron began to take steps to address future violations, but those efforts ended when the company collapsed.  Because of the plant's high cost of power, the Maharashtra state government announced in June 2001 that it was terminating its agreement with the Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC). Shortly after, DPC ceased operations and insisted that the government repay its debts. The dispute continued, but was further complicated when Enron declared bankruptcy on December 2, 2001. On January 17, 2002, Enron reportedly filed an approximately $200 million claim with the U.S. government's Overseas Private Investment Corporation in an attempt to recoup losses from the Dabhol Power Corporation. The project is up for sale to other investors.","Asia, India","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Bush  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW  Washington, D.C. 20500    Dear President Bush:   In your New Year’s Day address to the nation, you proudly described America as a “land of justice, liberty, and tolerance.” Yet in the U.S. military, men and women who have served their country with courage, skill, and distinction are discharged every day simply because of their sexual orientation. For many minority groups, the U.S. military has helped to break down walls of prejudice; yet for gay men and lesbians, those barriers of intolerance remain. We ask you to take the necessary steps to end military rules that discriminate against gay and lesbian servicemembers.    In the attached report, Uniform Discrimination: The ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell’ Policy of the U.S. Military, Human Rights Watch details the history, nature, and impact of the military’s current policy toward gays and lesbians. We conclude that the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is based on outdated prejudices, violates fundamental human rights, and has not been shown to further the U.S. military’s effectiveness. Indeed, the policy is counterproductive: it denies the country the service of skilled, trained, and dedicated servicemembers.  As you know, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy, enacted into law in 1993, permits gays and lesbians to serve in the military only on the condition that they are silent and celibate. If they acknowledge their sexual orientation by word or deed, or if they are investigated and found to be homosexual, they are discharged, regardless of their military skills or record of service. No such rules apply to heterosexuals.  Supporters of “don’t ask, don’t tell” argue that permitting acknowledged gays or lesbians to serve in the military would impair unit cohesiveness and hence military effectiveness. There is no evidence to support that argument. Over the last decade, a number of U.S. allies, including the United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and Israel, have changed exclusionary policies and accepted openly gay men and women into their armed forces without impairing military effectiveness. Today, most NATO countries permit gays to serve on the same terms as heterosexuals.    During the Gulf War in 1991, President George H.W. Bush suspended discharges under the regulations then in place that prohibited gays from serving, thereby acknowledging that the armed forces needed the contributions of all Americans who wished to serve their country in a time of need. We are aware of no evidence that the military campaign in the Gulf was in any way compromised by the presence of gay and lesbian servicemembers. Indeed, supporters of “don’t ask, don’t tell” have not been able to point to any empirical evidence of unit disintegration or bad morale in the U.S. military units where acknowledged gays or lesbians have served. It is noteworthy that, according to one recent survey, 39 percent of Navy sailors personally know a servicemember who is homosexual.    As President, you have inherited a legacy of prejudice similar to that faced by President Truman in 1948. Supporters of racially segregated military units insisted that racial integration would destroy unit cohesion. No such thing happened, however, when President Truman disavowed that prejudice and ordered unit integration in 1948. That act of leadership led to the integrated military that serves America with such distinction today. There is no reason to believe that the U.S. military would achieve any lesser professionalism if policies that discriminate against gays and lesbians were ended today.    The “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is predicated on heterosexual prejudice, fears, and stereotypes toward gays and lesbians. Yet there has been a sea-change in American public attitudes towards homosexuality since the policy was created. Laws criminalizing sodomy have been struck down or legislatively repealed; laws and regulations guaranteeing employment rights for gays have been enacted; public attitudes toward gays have been increasingly tolerant; and public opinion polls show majority support for permitting gays to serve openly in the military. Today, the “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy is the only law in the United States that requires the dismissal of someone simply for acknowledging his or her homosexuality.    Military life, understandably, is governed by rules and strictures necessary to the military mission that would have no place in civilian life. However, rules that pander to prejudice are not necessary to the military mission. Codes of conduct that apply to all servicemembers, without regard to sexual orientation, could address any individual problems that might arise from ending discriminatory policies against gays and lesbians.    We urge you to exercise leadership on this matter of basic fairness and justice. The United States has a history of progressively repudiating prejudice and discrimination against groups of people. We ask you to lead the country further along this path, by rejecting military policies that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.    Sincerely,    /s/    Kenneth Roth  Executive Director     Cc: Hon.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/01/20/building-brighter-future-afghans","Building a Brighter Future for Afghans","Building a Brighter Future for Afghans","","01/20/2002","WASHINGTON -- The rebuilding of a peaceful Afghanistan requires a commitment to protecting the human rights of all Afghan citizens, including women and ethnic minorities. The International Conference on Reconstruction Assistance to Afghanistan taking place in Tokyo should take action to support the institutions and programs needed to promote human rights and secure justice. Japan has made valuable contributions to helping Afghanistan's war-ravaged population. Tokyo has given equipment and funds to remove land mines, provided assistance to refugees in camps in Pakistan and given humanitarian aid through Japanese nongovernmental organizations. As the host and cochair of the conference this week, the government of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi should now use its influence to ensure that human rights are integrated into the broader reconstruction agenda. The Bonn agreement adopted Dec. 5 emphasized the central role of human rights in Afghanistan's future, as did a subsequent U.N. General Assembly resolution. The U.N. declared that """"only a political settlement aimed at the establishment of a broad-based, gender-sensitive, multiethnic and fully representative government, which respects the human rights of all Afghans . . . can lead to durable peace and reconciliation."""" But there's a risk that these concerns will be sidelined as the donors scramble to underwrite the new Afghan interim administration and quickly start up urgently needed aid projects. That would be a mistake. Without a functioning judiciary, and measures aimed at empowering Afghan women and supporting returning refugees, the new Afghanistan administration will face serious difficulties. A key priority for the Tokyo conference should be a decision to supply the funding needed for the human rights components of the U.N. mission charged with supporting and coordinating the various aid efforts. Human rights shouldn't be an afterthought or an agenda item left for future aid conferences. Afghanistan's legal system must be rebuilt --literally from the ground up. Courts, jails, and prisons must be reconstructed. In the early 1970s, there were legal codes, a system of district courts, and a law faculty at Kabul University. Resources will be needed for the recruitment and training of jurists, prosecutors, defense attorneys, police officers, and court officials. Special attention must be paid to recruiting Afghan women judges and lawyers. (The women's affairs ministry is in dire needs of funds; these should be specifically earmarked.) As power shifts take place and as refugees and displaced persons return to their home villages, disputes over land and water resources are likely to increase. Impartial arbitration mechanisms will be vital to address competing claims and to prevent renewed conflict along ethnic or sectarian lines. In addition, village justice systems have traditionally not been able to fairly address crimes against women. Donors should provide funding to reform the rural legal system. The Bonn agreement called for the creation of an independent human rights commission by the new Afghan government. Clearly such a commission could play a useful role carrying out training, educational and monitoring activities. The agreement also affirmed the role of the U.N. in investigating past crimes and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The U.N. mission should be adequately funded to assist with both of these initiatives. Donors should earmark contributions for the new human rights commission, and for teams to work with Afghan civil society and the new government in drafting laws and a constitution. A second priority topic for the Tokyo conference is the plight of millions of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, Iran and other neighboring countries. No one should be forced to return to Afghanistan, and voluntary repatriation should take place only with effective international monitoring and screening mechanisms in place, developed in cooperation with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Conditions remain dangerous and unstable in many areas. But when refugees and displaced civilians do go home, they'll confront wrecked communities and problems resuming farming and getting adequate shelter for their families. Repatriation projects must be crafted with a special focus on the needs of women, illiterate and disabled returnees. Meanwhile, the Tokyo conference should encourage donors to maintain the assistance needed for refugees to remain safely in camps outside Afghanistan, protected from violence or any pressure to go back prematurely. Finally, the donors should agree on an immediate infusion of funds for the emergency clearing of mines in areas where aid must be delivered. Quick funds are also needed for civilian mine awareness programs, and new training schemes for those doing the clearing. In addition to millions of land mines, the Afghan landscape is cluttered with unexploded American cluster bombs and other ordinance. Making the country safe from the litter of decades of war is a long-term objective, but the new Afghan government could show its determination to end the threat by deciding to accede to the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. The Tokyo conference marks a new beginning for the Afghan people, supported by the international community. Building the conditions for peace, and economic and social development requires a commitment to human rights principles -- and the institutions to promote and defend them.

Human Rights Watch called on the government to vigorously investigate and prosecute any persons, including government agents, found to be involved in election-related violence or voter coercion.  """"The violence and intimidation are clearly increasing as election day draws near,"""" said Sara Colm, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"The international community cannot sit idly by."""" The rights organization called on donor countries that support Cambodian development projects to demand concrete action from national and local authorities in promptly investigating violations and punishing those responsible.  The run-up to the official campaign period, which begins January 18, has seen at least 250 reports of intimidation, threats and harassment, almost exclusively directed against candidates and supporters of parties running against the incumbent Cambodian People's Party (CPP), including twenty-one death threats. Fifteen opposition party members and commune council candidates have been killed since the start of 2001, including two women candidates who were shot dead during the first week of January 2002.  Cambodia has not held local elections since the late 1960's, when only candidates from the ruling party could stand for office. The commune-level elections in February have been repeatedly delayed since 1993.  The mechanisms put in place by the government ostensibly to deal with violations have so far been totally inadequate, Human Rights Watch said. The National Election Committee, and its local level sub-commissions, have not once exercised their considerable powers to punish perpetrators of electoral abuses, despite hundreds of reports flooding in to Cambodian rights organizations.

The demonstrations called for an end to """"crimes against humanity"""" committed by Indonesian forces in Aceh. Faisal Saifuddin, head of the Jakarta office of a nongovernmental organization called SIRA (Sentral Informasi Referendum Aceh), was sentenced to one year in prison by the Central Jakarta criminal court.  """"This trial should never have taken place. It represents an assault on the right to free expression, which the Megawati government has pledged to respect,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division.  Faisal Saifuddin was charged with violating articles 154 and 155 of the Criminal Code, known as the """"spreading hatred"""" laws, often used by the Soeharto government against critics and activists. The prosecutor had demanded a two-year sentence.  According to the prosecutor's written summation, the key accusations against Faisal Saifuddin were that on November 9, he led a demonstration in front of the United Nations office in Jakarta, and also participated in a subsequent demonstration on November 13, 2000. At the demonstrations, flyers were distributed, including one dated November 8, signed by Faisal Saifuddin and by Muzakkir M., the Secretary of SIRA-Jakarta. The flyer allegedly accused the """"neo-colonialist government of Indonesia"""" of crimes against humanity and """"suppressing the basic rights and human dignity of the people of Aceh."""" It ended with an appeal to """"the U.N. and the international community to press both the neocolonialist government of Indonesia and GAM [Acehnese rebels] to implement a ceasefire and stop the violence in Aceh.""""  The language in the flyer, excerpted above, appears to have been the government's sole legal rationale for the one-year sentence, which was a clear violation of the internationally recognized right to free expression.  Other SIRA activists have also been targeted in the past year. On November 20, 2000, Muhammad Nazar, the head of SIRA in Aceh, was arrested on charges of """"spreading hatred"""" for having hung banners in favor of a referendum on independence for Aceh and against the military during a campus rally the previous August. He was convicted in March 2001 and given a ten-month sentence; he was released, with time served, last October.","Asia, Indonesia","Free Speech"

The legal system should emphasize the recruitment and training of Afghan women judges and lawyers, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch also called for an infusion of funds for the clearing of landmines.  Refugees in camps outside of Afghanistan are also in urgent need of support and protection.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/01/18/cambodia-commune-elections","Cambodia- Commune Elections","Cambodia: Commune Elections","","01/18/2002","Once again the world's attention is turning to Cambodia as the troubled country gears up for its third election since 1993. This time, it's the turn of ordinary people throughout the countryside to run for office --Feb. 3 will see the first local, or """"commune"""" elections to be held since before the Khmer Rouge took over in 1975, and the first ever that can lay any claim to being democratic. But despite the relative stability of the past two years, a recent trip to the country confirmed that the worst fears of Cambodia-watchers are being realized: Political intimidation, violence and murder are on the rise as polling day draws near. When the U.N. Human Rights Special Representative Peter Leuprecht visited Cambodia in November 2001, Prime Minister Hun Sen responded with a call for nonviolence in the run up to the elections and a pledge to repeat that call 15 times before election day. This week, in the wake of increased election-related violence, he reiterated his call. The prime minister's statements are welcome, but clearly not enough. The political climate looked much better a year ago. After years of delay, in January 2001 the government finally adopted a law to establish commune elections. When Cambodians head to the polls next month they will be voting for new leaders of the country's 1,621 communes (groupings of four to seven villages), who to date have been appointees of the ruling Cambodian People's Party. Cambodian democracy advocates were frustrated that the final version of the election law established an electoral system based not on individual candidacy but on party affiliation and party lists. This, they felt, exacerbated traditional problems of political party patronage and inter-party conflict. Nonetheless, they were pleased that elections were finally in sight. As voter registration got underway in July 2001, there were reports of an intimidation campaign by the CPP, with local party officials allegedly pressuring people to sign loyalty oaths, threatening opposition candidates and trying to buy-off voters. Similar complaints have continued to surface through to the official campaign period. Worse still, reports of violence and threats against opposition candidates started coming in thick and fast, with little evidence of government efforts to identify let alone prosecute the perpetrators. Opposition party signboards were torn down and many activists were told by their local authorities that if they continued to support the opposition their security could not be guaranteed. In November two candidates and an opposition activist were murdered, and in December there were three more killings. Just earlier this month, four opposition members -- two of them female council candidates -- were shot and killed within three days. In total, at least fifteen opposition candidates and activists have now been killed since the start of 2001. Human-rights groups fear the violence and intimidation tactics will intensify once the official election campaign, which kicks off today, is underway. The mechanisms put in place by the government to deal with violations have so far proved woefully inadequate. The National Election Committee and its local level sub-commissions have not once exercised their considerable powers to punish perpetrators of electoral abuses, despite hundreds of reports flooding in. The Central Security Office for the Defense of the Elections has been similarly ineffective, its occasional declarations failing to ensure the safety of opposition candidates and supporters. It's not surprising that Cambodian human-rights activists doubt the sincerity of the government's declarations. Ending political violence and intimidation may not be as easy as closing karaoke bars, as Hun Sen did unilaterally last November, but there's little doubt that should the government genuinely wish for a clean election, it could achieve it --or at least come close. The CPP needs badly to win these elections. After 20 years of controlling the government, the CPP faces the possibility that it may lose the next national elections, scheduled for 2003. This situation would be no more acceptable to the CPP than it was in the U.N.-sponsored elections of 1993, when the royalist Funcinpec party took the lead role in a fragile coalition government -- only for the CPP to seize back near control in the coup of July 1997. The current commune chiefs are political appointees of the ruling party, and many have been in place since the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979. Before candidate registration took place in November 2001, local authorities began surveying the voters to find out which commune chiefs were particularly disliked, and many of these either failed to make the party's candidate lists, or were placed far down the order of preference. The commune elections therefore will be an important test of whether the CPP is able to maintain its influence at the local level, which in turn will affect the strength of its national network. With no sign that the government is yet taking serious steps to end the violence, it is now up to the international community to exert strong pressure. Donor countries that support Cambodian development projects should demand concrete action from national and local authorities in investigating violations and punishing those responsible. The donors should call for access to the broadcast media for all political parties during the campaign period beginning this week, including airing of candidate discussions on national TV and radio. Access to the media, which is dominated by the CPP, is a critical problem for opposition parties. Donors should continue to support the work of independent Cambodian election monitoring organizations and international observers to monitor and report on the election period and any post-election violence and reprisals. The Cambodian government needs to send a strong message to its citizens that this time around, they can vote for the party of their choice without fear, that their choice will be secret and that the final results will accurately reflect the will of the Cambodian people.

The award is presented yearly by ten of the world's leading human rights organizations. Ms Moudeïna is the lawyer for the victims of the exiled former dictator of Chad, Hissène Habré. In February 2000, a Senegalese court indicted Habré on charges of torture and crimes against humanity, and placed him under house arrest. It was the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. In March 2001, however, Senegal's Court of Final Appeals ruled that Habré could not be tried in Senegal for crimes allegedly committed in Chad. The victims are now seeking Habré's extradition to stand trial in Belgium, and Senegal has accepted a United Nations request not to let Habré leave Senegal except via extradition. This month, the Chadian government announced that a Belgian judge would be able to visit Chad to interview witnesses and gather evidence against Habré. In the meantime, Ms Moudeïna took an enormous personal risk by filing criminal complaints in Chad itself against a number of Habré's accomplices, including the heads of Habré's political police, the dreaded DDS, many of whom are still in positions of power in Chad. She had already received a number of threats when, on June 11, 2001, a security squad, led by Mahamat Wakayé, one of the men she is suing, threw a grenade at her while she was participating in a peaceful demonstration to protest the conduct of the Chadian presidential elections. Ms Moudeïna was severely injured from the shrapnel and still walks on crutches seven months later. Several others were injured as well. The security forces also apparently fired on the car that was driving the injured Ms Moudeïna away from the scene. The government has not arrested anyone for the attack. """"Jacky Moudeïna's work is a direct challenge to the continuing power of those who terrorized Chad in the Habré years,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, who coordinates the international case against Habré. """"Her determination to stand up for torture victims at great personal sacrifice is a shining example to us all."""" Brody again called on the Chadian government to bring Ms Moudeïna's attackers to justice. In a letter to Chadian President Idriss Déby prior to the attack, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights had requested the Chadian government to prevent ex-DDS agents still in official positions from interfering with the torture cases Ms. Moudeïna had filed. The Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders (MEA) is presented jointly by Amnesty International, Defense for Children, German Diakona, Human Rights Watch, HURIDOCS, International Alert, the International Commission of Jurists, the International Federation for Human Rights, the International Service for Human Rights and the World Organization Against Torture. Created in 1993, it is granted annually to an individual or an organization who has displayed exceptional courage in combating human rights violations. The previous recipients of the MEA have been: Peace Brigades International (2001), Immaculée Birhaheka, DRC; Natasa Kandic, Yugoslavia; Eyad El Sarraj, Palestine; Samuel Ruiz Garcia, Mexico; Clement Nwankwo, Nigeria; Asma Jahangir, Pakistan; Harry Wu, China (1994).

At the same time, the campaign offers a chance to focus attention on the denial of human rights and democracy in the Middle East and Central Asia, where authoritarian governments have left millions of people with a choice between extremist politics and no politics. Many of these authoritarian governments cling to power without challenge from Western governments.  The 670-page Human Rights Watch World Report 2002 includes summaries of human rights events in 2001 in 66 countries, as well as analyses of U.S. and European foreign policy, refugee issues, international justice, corporate social responsibility, and the weapons trade.  Some countries, such as Russia, Uzbekistan, and Egypt, are using the war on terror to justify abusive military campaigns or crackdowns on domestic political opponents. In the United States and Western Europe, measures designed to combat terrorism are threatening long-held human rights principles.  """"Terrorists believe that anything goes in the name of their cause,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The fight against terror must not buy into that logic. Human rights principles must not be compromised in the name of any cause.""""  The anti-terrorism campaign will not succeed if it is conducted merely as a struggle against a particularly ruthless set of criminals, Roth said. To defeat the fundamental amorality of terrorism requires a firm grounding in international human rights.  """"The fight against terror must reaffirm the principle that no civilian should ever be deliberately killed or abused,"""" said Roth. """"But for too many countries, the anti-terror mantra has provided a new reason to ignore human rights.""""  On Afghanistan, Roth said that the demise of the Taliban regime created an opportunity for positive change. But he urged that the international community devote real resources to bringing perpetrators to justice for past crimes. Establishing the rule of law will be essential for ending the cycle of atrocities in Afghanistan.  Roth said that Human Rights Watch had not yet conducted an on-the-ground investigation of civilian deaths in the U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan, but that serious questions had been raised by reports of civilian casualties.  Human Rights Watch does not generally take a position on whether particular wars should be fought, but does urge strict respect for international humanitarian law in the conduct of any war. Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. military to be more forthcoming about civilian casualties in Afghanistan.  Roth also said that new restrictions on civil liberties in the United States, such as the proposed military commissions, could compromise the U.S. government's ability to criticize human rights violations in other countries.  """"Imagine the U.S. condemning military tribunals set up by a tin-pot tyrant to get rid of his political enemies,"""" said Roth. """"That kind of criticism can have real sting. But now it will ring with hypocrisy -- if the Pentagon does not narrow President Bush's order on military commissions with appropriate guidelines."""" Anti-terror legislation in many Western European countries would have a similar effect on their abilities to provide international leadership on human rights, Roth said.  """"The fight against terror isn't just a matter of security,"""" said Roth. """"It's a matter of values.""""  The willingness of most Western governments to tolerate abuses by friendly governments in the Middle East and North Africa has tended to undermine the growth of a human rights culture there, Roth noted. The problems include the West's failure to rein in Israeli abuses against Palestinians, and its apparent disregard for grave civilian suffering caused by sanctions against Iraq.  """"In societies where basic freedoms flourish, citizens can press their government to respond to grievances,"""" said Roth. """"But in Saudi Arabia and other countries where Osama bin Laden strikes a chord of resentment, governments prohibit political debate.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/01/16/dangerous-security","A Dangerous Security","A Dangerous Security","","01/16/2002","The US government´s single overriding goal since September 11 has been to defeat terrorism. Determined as this campaign has been, it remains to be seen whether it is merely a fight against a particularly ruthless set of criminals or also an effort to conquer the logic of terrorism. Is it a struggle against only Osama bin Laden, his al-Qaeda network and a few like-minded groups? Or is it also an effort to undermine the view that anything goes in the name of a cause, the belief that even the slaughter of civilians is an acceptable political act? The answer to these questions will, in the long run, determine the success of the campaign. If it is conceived broadly, as it should, the fight against terrorism must be understood as a campaign for human rights. That is because it is the body of international human rights and humanitarian law, and its limits on permissible conduct, that explains why terrorism is not a legitimate act of war or politics. It is the human-rights cause that stands for the principle that civilians should never be deliberately killed, regardless of the cause. Yet the urgency of the effort to defeat particular terrorists has tempted governments to compromise human rights. Many of the governments joining the fight against terrorism have yet to decide whether this battle provides an opportunity to reaffirm the principles of human rights or a new reason to ignore them; whether this is a moment to embrace values governing means and ends, or an excuse to subordinate means to ends. Their choices will not determine whether any particular perpetrator is captured or killed. But over the long term it will affect the strength of the ends-justify-the-means rationalisation that underlies terrorism. Unless the global anti-terror coalition firmly rejects this amorality, unless the rules of international human rights and humanitarian law clearly govern all anti-terror actions, the battle against particular terrorists risks reaffirming the warped instrumentalism of terrorism. The fight against terrorism should be seen only in part as a matter of security. It is also a matter of values. Police, intelligence units, even armies all have a role to play in meeting particular terrorist threats. But terrorism emanates as well from the realm of public morality. It may never be possible to understand the pathology that led a group of men to attack thousands of civilians on September 11. But it is essential to understand the mores that would countenance such mass murder as a legitimate political tool. Sympathy for such crimes is the breeding ground for terrorism, and sympathisers are the potential recruits. Building a stronger human-rights culture – a culture in which any disregard for civilian life is condemned rather than condoned – is essential in the long run for defeating terrorism. The Consequences of Neglect A human-rights culture as an antidote to terrorism is needed especially in the Middle East and north Africa, where al-Qaeda seems to have attracted many of its adherents. This region, however, hardly has a monopoly on terrorism. Armed groups have attacked civilians to sow terror in the United Kingdom, Spain, Sri Lanka, India, Colombia and many other places. Yet today global attention has focused on al-Qaeda because of the target of its antipathy – the world´s superpower – and the magnitude of its alleged crimes. Unfortunately, the willingness of most western governments to tolerate abuses in the region has tended to undermine a human-rights culture. Most prominent has been the west´s failure to rein in Israeli abuses against Palestinians and its refusal to restructure sanctions against Iraq to minimise civilian suffering. This neglect has incited intense regional anger as the death toll mounts from Israeli-Palestinian violence and as Iraqi sanctions drag on with no indication that Saddam Hussein will acquiesce to United Nations´ demands. Less remarked upon, though still highly damaging, has been the west´s feeble commitment to human rights in places such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In Saudi Arabia, the native land of Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 presumed hijackers of September 11, the government imposes strict limits on civil society, severely discriminates against women and systematically suppresses dissent. But the west has contented itself with purchasing Saudi oil and soliciting Saudi contracts while maintaining a silence toward Saudi abuses. Egypt, the native land of the alleged September 11 ringleader and other key al-Qaeda leaders, features a narrowly circumscribed political realm and a government that does all it can to suffocate peaceful opposition. Yet as a partner for Middle East peace, the government has secured massive US aid and tacit western acceptance of its human-rights violations. In societies where basic freedoms flourish, citizens can press their governments to respond to grievances. But in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and many of the other countries where Osama bin Laden strikes a chord of resentment, governments restrict popular debate about how to address society´s ills. As the option of peaceful political change is closed off, the voices of non-violent dissent are frequently upstaged by a politics of radical opposition. In a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy, the west has quietly accepted this pattern of repression because it fears the instability of the democratic alternative. Regional governments have played on this fear brilliantly. By silencing mainstream political opponents, they have created an environment in which they can credibly portray themselves as the only bulwark against extremism. They can credibly claim that human rights must be suppressed in order to be protected, that democratisation would lead to its own demise. The stark choice, they posit, has been reduced to blocking political liberalisation, as the Algerian military did in 1992 to head off an Islamist victory at the polls, or repeating the Iranian experience of 1979, in which the west´s backing away from the authoritarian Shah led to a repressive theocratic state. The challenge for the campaign against terrorism is to recognise the role that governmental repression plays in creating this dilemma. An immediate democratic transition may not be possible in such a warped political environment, but steps can and should be taken to begin to provide a meaningful array of electoral choices. Of course, in a democracy there is no guarantee of any particular political result. But if pressure is put on authoritarian governments to allow a spectrum of political options, the likelihood increases that democracy will lead to governments that respect human rights. A number of Middle Eastern and north African governments have begun the process of liberalisation without empowering extremists. In recent years, Morocco and Jordan have become more open societies, Qatar and Bahrain have begun to loosen political restraints and promised to hold elections, and Kuwait has allowed an elected parliament (though with limited powers, and no voting rights for women and many other native-born residents). Even in Iran, a gradual and partial political opening has corresponded with the emergence of a movement demanding respect for civil liberties. Although the correlation is not always neat, these experiences suggest that the appeal of violent and intolerant movements diminishes as people are given the chance to participate meaningfully in politics, and to select from a range of political parties and perspectives. Promoting this range of options should thus be a central part of any anti-terrorism strategy for the region. But if the west continues to accept repression as the best defence against radicalism, it will undermine the human-rights culture that is needed to achieve the ultimate goal of defeating terrorism. The Global Coalition A similar challenge exists outside the Middle East and north Africa. In the days following September 11, various governments tried to take advantage of the tragedy by touting their own internal struggles as battles against terrorism. Russian president Vladimir Putin embraced this rhetoric to defend his government´s brutal campaign in Chechnya. Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan did the same to justify his government´s response to political agitation in Xinjiang province. Malaysian deputy prime minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi defended administrative detention under his country´s long-abused Internal Security Act as """"an initial preventive measure before things get beyond control"""". A spokesman for Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe justified a crackdown on journalists who reported on his government´s abuses as an attack on supporters of terrorism. Russia´s experience showed that this cynical strategy could work. Shortly after September 11, German chancellor Gerhard Schröder and Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi said that Russia´s actions in Chechnya must be reassessed. The US government, which in April had supported a UN resolution condemning atrocities in Chechnya, began to play down its concerns over human rights and play up alleged links between Chechen rebels and the al-Qaeda network. Uzbekistan had a similar experience. The US State Department is required each year to name """"countries of particular concern"""" for their repression of religious freedom. With its torture and long prison sentences for Muslims who seek to pray peacefully outside the state- controlled mosque, Uzbekistan is an obvious candidate for this list. But as a front-line state for the war in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan avoided being named when the State Department issued the latest list in October. (The State Department also left Saudi Arabia off the list despite admitting that there is """"no religious freedom"""" there.) The message sent by this inconsistency was that violence becomes intolerable based not on whether civilians are attacked but on whose civilians are attacked and who is doing the attacking. To build a coalition on these terms hardly promotes broad public support for the human-rights culture needed to defeat terrorism. Another impediment to building such a global culture is Washington´s resistance to enforceable human-rights standards. That is not to say that the US government ignores human rights; most US citizens enjoy a wide range of rights protections. But Washington has never been willing to subject itself to binding international human-rights scrutiny. Even after September 11, when the Bush administration suddenly needed global cooperation to fight terrorism, its resistance to international human-rights law remained strong. The best illustration of this is the administration´s intensifying hostility toward the International Criminal Court (ICC), a potential forum for prosecuting future crimes against humanity. With the number of countries that have ratified the ICC treaty growing rapidly – 47 of the 60 needed to bring it into force were secured as of the end of 2001 – it is a virtual certainty that the treaty will come into effect in 2002. But Washington opposes the court because it theoretically could be used to scrutinise the conduct of US armed forces. Just two weeks before the bombing began in Afghanistan, the Bush administration endorsed proposed legislation that would permit sanctions against governments that ratify the ICC treaty (other than Nato members and certain other key allies) and would even authorise invasion of The Hague, where the court will be based, to liberate any US citizen who might find himself in the dock. The administration thus shows itself willing to seek global cooperation to protect its own citizens, but determined to undermine a global institution that many governments see as essential for protecting others. This resistance to accountability, replicated in international negotiations on climate change, nuclear weapons, biological weapons, small arms and racism, contributes to global unease about Washington´s use of force. The US government seems to assume that if its policy is to respect international humanitarian law, its military conduct should be beyond reproach. Few elsewhere share that view. And Washington´s refusal to submit to any independent enforcement machinery handicaps efforts to encourage others to respect international human-rights law. The West´s Indifference In the west, the magnitude of the September 11 crimes has led many to accept a scaling back of certain rights in the name of enhancing security. If everyone faced heightened scrutiny, the public might have resisted, or at least limited, this trend. But because anti-terrorism efforts have focused largely on a minority – young men from the Middle East and north Africa – the public has been more willing to countenance rights restrictions. Governments have been quick to take advantage of this. The most egregious illustration was president Bush´s order establishing military commissions to prosecute non-US citizens. The order was troubling, first, for the breadth of the crimes over which it would have jurisdiction. It authorises tribunals to try people accused of membership in al-Qaeda, involvement in the undefined crime of international terrorism or harbouring anyone charged with these offences. The tribunals´ scope could thus extend far beyond any traditional use of military tribunals – to address offences by combatants in war – to reach people who might be charged with acts far removed from Afghanistan or any other armed conflict. Second, the order was virtually devoid of procedural protections. Standing alone, it raised the prospect of suspects being tried, convicted and even executed with no appearance before an independent tribunal, no right to appeal, no right to a public trial, no presumption of innocence, no right to confront evidence or testimony, and no requirement that proof be established beyond a reasonable doubt. While promising """"a full and fair trial"""", the order explicitly rejected scrutiny of the military commission´s rulings by any other court. It also ignored the Uniform Code of Military Justice – the procedural code used for regular courts-martial – which would have ensured most rights of a fair trial. Administration officials have suggested that some of these due-process transgressions will be remedied through the adoption of additional regulations, but none had been issued by the end of 2001. Such indifference to human-rights standards makes it difficult to ensure that justice is done and can be seen to be done. It also threatens to silence Washington´s routine objections to similar military tribunals used against alleged terrorists (including US citizens) in Peru, Nigeria, Russia and other countries around the globe. Those protests will be hard to sustain when tomorrow´s military dictators need only photocopy the Bush order to secure a highly effective mechanism for repression. Other governments have shown a similar tendency to subordinate human rights to the fight against terrorism. Australian prime minister John Howard, stoking post-September 11 fears of foreigners, built his candidacy for re-election in November around his summary expulsion, in blatant violation of international refugee law, of asylum seekers who had reached outlying Australian territory. Proposed EU-wide security measures include a broad definition of terrorism that threatens freedom of association and the right to dissent, a European arrest warrant to facilitate transfer of terrorist suspects without safeguards for a fair trial and a re-evaluation of the right to seek asylum in light of new security considerations. A new British law permits the prolonged arbitrary detention of foreigners suspected of terrorist activity. These steps matter because it is profoundly more difficult to promote the values of human rights if some of the most visible and powerful proponents seek to exempt themselves from the same standards. Such exceptionalism has grown since September 11, as governments seek to justify extraordinary constraints on rights in the name of combating extraordinary threats. Yet in the long term, this trend will prove counterproductive. If the logic of terrorism is ultimately to be defeated, governments must redouble their commitment to international standards, not indulge in a new round of excuses to ignore them.","United States, Global",""

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) will meet to discuss the parameters of a possible repatriation program for some 1,000 indigenous minority asylum seekers from the Central Highlands of Vietnam, collectively known as Montagnards, who are currently sheltered in Cambodia.  """"The Vietnamese government has made access to the Central Highlands difficult, but everything we know suggests that it's still not safe for Montagnards in Cambodia to go home,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"There is substantial evidence that the government's crackdown in the Central Highlands is systematic and ongoing.""""  Recent information obtained by Human Rights Watch shows a relentless government campaign in the Central Highlands against Montagnards, particularly those following Evangelical Christianity and those who participated in unprecedented land rights demonstrations that took place in the highlands in February 2001. As recently as late December 2001, dozens of Montagnard Christians were rounded up and arrested while trying to organize Christmas ceremonies and prayer services. On December 28, Cambodian authorities in Mondolkiri province deported 167 Montagnards, who had fled across the border from Vietnam. While some of the women in the group have subsequently been returned to their villages, many of the men are still missing.  """"No one should be returned to Vietnam against their will or until independent monitors are in place in the highlands to ensure that there are no reprisals,"""" said Saunders. """"And even if a repatriation agreement is achieved and some people decide to go home, this should not trigger the closure of the UNHCR camps in Cambodia for those who remain, nor bar the provision of asylum to others continuing to flee persecution in Vietnam.""""  Since the February 2001 protests, human rights violations against Montagnards have included destruction and closure of ethnic minority churches, bans on public gatherings, travel restrictions, official pressure on Christians to abandon their religion under threat of legal action or imprisonment, and the arrest and mistreatment of returnees from Cambodia. Dozens of Montagnards who participated in the February 2001 protests have been arrested over the last year, with more than thirty given harsh prison sentences in trials conducted between September and November 2001.  Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese government to cease the arbitrary arrest, surveillance and harassment of Montagnards suspected of participating in last February's demonstrations, stop its persecution of Montagnard Christians, and release all Montagnards imprisoned for peaceful expression of their religious and political views. In addition, Human Rights Watch urged Vietnam to allow unhindered access to the highlands by UNHCR, journalists, diplomats and independent human rights monitors.  Human Rights Watch also called on the government of Cambodia to continue to uphold its obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention by providing temporary asylum to Montagnards fleeing Vietnam, regardless of whether any UNHCR-endorsed repatriation commences, and to put an end to forced returns of asylum seekers.  The first round of tripartite repatriation talks, conducted in July 2001 in Hanoi, broke down after Vietnam refused to allow the UN to have unrestricted access to the Central Highlands to monitor the repatriation. The Vietnamese delegation reportedly also questioned the need for any repatriation program to be voluntary, charging instead that the Montagnard asylum seekers were illegal immigrants in Cambodia.  The main indigenous minority groups affected by the crackdown in the Central Highlands provinces of Dak Lak, Gia Lai, Kontum, and Lam Dong include Jarai, Ede, Pnong, Bahnar, Stieng, and Koho.","Asia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Religious Freedom"

Yañez criticized the Chilean judiciary on a television show late last year, and he now faces up to five years of imprisonment under a criminal law provision that covers anyone who """"in word or deed gravely insults the higher courts of justice."""" """"With this action the Chilean Supreme Court has taken a giant leap backwards on freedom of expression,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Criticism of the authorities, including the judiciary, is part of the cut and thrust of public debate in a democracy. The courts are supposed to protect this right, not to violate it.""""  Yañez was a panelist on an award-winning Chilean debate show called """"The Thermometer"""" that seeks to gauge opinion from ordinary members of the public on controversial issues. On November 27, the topic was miscarriage of justice. After being asked for his reaction to the testimony of a woman who said that she had received no word of apology from the courts after being wrongly sentenced to fifteen years in jail for killing her infant son, an indignant Yañez said """"the justice system is immoral, cowardly and corrupt . . . I think not to show its face is a sign of moral cowardice (mariconada).""""  Yañez expected to be detained and charged under Article 263 of the penal code last week, but after hearing his account Judge Juan Muñoz unusually decided to give him ten working days to apologize or persuade the Supreme Court to drop the prosecution. However, Justice Mario Garrido Montt, the newly appointed president of the Supreme Court, refused to meet with Yañez or his lawyers. Human Rights Watch was also denied a meeting with Justice Garrido last week.  More than thirty Chileans have been prosecuted, and several jailed, for the crime of contempt of authority since Chile regained democracy in 1990. All were charged under a provision of the Law of State Security that was finally repealed last year after a long campaign by human rights groups.  Chile's congress, however, voted down a proposal by the government to repeal the similarly worded provisions of the penal code used in this case. Until now, these penal code provisions have been rarely used.  """"It is a disgrace that it was the Supreme Court, whose duty it is to safeguard the rights of citizens, which chose to break new ground with this prosecution,"""" said Vivanco.  The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, which interceded with the Chilean government on Yañez' behalf, has given the government seven days to explain its action, which clearly violates Chile's obligations under Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights.","Americas, Chile","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

The first message is that the camp will be no tropical resort. As a senior officer noted, """"comfortable"""" will not be a word used to describe the detainees' accommodations. The other message is that the detainees will be treated humanely. This is the more important message, as international law requires, at a minimum, humane treatment for all persons captured during armed conflicts. The U.S. government may, however, not fully understand what international law requires. News reports have indicated that Taliban and al-Qaida detainees will be confined in small cages covered with metal roofs with chain-link sides and concrete floors. The cages will offer scant shelter from wind, rain and cold. Details about sanitary and hygiene facilities at the camp have not been publicly released. This is not the first time detainees have been held at Guantanamo Bay. In 1994, the U.S. government responded to refugees fleeing from Haiti and then Cuba by creating a temporary holding facility at the base. While conditions there were stark and hardly hospitable, the detainees were held in permanent hard-walled shelters. The United States is a party to the Geneva Conventions, the laws governing the treatment of persons captured during armed conflict. Every captured fighter is entitled to humane treatment, understood at a minimum to include basic shelter, clothing, food and medical attention. In addition, no detainee - even if suspected of war crimes such as the murder of civilians - may be subjected to torture, corporal punishment, or humiliating or degrading treatment. If they are tried for crimes, the trials must satisfy certain basic fair trial guarantees. Prisoners of war are entitled to further protections, commensurate with respect for their military status as soldiers. Indeed, the Geneva Conventions provide that prisoners of war must be quartered in conditions that meet the same general standards as the quarters available to the captor's forces, e.g. the U.S. armed forces. Not all of the detainees shipped to Cuba are considered POWs. Under the Geneva Conventions, captured fighters are POWs if they are members of an adversary state's armed forces or are part of an identifiable militia group that abides by the laws of war. Most members of al-Qaida, wearing no insignia or abiding by the laws of war, would probably not qualify as prisoners of war. But Taliban soldiers, whether Afghan or foreign, comprised the armed forces of Afghanistan and should be entitled to POW status. If there is doubt about anyone's status as a prisoner of war, the Geneva Conventions require that he be treated as such until a competent tribunal determines otherwise. To our knowledge, no tribunals have made any such determinations. Which brings us back to the cages in Cuba. The United States would never house members of its armed forces in chain-link cages, nor would it accept such treatment for any of its soldiers captured by enemy forces. Such conditions are simply unacceptable for anyone, much less people entitled to be treated as POWs. It may be difficult for Americans who have lived through the horror of Sept. 11 and its aftermath to accept the idea that anyone captured during the fighting in Afghanistan has basic rights that must be respected. But to think otherwise is to accept the values of terrorism. Those who were willing to send airplanes into office buildings deny the fundamental dignity and human rights possessed by every human being -even one's enemy. In fighting terrorism, the United States must show that it operates with a different set of values, the values affirmed by international human rights and humanitarian law.","United States",""

Their legal appeal to the Court of Cassation resumes on January 16, 2002. Ibrahim suffers from a degenerative neurological condition requiring immediate specialist treatment. The court has not yet responded to his separate appeal, filed in July 2001, for suspension of sentence on medical grounds.  """"The arrest, prosecution, and conviction of Professor Ibrahim and his colleagues is a complete scandal,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"In his case, incarceration is not only arbitrary and unjust but has become a humanitarian issue as well.""""  The first session of the legal appeal, on December 19, 2001, was adjourned without a decision by the court's seven-member bench. The court also postponed a decision on a separate application by defense lawyers for a temporary suspension of sentences pending the outcome of the appeal, and failed to respond at all to the separate medical appeal of Ibrahim.  In an updated twenty-one-page report on the case released today, Human Rights Watch said that the trial was politically motivated and unfair at every stage. Ibrahim, a sociology professor and head of the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies, an independent nongovernmental organization, was sentenced in May 2001 to seven years of imprisonment after being convicted on charges of receiving foreign funds without official permission, disseminating false information damaging to Egypt's stature abroad, and fraud.  Three colleagues were sentenced to two years in prison with labor on the fraud charge. Two other defendants, convicted on separate charges of bribery and forgery, received five-year sentences with labor.  At the December 19 hearing, the Court of Cassation's own prosecution office, a body that is independent of the office of the General Prosecution and that advises the court's judges on the merits of legal arguments, agreed on a number of points raised by the defense, and recommended that the seven-member bench uphold the appeal and order a retrial.  During the session, Saadeddin Ibrahim's defense lawyer reiterated his July application, on medical grounds, for a temporary suspension of sentence pending the outcome of the appeal. Ibrahim's health has deteriorated during his incarceration, and recent tests have shown damage to his spinal cord and the motor regions of the brain. The court took no decision on the substance of the appeal or on the temporary suspension of sentence.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","Free Speech"

In the name of safeguarding democracy from religious extremism, the new military rulers canceled the second round of voting, ousted the president, banned the front and arrested its leaders and supporters. Western powers, along with many Algerians of good faith, were relieved to see the army block the Islamists' victory, no matter how free and fair the vote may have been. They feared that the front, once in control of the legislature, would jettison democracy, back militant causes abroad and trample the rights of women and others who rejected their interpretation of Islam. Free elections in the Middle East may have outcomes that scare Western democracies. But as Algeria's black decade shows, Western interests and values are ill served by failing to hold accountable regimes that claim legitimacy on the grounds that they are bulwarks against theocracy. Yet Western governments are today drawing closer to the Algerian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has loudly endorsed President George W. Bush's war on terrorism. Since July, the two leaders have met twice at the White House, the first such presidential meetings since 1985. Algeria has reportedly handed the United States a list of 350 Algerians abroad with links to Qaida. The Bush administration is said to have eased restrictions on arms sales to Algeria that would aid the security forces in combating armed groups. Since the elections were stopped a decade ago, up to 150,000 Algerians have been killed in a conflict between ruthless security forces and armed Islamists, whose jihad degenerated long ago into the butchering of civilians. In 10 years, the authorities have not brought the country closer to democracy, tackled the economic problems that fuel political extremism or kept terrorism from spilling beyond the country's borders. True, the government's military superiority and its controversial amnesty for insurgents have reduced the death toll to about 100 per month, and the country has an elected president and Parliament again. But the political system remains tightly controlled by a military- dominated clique, and ordinary citizens get angry about the same old issues government arrogance and corruption, 30 percent unemployment, severe shortages of water and housing, and an economy that is in a shambles. These same issues led millions to vote for the Islamic Salvation Front in 1991. Last year the frustrations of the Berber population erupted into deadly confrontations with the security forces. Algeria's conflict has fed terrorism in the West, from a spate of fatal bombings in Paris in the mid-1990s to the many Algerians arrested in Europe in recent months on suspicion of Qaida links. But it would be self-defeating for the West to embrace the Algerian government as an anti-terrorist ally without also pushing it on the political and human rights issues that contribute to long-term stability. Oil-rich Algeria may seem impervious to outside pressure, but President Bouteflika's incessant foreign travel, and his signing Dec. 19 of an association agreement with the European Union that contains a clause on human rights, testify to the government's eagerness for international legitimacy. Western governments should be telling Algiers that closer ties depend on curtailing the impunity enjoyed by the security forces, not only for their unlawful actions against suspected Islamists, but also for their killing of dozens of unarmed demonstrators for Berber rights in 2001. Legislative elections this spring must be freer than the last ones, held in 1997. All political parties committed to nonviolence and pluralism should be allowed to compete. Such measures will not persuade all militants at home or abroad to lay down their weapons. But they will signal a commitment by the government to address at last some of the conditions that have helped to make Algeria both a victim and exporter of violent extremism.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria","Religious Freedom"

On January 9, Colombian President Andrés Pastrana announced the end of three years of peace negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC-EP). In January 1999, guerrillas took control over a 15,000-square mile area, known as the zona de despeje. The government withdrew its security forces. Approximately 90,000 Colombians live in the area, which covers five municipalities in the departments of Meta and Caquetá.

Since the December 26 killing of Munyarubuga, authorities have detained and interrogated Pasteur Bizimungu, former president of Rwanda and the leading figure of the Ubuyanja party; another member of Ubuyanja; three persons associated with a faction of the Democratic Republican Movement (MDR) thought to be opposed to the current government; and a journalist who reported on these developments. “The police should put their energies into prosecuting Munyarubuga’s killers rather than into intimidating people whose ideas they don’t like,” said Alison Des Forges, Senior Adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. Munyarubuga, a 66-year-old taxi driver, was shot by two men who had entered his taxi as passengers. Uniformed members of the Local Defense Force, an official police agency, reportedly stood by and failed to apprehend the killers. He was killed in the early afternoon in a wealthy neighborhood in the capital of Kigali. Munyarubuga had reportedly been threatened with death by police on December 10 when he visited Bizimungu at his home and on several subsequent occasions.  Police reportedly arrested Catherine Mujawamariya, also a founder of Ubuyanja, on December 10. They have also detained others who sought to visit Bizimungu or have prevented them from seeing him. Both Bizimungu and party spokesman, Charles Ntakirutinka, have been restricted from leaving the capital.  Authorities refused to allow Bizimungu to officially establish a new political party last June, and in late November prevented him from publishing a brief memoir. Bizimungu and his associates, who were attacked by street gangs several months ago, were again threatened recently. Others in opposition to the government, including former speaker of the National Assembly Joseph Sebarenzi, denounced these threats. Sebarenzi, now in exile in the United States, called for protection for Ubuyanja members in a Voice of America broadcast two days before Munyarubuga was murdered. A group called the Movement for Peace, Democracy and Development, said to be operating clandestinely inside Rwanda, detailed harassment of Ubuyanja members in a report circulated shortly after Munyarubuga’s death.  Authorities have also detained Pierre Gakwandi, recently elected secretary-general of one faction of the MDR party, and interrogated other MDR members, including former deputy Leonard Kavutse and a former ambassador.  From December 31 to January 3 police detained Amiel Nkuliza, journalist of Le Partisan newspaper, questioning him about his reports of Munyarubuga’s killing and about the MDR party. When first detained, he was reportedly forced to telephone friends to reassure them so that they would not seek to locate him.  “If authorities have reason to suspect all these people have committed some crime, they should charge them. Otherwise they should allow them the freedom of opinion and expression guaranteed by Rwandan and international law,” said Des Forges.","Africa, Rwanda","Free Speech"

It was the first death sentence that has been carried out since Sharia (Islamic law) was extended to cover criminal offences in several northern states of Nigeria.  Several other people in Nigeria have been sentenced to death by Sharia courts– but not yet executed – including a pregnant woman in Sokoto State who was found guilty in October 2001 of having pre-marital sex. Sharia courts have also sentenced defendants to other cruel punishments, including floggings and amputations.  “The death penalty is an inhuman, degrading and cruel punishment which cannot be justified in any circumstance, however brutal the crime of which the defendant is accused,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “As the first execution under Sharia in Nigeria, we fear that this may signal a willingness on the part of the authorities to carry out further death sentences in future.”  The defendant, Sani Yakubu Rodi, aged about 21, was hanged in Kaduna Prison on January 3 2002. A Sharia court in Katsina found him guilty of the murder of a woman and her two children: a four-year-old boy and a three-month-old girl. The victims were stabbed to death in their home. Sani Yakubu Rodi was reportedly caught at the scene of the murder and immediately arrested by the police.  Sani Yakubu Rodi did not have legal representation at any stage of his trial; he apparently told the court that he would defend himself. In the initial hearing on 5 July, he pleaded not guilty. However, in a subsequent hearing on 4 September, he changed to a guilty plea. The court sentenced him to death on 5 November. He did not take up the opportunity to appeal, and his death sentence was subsequently confirmed and his execution authorized by the Governor of Katsina State.  Human Rights Watch called on the Nigerian Government and judiciary to stop the imposition of cruel punishments and to ensure that international standards of fair trial are guaranteed in all courts, including Sharia courts. Human Rights Watch is also appealing to state governors – who make the final decision in death penalty cases – to commute any future death sentences.  Human Rights Watch also warned that executions under Sharia are likely to heighten tensions between Muslims and non-Muslims in northern Nigeria. In recent months there have been violent religious clashes, resulting in killings and destruction.","Africa, Nigeria","Women's Rights"

The fifteen, including former cabinet minister Ezatollah Sahabi, are scheduled to go on trial today before Branch 26 of Iran’s Revolutionary Court in Tehran. All face charges of """"acts against national security,"""" planning to """"overthrow the system,"""" and “membership in the National Religious Alliance.”  “These individuals have been persecuted solely for expressing their political views in a peaceful and legal manner,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The government has provided no evidence whatsoever to justify their incarceration.”  The National Religious Alliance (NRA) is a loosely knit group of activists who favor political reform and who advocate the implementation of constitutional provisions to uphold the rule of law. The grouping, which has no formal structure, came together to contest the parliamentary elections of 2000.  Sahabi, arrested in December 2000, continues to be held in an unknown location. The other fourteen, arrested in March 2001, were held incommunicado for three months in a Tehran detention center known as Prison 59. They were subsequently permitted short visits with immediate family members outside the prison, in the main Ministry of Justice building. For most of their detention they were held in solitary confinement.  Nine of the detainees—Mohammad Maleki, Mohammad Hossein Rafiei, Alireza Rajaei, Reza Alijani, Mohmmad Basteh Negar, Mahmoud Omrani, Massoud Pedram, Morteza Kazemian and Mohmmad Mohammadi Ardehali—were released on bail during the summer months of 2001. The other five—Taghi Rahmani, Habibollah Payman, Reza Raeis-Toussi, Saeid Madani and Hoda Saber—remain incarcerated in Prison 59.  Prison 59, located in a Revolutionary Guard military installation in Eshratabad, in central Tehran, is an unregulated detention facility, not formally part of the penal system. All of the detainees, many of whom are elderly, have complained of harsh treatment while in detention. They were beaten by their captors and for much of the time held in small cells where they could only lie down in a cramped position.  Lawyers were not given any information about charges or evidence against their clients until last week. Instructed that they would only be allowed to review the prosecution files if they signed an undertaking not to discuss the contents in public, they refused and therefore have not yet seen the prosecution case against their clients.  Conditions of detention of several detainees have been especially alarming. Human Rights Watch was told that while in detention, Ezatollah Sahabi was hospitalized twice with heart attacks. His medications have since been increased, but he has not been permitted to meet with his own doctor. His family reports that during visits held outside his place of detention, he has looked extremely weak and disoriented, although his condition has reportedly improved in the last two months.  Dr. Habibollah Payman, 66, a dentist, suffers from severe kidney and urinary tract problems, but was given only limited toilet access. He was forced to use the drinking vessel in his cell to relieve himself, rinsing it out when given access to the bathroom.  Dr. Raeis Toussi, 65, a law professor at Tehran University, had one interrogation session which lasted more than 24 hours, and three that exceeded 18 hours each, all of which exacerbated a serious back injury.  Hossein Zare Dehnoi, the presiding judge, told family members in September that the President’s office had requested from the Judiciary permission to send an observer to visit with the detainees in Prison 59, but was denied.  Hojatoleslam Marvi, Deputy Head of the Judiciary has told family members that since the Ministry of Information has publicly criticized this prosecution as having no merit, it was not possible to hold the detainees in official prisons, where the Information Ministry is responsible for security.  Revolutionary Court procedures, in which a single judge also serves as prosecutor, violates Article 168 of the Constitution, which provides for public trial by jury in cases involving “political offenses.” Safeguards in the Iranian Criminal Procedure Code have also been ignored.

In letters addressed to the foreign ministers from the six member states due to attend the meeting, Human Right Watch stressed that """"a commitment to abiding by human rights law in fighting terrorism is important not only as a matter of principle but also as a matter of efficacy.""""   The SCO, established to promote economic cooperation and regional security in Central Asia, includes China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan.   """"The fight against terrorism should include steps to promote tolerance between different ethnic and religious groups. Repressive and abusive behavior by security forces only creates the conditions in which terrorists can build support,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Respecting human rights has to be a key element of the Shanghai group's effort.""""   The letter reminded the SCO of previous statements on human rights and terrorism adopted by the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE); five of the six governments in the SCO are OSCE members.   Human Rights Watch also warned that in China, Uzbekistan, and Russia, serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law are being committed in the name of combating terrorism, including:  a crackdown on Uighur activists and religious groups in Xinjiang, China;  a relentless assault on independent Muslims in Uzbekistan; and  the torture and arbitrary arrest of scores of civilians in Chechnya by Russian forces. Human Rights Watch urged the SCO to develop a regional plan to reaffirm its human rights commitments as an integral part of its anti-terrorism agenda, and to include an international human rights expert on the staff of an anti-terrorism center the SCO plans to set up in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, China and Tibet, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

We welcome your plan to focus discussion in the upcoming meeting on combating terrorism, which by its very nature violates international law prohibitions against targeting civilians. Indeed, at its formation last June, the SCO anticipated the security challenges in Central Asia that have become a worldwide preoccupation since the September 11 attacks took thousands of civilian lives. We hope that as you continue your pursuit of this agenda next week, you will pay close attention to the importance of upholding human rights as part of any successful anti-terrorism effort. A commitment to abiding by human rights law in fighting terrorism is important not only as a matter of principle, but also as a matter of efficacy. SCO member states have embraced these ideas in numerous recent meetings.  In adopting Decision No. 1 on Combating Terrorism at the December Ministerial Meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), five of the six SCO states recognized that while """"no circumstance or cause can justify acts of terrorism, …various social economic, political and other factors . . . engender conditions in which terrorist organizations are able to recruit and win support."""" To address these concerns, the OSCE member states embraced preventive action against terrorism, including efforts """"to build democratic institutions"""" and to """"promote and enhance tolerance, coexistence and harmonious relations between ethnic, religious, linguistic and other groups.""""  In the same vein, the 13-14 December Bishkek International Conference on Enhancing Security and Stability in Central Asia, co-sponsored by the OSCE and the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention, adopted a """"Programme of Action"""" that commits convening states """"to prevent and to combat terrorism by increasing cooperation in the fields of human rights and fundamental freedoms and by strengthening the rule of law and the building of democratic institutions, based in part, on the funding of relevant programmes of the U.N. as well as the OSCE.""""  A separate OSCE conference on """"Media Freedom in Times of Anti-Terrorist Conflict"""" in Almaty on 10-11 December stressed that """"[t]he governments of the Anti-Terror Alliance should not, in times of conflict, use national security arguments to limit human rights at home and reduce their support elsewhere"""" and """"[i]n particular, the governments of the Central Asian States should not take the new conflict situation as a justification for repressive steps against opposition media.""""  Moreover, Security Council resolution 1373 adopted in late September, requiring member states to take several specific measures to combat terrorism, also calls upon them to do so in accordance with the relevant provisions of international and national law, including international standards of human rights. The chairman of the Security Council Counter Terrorism Committee created by resolution 1373 has recently announced that the committee will be adding a human rights expert to its staff.  While we welcome these commitments, we are deeply concerned that these ideals are not being reflected in SCO member state action to combat terrorism. In Uzbekistan, the government has for years used the fight against terrorism to justify its campaign against independent Islam. In this campaign, thousands of persons have been harassed, arrested, tortured, and imprisoned for up to twenty years for their peaceful religious beliefs, activities, and affiliations. They have been prosecuted for membership in banned religious organizations or for distributing banned literature, and have been branded as terrorists even though the vast majority is never charged with involvement in acts of terrorism. In Uzbekistan, and throughout Central Asia, the independent media is censored or non-existent, and independent organizations are harassed and shut down.  In Russia, the government undertook military operations in Chechnya in 1999 as a campaign to fight terrorism, but it initially rejected the applicability of international humanitarian law to its armed forces operating there. After September 11, the Russian government was quick to point to the links between certain field commanders in Chechnya and al-Qaeda, while its security forces have continued to violate international humanitarian law by blurring the distinction between combatants and civilians, and between those suspected of terrorism and the population at large. In recent months Russian forces have subjected scores of civilians to arbitrary and unlawful arrest, torture, """"disappearance,"""" and extrajudicial execution.  In China, the leadership has used the international campaign against terrorism to intensify its crackdown in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. On 18 September, the government first linked Chinese support for the global campaign against terrorism to U.S. support for its crackdown, and later supplied what it characterized as """"conclusive evidence"""" that separatist elements in Xinjiang have been involved in domestic and international terrorism. However, in a nationwide anti-crime campaign begun in April 2001 partially aimed at those suspected of supporting independence in ethnic regions, Chinese authorities have failed to differentiate between peaceful expression of political views and incidents of violence. In the effort to control dissent, the government also has further impinged on freedom of religious expression, arresting Muslims for such acts as so-called illegal preaching and translating the Koran into local languages.  These serious human rights violations, though often committed in the name of combating terrorism, do little to advance the cause. In your meeting next week, we urge SCO member states to reaffirm their human rights commitments, and, moreover, develop a regional plan to implement those commitments as part of the fight against terrorism. We hope the SCO will take advantage of the human rights monitoring, training, and implementation activities of the U.N. and the OSCE and include an international human rights expert on the staff of the anti-terrorism center being established by the SCO in Kyrgyzstan.  Please accept our best wishes for a productive meeting.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2002/01/03/iran-parliamentarians-convicted","Iran- Parliamentarians Convicted","Iran: Parliamentarians Convicted","Other Reformist MPs at Risk","01/03/2002","Human Rights Watch today expressed grave concern about the politically motivated convictions in late December of Iranian parliamentarian Hossein Loghmanian and two other Members of Parliament.  Human Rights Watch said it feared some sixty other parliamentarians from the majority reformist movement in Iran were at risk of imminent arrest at the hands of the conservative dominated judiciary.  “This is a blatant attempt to intimidate and silence Iran’s parliament,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. “The imprisonment of parliamentarians for conducting debates and representing their constituents’ point of view marks a new low for Iran.”  Iran’s judiciary issued a statement several days after Loghmanian’s arrest on December 25. The statement said Loghmanian had been jailed for describing the courts as “unjust,” for saying journalists convicted of “insulting Islamic sanctities” were “brave,” and for denouncing the courts’ decision to close offending newspapers. This was apparently a reference to a speech Loghmanian, an MP from Hamadan province, gave in parliament last year in which he had criticized the judiciary for “decapitating freedom of expression” and “attempting to threaten and intimidate parliament” by its closure of many pro-reform newspapers. Loghmanian had also denounced the arrest of Ezatollah Sahabi, a political veteran who has been detained without trial in an unknown location for more than a year.  On December 20, an appeals court confirmed a ten-month sentence against Loghmanian for libel and slander of the judiciary. Loghmanian’s arrest coincided with a visit by the parliament’s speaker, Mehdi Karroubi, to Saudi Arabia, repeating a pattern of political conservatives acting against reformists while prominent reformist leaders are on high-profile foreign visits.  Loghmanian is one of several MP’s who have become targets of judiciary wrath for critical comments of domestic political developments. The judiciary announced on December 26 that a second MP, Fatemeh Haghighatjou from Tehran, would be jailed for seventeen months after losing her appeal in a similar case. Haghighatjou had criticized the Revolutionary Court for its reliance on defendants’ confessions, which she said have been coerced by torture. She also condemned arrests and detentions carried out without necessary warrants. Although she was acquitted of a charge of propagating against the establishment, she was found guilty of “insulting the judiciary and spreading lies.”  On December 10, a third MP, Mohammad Dadfar from Bushehr, was sentenced to a seven-month imprisonment and a fine of two million Rials ($2000) on charges of spreading lies and insulting state officials; to date he has not been imprisoned. Since April 2000, more than sixty MPs of the majority reformist movement have been summoned to court for matters believed to be politically motivated.  Article 86 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran provides that “Members of parliament are completely free to express their views and cast their votes in the course of performing their duties as representatives, and they cannot be prosecuted or arrested for opinions expressed in the parliament or votes cast in the course of performing their duties as representatives.”  Judicial officials have responded to criticism that Loghmanian’s arrest and conviction violates parliamentary immunity by stating that all citizens are equal before the law, and therefore subject to the same limitations on their freedom of expression.  Human Rights Watch said Mr. Loghmanian’s statements fall well within the boundaries of speech protected under international law, including Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is a party, and that his conviction represents a violation of his basic right to freedom of expression.  The leadership of the parliamentary majority faction has called on Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to declare the prosecutions and imprisonment of parliamentarians unconstitutional. Iran’s conservatives, who are behind the prosecutions and control unelected institutions such as the judiciary; the Guardian Council (which oversees elections and pronounces on legislation); and the police, have the support of Ayatollah Khamenei, who has the final say in all state matters.  “These recent developments reflect badly on Ayatollah Khameini’s role as the protector of rights that are enshrined in Iran’s own Constitution,” said Megally. “His silence in the face of the political manipulation of the judiciary further undermines the rule of law in Iran.”","Middle East/North Africa, Iran","Free Speech"
