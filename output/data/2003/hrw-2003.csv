At least people have been freed from one of the world's most ruthless tyrants, they note. This humanitarian intervention argument was only occasionally mentioned before the war and was clearly not a dominant motivation for the invasion. Now that it has emerged as perhaps the strongest remaining justification, it is worth examining seriously. These include, foremost, that mass slaughter is ongoing or imminent, because only dire cases of large-scale carnage can justify war's deliberate taking of life. In addition, military action must be the last reasonable option; it must be guided primarily by a humanitarian motive; it must be reasonably likely to do more good than harm; it ideally, though not necessarily, should be endorsed by the UN Security Council or another significant multilateral authority; and it should be conducted in a way that maximises compliance with international humanitarian law. Avoiding Harm There are serious questions about whether the Iraq war met any of these criteria, but this essay looks only at the latter one. When considering compliance with international humanitarian law or the law of armed conflict, the key question is, did coalition forces take all feasible precautions during the March-April war to avoid civilian casualties? Most people with a superficial understanding of how the war was fought would answer this question with a resounding 'yes!' Our image of the American and British military at war is largely formed by videos of bombs or missiles hitting home with amazing precision. These pictures demonstrate an ability to launch attacks on fixed, pre-selected targets with remarkable accuracy. That precision is only part of the story. As required by the law of armed conflict, military planners also took various steps to minimise harm to civilians. They typically selected the time of day for attack when the fewest civilians were expected to be present, the angle of attack from which a miss was least likely to harm non-combatants, and the type of bomb or missile that was least likely to spread shrapnel or debris. Mistakes still happened, but these efforts to avoid harm were impressive. Unfortunately, coalition forces were less successful at avoiding civilian harm when attacking targets that arose unexpectedly in the course of war, as Human Rights Watch found in an extensive post-war field investigation of battlefield damage. The problem was not simply the reduced time to prepare, or the greater difficulty of hitting a moving target. Rather, coalition forces launched two types of operations - cluster-munition attacks in populated areas and assaults on Iraqi leaders using dangerously imprecise methods to locate them - that violated the requirement of international humanitarian law to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian harm. Iraqi troops also violated the law - often and blatantly. They used civilians as human shields, routinely stored military equipment in civilian areas, abused the Red Cross or Red Crescent symbols, and deployed antipersonnel landmines - all with a toll on non-combatants. Yet one side's violation of international humanitarian law does not absolve the other of its duty to comply. Regardless of Saddam's abysmal record, coalition troops were legally required to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Their failure to do so in these two important respects needlessly killed civilians. Scattershot The most fatal shortcoming was the use of cluster munitions in populated areas. These weapons open above ground, releasing dozens and sometimes hundreds of sub-munitions over a wide area. Each is capable of killing or severely injuring anyone in the vicinity. When used in populated areas, the scattershot nature of such weapons makes them extraordinarily dangerous for civilians. The danger continues long after the conflict because many sub-munitions do not explode on initial contact and become de facto landmines. Human Rights Watch's battlefield investigation following the 1999 war in Yugoslavia highlighted the danger. We found that roughly a quarter of the civilian deaths caused by NATO bombing were because of cluster munitions used in populated areas. To its credit, the US Air Force responded to this by significantly reducing its reliance on such munitions in built-up areas during the Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts, as did the Royal Air Force in Iraq. However, coalition ground forces in Iraq did not absorb that lesson. They used cluster munitions extensively in urban Baghdad, Basra, Karbala, Najaf and Hilla. More than a thousand civilians were killed or injured as a result. Indeed, on March 31 alone, US rocket-launched, cluster-munition attacks in Hilla killed at least 33 civilians and injured 109. A hospital director there told us that such weapons caused ninety percent of the civilian injuries that his hospital treated during the war. Inadequately Equipped Why would coalition ground forces use cluster munitions in a context that coalition air forces had apparently decided was too dangerous for civilians? The legendary lack of communication among the services is only part of the explanation.  Another reason is that the troops were inadequately equipped. For example, ground forces frequently used cluster munitions in response to incoming Iraqi .re. If the .re was within thirty kilometres, US troops had artillery capable of delivering more discriminate, unitary shells. Beyond that distance, the only available ground-based method of response was cluster munitions delivered by the Multiple Launch Rocket System. A typical volley of six rockets would spray nearly four thousand sub-munitions over a one-kilometre radius - a devastating attack in a civilian neighbourhood. British ground forces used L20A1 artillery projectiles, each of which scattered 49 sub-munitions - enough to wreak havoc in populated areas. But inadequate equipment was not the entire story, either. The alternative to cluster munitions was to suppress enemy .re with close air support from helicopters and gunships. Such support was generally more precise than cluster weapons, but it was also more dangerous for coalition forces because the aircraft were at risk of being shot down. US Marines appeared more willing to take that risk, but the US Army tended instead to shift the danger to Iraqi civilians by relying on cluster munitions, as did British ground forces. Decapitation Coalition air forces' relative attentiveness to civilian casualties in the use of cluster munitions was not matched when it came to the Pentagon's 'decapitation' strategy to kill Iraqi leaders. Assuming that a leader was in the military chain of command, he was a combatant who could legitimately be targeted during the war. But Human Rights Watch learned that of the fifty acknowledged attempts to killed leaders from the air, not a single one succeeded. Yet scores of civilians lost their lives in the process. A major reason for this embarrassing record is that the US Air Force tried to locate leaders principally by intercepting signals from the global positioning devices on the Thuraya satellite phones they favoured. This allowed the Pentagon to determine only that a target was somewhere within a hundred-metre radius. In the middle of the desert that might be enough to pinpoint a position, but in a populated region, where many of the decapitation strikes took place, that area could encompass numerous civilian structures. The Air Force says that, to focus the attack further, it supplemented the data from satellite-phone intercepts with information from other sources. But if other information existed, the lack of success suggests it was extraordinarily unreliable.  This inaccurate targeting had the effect of turning precision guided weapon strikes into indiscriminate attacks. The Air Force continued to aim at structures with great accuracy, but it could not reliably say whether they were legitimate military targets. For example, an April 7 decapitation attack, apparently aimed at Saddam on the basis of a satellite-phone intercept, killed eighteen civilians and destroyed three homes in the Mansur neighbourhood of Baghdad. An April 5 strike targeting Lieutenant General Ali Hassan al-Majid, better known as Chemical Ali, killed seventeen civilians in three homes in a densely populated section of Basra. Both survived the war and were later arrested. Tactical Correction Coalition ground forces' use of cluster munitions in populated areas and US Air Force strikes on poorly identified leadership targets occurred throughout the war. At some point, coalition officials should have seen that these methods were killing large numbers of civilians. But Washington and London's studied refusal to count civilian casualties made it more difficult to discern this pattern. Any possible embarrassment at having to disclose such figures should have given way to the possibility of learning about misguided tactics early enough to take corrective steps and save civilian lives. The legal requirement to take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties would call into question these methods in any war. Their use in Iraq is one of several reasons why it is so difficult for Washington and London to justify the invasion as a humanitarian intervention.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

The half-day trial, which took place under tight police security, was closed to journalists, diplomats and all of Nguyen’s relatives other than his wife. The U.S. State Department condemned the verdict, particularly since Nguyen appeared to have been targeted after submitting written testimony to the US Congressional Human Caucus and the Congressional Caucus on Vietnam. (New York) – The international community should protest the trial of a Vietnamese dissident on spying charges scheduled for December 31, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said today.  In a joint statement, the two human rights organizations called for Nguyen Vu Binh’s immediate and unconditional release.  According to Vietnamese sources, Nguyen Vu Binh – a 35-year-old journalist, writer and advocate of peaceful political reform – will be tried on spying charges on December 31. The case against him includes slandering the Vietnamese state for abuse of human rights in written testimony to the U.S. Congress in July 2002. Political trials of this kind in Vietnam routinely conclude in a matter of hours, without due process and with heavy jail sentences handed down to those convicted, decided in advance by the Vietnamese government. Under article 80 of Vietnam’s Penal Code, spying is punishable by 12 to 20 years’ imprisonment, a life sentence, or the death penalty. “Nguyen Vu Binh faces a summary trial and hefty jail term for speaking out against abuse,” said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director at Human Rights Watch.  “The U.S. Congress, which heard testimony from Binh last year, has a responsibility now to protest his case.” Binh, who received the prestigious Hellman/Hammett writers’ award in 2002, was a journalist at the official Communist Party of Vietnam journal, Communist Review (Tap Chi Cong San) for almost 10 years. In December 2000 he resigned from his post to attempt to form an independent political party – the Liberal Democratic Party. He was also one of several dissidents who attempted to form an Anti-Corruption Association in 2001. Binh was arrested on September 25, 2002 and has since been held in incommunicado detention. His wife and family members were refused access to him in prison. One month before his arrest, Binh criticized a controversial border treaty with China in an article entitled “Some Thoughts on the China-Vietnam Border Agreement,” which was distributed on the Internet.   “Vietnam should stop criminalizing free expression by arresting democracy activists on charges of spying and other vaguely-worded ‘national security’ crimes,’ said Daniel Alberman, Southeast Asia researcher from Amnesty International. “Nguyen Vu Binh has never advocated the use of violence.” Binh was earlier detained on July 20, 2002, when he was brought in for several days of questioning by the Public Security Ministry after he signed a group petition to the government and sent written testimony about human rights violations in Vietnam to a briefing sponsored by the Congressional Human Rights Caucus in Washington, D.C.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/24/indonesia-military-must-control-conduct-aceh","Indonesia- Military Must Control Conduct in Aceh","Indonesia: Military Must Control Conduct in Aceh","","12/24/2003","(New York) -- Indonesia must take public responsibility for abuses committed by its armed forces in Aceh, Human Rights Watch said today. An Indonesian former defense minister claimed that the soldiers’ actions were “beyond the control” of the country’s military. On December 17 Human Rights Watch published “Aceh Under Martial Law: Inside the Secret War,” which documented summary executions, “disappearances,” arbitrary arrests, beatings and other abuses against civilians by the Indonesian military. The Indonesian government, which renewed military operations in the northwestern province in May, summarily rejected these claims without any investigation. But the same day the report was released, Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom and a former minister of defense, said in a BBC interview: (To read the transcript of the interview, please see: https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/12/bbc-interview121703.htm) “Well, once you have soldiers on the ground who are facing terrorist organizations like GAM [Free Aceh Movement], there is no way that any commander can have immediate operational control on the troops on the ground and that goes also for the GAM forces.” “You cannot expect legal accountability in a war situation…. The precise rules of humanitarian law just go out of the window once the shooting starts.” “Ambassador Sudarsono should be commended for his candor in not denying the allegations in the Aceh report,” said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “But it is reprehensible to suggest that a military establishment cannot be expected to have control over their forces during armed conflict. This is the most basic responsibility of those in power.” Human Rights Watch is concerned that the former defense minister’s comments indicate that some in the Indonesian government and military do not understand Indonesia’s legal obligations during armed conflict, and therefore are not exercising appropriate control over the country’s armed forces. “Perhaps most worrisome is that Sudarsono comes from the more reform-minded wing of the Indonesian government,” said Adams. “His comments may reflect the thinking of others in positions of power in Indonesia.” Under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, a state assumes responsibility for the actions of its armed forces.  Armed forces must act to ensure the security of the civilian population and to limit harm to civilians and other non-combatants during military operations. States have a legal obligation to punish fairly and appropriately military personnel and others responsible for violations of the laws of war. “After their experience in East Timor, where many senior officers were indicted and convicted for failure to exercise proper control over their subordinates, Indonesia’s leaders should be under no illusions about their legal responsibilities in Aceh,” said Adams. Human Rights Watch expressed concern that a convicted human rights abuser in East Timor, Eurico Guterres, the former leader of the notorious Aitarak militia, recently announced that he now heads an organization with 18,000 members, 28 branch officers and the funds to fight separatists in Papua province. Guterres is free on bail while appealing a 10-year sentence in a Jakarta court for failure to exercise appropriate control over militia members who went on a murderous rampage after East Timor voted for independence in 1999.  Guterres claims that his organization is registered with the Indonesian government. “If Indonesia wants to prove that it is serious about exercising control over its armed forces and militias, it should act to remove Guterres and his forces from Papua before they commit abuses like those in East Timor,” said Adams. “This would be a sign that the government understands its responsibilities.” Human Rights Watch urged the Indonesian government to promptly and seriously investigate reports of human rights abuses in Aceh and make public any findings.  If it is unable to do so, it should permit the United Nations to send a fact-finding team to the province. Human Rights Watch welcomed reports that the Indonesian government is considering opening Aceh to outside observers. To address human rights concerns, however, such access must be complete and unfettered, except for legitimate security reasons. Indonesia claims that GAM is committing the same abuses as the Indonesian military, but without access, these claims cannot be investigated. “If there is nothing to hide, now is the time for Indonesia to let the world see what is happening in Aceh,” said Adams.","Asia, Indonesia",""

The international community is hopeful that a new charter for the country will pave the way for further democratization and stability. Yet pessimism may still be in order. The elections for delegates to the meeting earlier this fall were marred by vote buying, death threats and general intimidation. Many candidates told me in early December that the environment of fear kept them from even standing for election. Warlord proxies ran in large numbers. In some provinces, local warlords themselves were elected, despite rules preventing them from running. While some independent-minded people were elected, for the most part the process was dominated by the warlords and their allies. Even in Kabul there were problems, despite the presence of international peacekeepers, United Nations officials, and hundreds of journalists to help protect and monitor the elections. The Kabul regional elections resulted in the election of a feared mujahidin leader, Abdul Rabb al-Rasul Sayyaf, whose Ittihad-e Islami faction was involved in some of the worst fighting in Kabul 10 years ago when much of the city was destroyed. Municipal elections, held under a tent at the Gazi soccer stadium -- where the Taliban used to execute people -- were also flawed. Though the election site was guarded by Canadian and British peacekeeping troops and monitored by the U.N., many candidates complained about voter intimidation right at the site and a massive campaign to buy votes at $200 to $500 per person. U.N. officials even witnessed two workers from Kabul's dominant military-political faction, Shura-e Nazar, sitting at a table near the ballot box checking votes. As some voters approached the ballot box, they opened their voting card to show the two men, who then checked the voter's name on their list. The U.N. confiscated the list and banished the two men, but the votes were counted. There was also a scary collection of tufangdaran -- """"gunmen"""" in Dari -- walking about at the Kabul election site. I saw Arif Noori, the head of the fear-inspiring Afghan intelligence agency, the Amniat-e Melli, the Kabul city intelligence deputy chief, and a deputy minister of defense. Then there was Zalmay Tofan, a senior commander under Sayyaf who has been implicated in war crimes committed in the early 1990s. The mere presence of men like this creates an atmosphere of fear, since many Afghans know these men have been involved in abuses in the past. Although some courageous people stood up to the gunmen, blocks of votes for delegates to the loya jirga went to regional kingpins like Sayyaf, the western stongman Ismail Khan and the northern warlord General Rashid Dostum. The former president of Afghanistan and factional leader Burhanuddin Rabbani was also elected in the northeast, following a race in which one of his opponents received death threats. His faction picked up dozens of seats nationally. Most of these men now control blocks of votes at the loya jirga, and are using them both to advance their private agendas and to increase their political power. Worse still, the meeting now underway has been dominated by the warlords. Those with the guts to stand up to the gunmen have faced severe pressures. One woman delegate, Malalai Joya stood up and complained about the warlord dominance last week, but was almost thrown out of the convention and now requires full-time security guards. Needless to add, women's rights issues haven't been robustly debated at the meeting. Yet it probably wouldn't matter much if the meeting were going better. The sad truth is that the entire process has already been scripted to the end. President Hamid Karzai has been meeting with the warlords and trying to get their support for his draft of the constitution, which contains strong presidential powers and some human rights protections. And he will probably succeed. But while the constitution may create a strong presidency on paper and contain tepid human rights protections, it seems likely that Sayyaf and other warlords will ultimately emerge stronger at the end of the convention and continue their stranglehold on Afghan politics. Here, ultimately, is the real problem. The entire loya jirga process is oriented toward the status quo. Nothing in the draft constitution addresses Afghanistan's warlord-dominated power dynamic. All of the real decisions are still being made behind closed doors by men with guns. The United States, which has supplied weapons and cash to many warlords since 2001, doesn't seem to get it. Along with Mr. Karzai, U.S. officials are still emphasizing the constitution over a coherent strategy that marginalizes the warlords. The United States and other countries with influence, as well as the United Nations, must now redouble their efforts to sideline Afghanistan's dominant military factions and strengthen legitimate civic and political organizations, independent media, and human rights groups, so that future political processes, including next year's parliamentary and presidential elections, are more representative. Power brokering with repressive political kingpins is not the way forward. Instead, it is time to address Afghanistan's """"protection vacuum,"""" which has allowed local warlords to dominate this process. Sunday's announcement that the United States will deploy more small security units to the countryside was a welcome step, but additional expansion will be needed. Troops from other countries and many more U.N. human rights monitors should be deployed across the country, so that Afghans in trouble have someone to turn to other than a local gunman. The alternative is to allow warlordism and factionalism to run rampant. After 25 years of war, Afghans deserve better. --- John Sifton is the researcher on Afghanistan at Human Rights Watch.","Asia, Afghanistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/23/pakistan-release-french-journalists-pakistani-assistant","Pakistan- Release French Journalists Pakistani Assistant","Pakistan: Release French Journalists, Pakistani Assistant","","12/23/2003","(New York) -- The Pakistani government must immediately release two French journalists, Marc Epstein and Jean-Paul Guilloteau, and their Pakistani assistant, Khawar Mehdi Rizvi, who were arrested in Karachi on December 16, Human Rights Watch said today. The French journalists, who had press visas for Pakistan, have been charged with violating visa restrictions by visiting Quetta without having a special visa for the western border region with Afghanistan, where the city is located. Their assistant is likely to be charged with “sedition” since, as a Pakistani citizen, he cannot be charged or held for visa irregularities.  “These arrests and the possible criminal charges mark a new low in the growing assault on press freedoms in Pakistan,” said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “Foreign journalists have now fallen victim to the same tactics of intimidation and harassment that the Pakistani government often uses against the local press.”  Epstein and Guilloteau, who work for the French newsweekly L'Express, face up to three years in prison after their bail plea was rejected on December 20 amid reports that the Pakistani government was considering filing further charges against them, including “fabricating false evidence with a conspiracy to defame Pakistan.” The Pakistani government confirmed that it is examining “all possibilities.”  Rizvi, a local journalist who worked as a local assistant and interpreter for the French team, reportedly is being held secretly in Karachi and regularly “interrogated.”  In 2001 Epstein received the Diplomatic Press Prize for a report he and Rizvi produced on the situation in Pakistan's tribal areas. Rivzi has worked extensively with the French press, including Le Monde, Libération, TF1, France 2 and Arte.  Human Rights Watch pointed out that journalists have the right to freedom of movement to seek information, and it urged the Pakistani government to act in accordance with the Johannesburg Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to Information—standards drafted by international law and global rights experts in 1995 and endorsed by the United Nations special rapporteurs on freedom of expression and on the independence of judges and lawyers.  Johannesburg Principle 19, which addresses access to restricted areas, provides that, “governments may not prevent journalists from entering areas where there are reasonable grounds to believe that violations of human rights or humanitarian law are being, or have been, committed. Governments may not exclude journalists or representatives of such organizations from areas that are experiencing violence or armed conflict except where their presence would pose a clear risk to the safety of others.”  “If Pakistan were acting to protect the security of these journalists, it could simply have removed them from danger and then released them,” said Adams. “But the government’s clear purpose is to prevent journalists from reporting on politically sensitive topics. This is unacceptable.”  The arrests come in the wake of a domestic crackdown on the Pakistani press. Since General Pervez Musharraf's 1999 coup, the Pakistani government has systematically violated the fundamental rights of members of the press through threats, harassment and arbitrary arrests. Many have been detained without charge, mistreated and tortured, and otherwise denied basic due process rights. The government has sought to, and in several cases succeeded in, removing independent journalists from prominent publications. Meanwhile, the arrest of editors and reporters from local and regional newspapers on charges of sedition is becoming increasingly commonplace.  “General Musharraf should break with this pattern and demonstrate a commitment to genuine press freedom by releasing these three journalists and their Pakistani assistant and by ordering an end to government coercion and intimidation of the media,” said Adams.","Asia, Pakistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/22/try-saddam-credible-court","Try Saddam in a credible court","Try Saddam in a credible court","","12/22/2003","The capture of Saddam Hussein underscores the pressing need for a credible and legitimate tribunal where the former Iraqi president and other former high-level officials can be held accountable for the atrocities committed under their rule.  On Dec. 10, just days before Saddam’s capture, the Iraqi Governing Council made public a law establishing a domestic tribunal to try war crimes and crimes against humanity. The statute has a number of positive features, but regrettably it lacks essential elements to ensure that the planned trials of former government and Baath Party officials are fair and effective. The Governing Council should consider amending the law to address these flaws. The statute was drafted by a judicial commission set up by the council, working with advisers from the US-led Coalition Provisional Authority. Unfortunately, this process was not conducted in a transparent manner. The drafters did not consult widely among persons knowledgeable about international war crimes tribunals in the former Yugoslavia, Sierra Leone, or elsewhere, and they declined to issue a draft statute for public comment before issuing it in final form.  The most serious flaw in the statute is the insistence that only Iraqis serve as judges, prosecutors and investigating judges. The desire that Iraqis “own” this process is understandable and there are positive reasons for them to play a major role. But successfully prosecuting and convicting perpetrators of crimes against humanity is an extremely complex undertaking. Iraq’s justice system, where no trial has lasted for more than a few days, does not have that experience. The Iraqi judicial system, moreover, has been isolated for decades from important developments in international jurisprudence regarding crimes against humanity.  Iraqi leaders have asserted that “miles” of incriminating documents and hundreds of mass graves will make these prosecutions a simple matter. But establishing a political indictment of the former government is different from establishing a durable criminal indictment that can withstand the scrutiny of a trial run in accordance with international fair trial standards. Specific killings must be tied, by a chain of convincing evidence, to orders given by a particular commander.  What will be needed is a prosecutorial strategy that draws on earlier efforts in The Hague ­ not just what to do but also what not to do. The point is not to emulate every feature of the tribunals of Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia but to learn from them.  Marginalizing the international component will make this extremely difficult, if not impossible. A reportedly last-minute alteration in the law does allow for the possibility of recruiting non-Iraqi justices. The Iraqi authorities should take steps to make sure this international dimension is in fact built into the process from the start.  Elsewhere the law mandates the appointment of international experts to serve as advisers to the jurists, prosecutors and investigating judges who would make up the operative structure of the tribunal. Again, this recognizes the problem but does not address it.  Given the animus of the Bush administration to anything smacking of “international” justice, the lack of support from that quarter is unfortunate, though not surprising. But it is the Governing Council that has been most insistent that an Iraqi-led mechanism must in fact be solely Iraqi.  One reason for this appears to be an abiding distrust of the United Nations. Many Iraqis blame the world body for failing to address the crimes of Saddam Hussein’s regime while it was still in power. In this they are confusing the UN as an institution with the policies of the member states who determine politically what the organization can and cannot do ­ chief among them the permanent members of the Security Council.  While these Iraqi grievances are real, the blame is somewhat misplaced. Many members of the Governing Council have much experience in dealing with the international community and the UN, and they should take the lead in demystifying the issue. UN areas of competence in this domain are considerable given the role the organization has played in numerous post-conflict situations.  The dismal failure of the UN Security Council to establish a special international criminal tribunal on Iraq over the past many years should not now become a reason to keep the tribunal-in-formation from being the best it can be.  A second Iraqi motivation is a fear that an international tribunal would somehow be too “lenient.” In particular, there is Iraqi concern to preserve the sanction of the death penalty for the worst offenders, something that finds no precedent in the international tribunals of the 1990s. The task here is to persuade Iraqis of the solid reasons for the unmistakable de-legitimization of capital punishment worldwide, and that there are solid advantages in terms of credibility and legitimization with a tribunal possessing a significant international dimension that outweigh the possible political satisfactions of condemning certain ex-leaders to death.  A third reason, already noted, is the widespread notion that the evident criminality of the former Baath regime makes issues of a competent tribunal secondary, given that the verdict, in their minds, is a foregone conclusion. To continue to confuse political indictment with criminal prosecution will be to taint any proceedings against former Iraqi leaders. Such a development also risks compromising the future of the rule of law in Iraq and setting back the accomplishments to date in ensuring an international stake in seeing the worst offenders held to account.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/22/law-war-war-terror","The Law of War in the War on Terror","The Law of War in the War on Terror","","12/22/2003","The Bush administration has literalized its """"war"""" on terrorism, dissolving the legal boundaries between what a government can do in peacetime and what's allowed in war. This move may have made it easier for Washington to detain or kill suspects, but it has also threatened basic due process rights, thereby endangering us all. This language stretches the meaning of the word """"war."""" If Washington means """"war"""" metaphorically, as when it speaks about a """"war"""" on drugs, the rhetoric would be uncontroversial, a mere hortatory device intended to rally support for an important cause. Bush, however, seems to think of the war on terrorism quite literally -- as a real war -- and this concept has worrisome implications. The rules that bind governments are much looser during wartime than in times of peace. The Bush administration has used war rhetoric precisely to give itself the extraordinary powers enjoyed by a wartime government to detain or even kill suspects without trial. In the process, the administration may have made it easier for itself to detain or eliminate suspects. But it has also threatened the most basic due process rights. LAW AT PEACE, LAW AT WAR By literalizing its """"war"""" on terror, the Bush administration has broken down the distinction between what is permissible in times of peace and what can be condoned during a war. In peacetime, governments are bound by strict rules of law enforcement. Police can use lethal force only if necessary to meet an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. Once a suspect is detained, he or she must be charged and tried. These requirements -- what one can call """"law-enforcement rules"""" -- are codified in international human rights law. In times of war, law-enforcement rules are supplemented by a more permissive set of rules: namely, international humanitarian law, which governs conduct during armed conflict. Under such """"war rules,"""" unlike during peacetime, an enemy combatant can be shot without warning (unless he or she is incapacitated, in custody, or trying to surrender), regardless of any imminent threat. If a combatant is captured, he or she can be held in custody until the end of the conflict, without any trial. These two sets of rules have been well developed over the years, both by tradition and by detailed international conventions. There is little law, however, to explain exactly when one set of rules should apply instead of the other. For example, the Geneva Conventions -- the principal codification of war rules -- apply to """"armed conflict,"""" but the treaties do not define the term. Fortunately, in its commentary on them, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), the conventions' official custodian, has provided some guidance. One test that the ICRC suggests can help determine whether wartime or peacetime rules apply is to examine the intensity of hostilities in a given situation. The Bush administration, for example, has claimed that al Qaeda is at """"war"""" with the United States because of the magnitude of its attacks on September 11, 2001, its bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, its attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and the bombing of residential compounds in Saudi Arabia. Each of these attacks was certainly a serious crime warranting prosecution. But technically speaking, was the administration right to claim that they add up to a war? The ICRC's commentary does not provide a clear answer. In addition to the intensity of hostilities, the ICRC suggests considering factors such as the regularity of armed clashes and the degree to which opposing forces are organized. Whether a conflict is politically motivated also seems to play an unacknowledged role in deciding whether it is a """"war"""" or not. Thus organized crime or drug trafficking, although methodical and bloody, are generally understood to fall under law-enforcement rules, whereas armed rebellions, once sufficiently organized and violent, are usually seen as """"wars."""" The problem with these guidelines, however, is that they were written to address political conflicts rather than global terrorism. Thus they do not make it clear whether al Qaeda should be considered an organized criminal operation (which would not trigger the application of war rules) or a rebellion (which would). Even in the case of war, another factor in deciding whether law-enforcement or war rules should be applied is the nature of a given suspect's involvement. Such an approach can be useful because war rules treat as combatants only those who are taking an active part in hostilities. Typically, this category includes members of a military who have not laid down their arms as well as others who are fighting or approaching a battle, directing an attack, or defending a position. Under this rule, even civilians who pick up arms and start fighting can be considered combatants and treated accordingly. But this definition is difficult to apply to terrorism, where roles and activities are clandestine and a person's relationship to specific violent acts is often unclear. HARD CASES Given that so much confusion exists about whether to apply wartime or law-enforcement rules to a given situation, a better approach would be to make the decision based on its public policy implications. Unfortunately, the Bush administration seems to have ignored such concerns. Consider, for example, the cases of Jose Padilla and Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri. Federal officials arrested Padilla, a U.S. citizen, in May 2002 when he arrived from Pakistan at Chicago's O'Hare Airport, allegedly to scout out targets for a radiological (""""dirty"""") bomb. As for al-Marri, a student from Qatar, he was arrested in December 2001 at his home in Peoria, Illinois, for allegedly being a """"sleeper"""" agent: an inactive terrorist who, once activated, would help others launch attacks. President Bush, invoking war rules, has declared both men to be """"enemy combatants,"""" allowing the U.S. government to hold them without charge or trial until the end of the war against terrorism -- whenever that is. But should Padilla and al-Marri, even if they have actually done what the government claims, really be considered warriors? Aren't they more like ordinary criminals? A simple thought experiment shows how dangerous are the implications of treating them as combatants. The Bush administration has asserted that the two men planned to wage war against the United States and therefore can be considered de facto soldiers. But if that is the case, then under war rules, the two men could have been shot on sight, regardless of whether they posed any immediate danger to the United States (although they might have been spared under what is known as the doctrine of """"military necessity,"""" which holds that lethal force should not be used if an enemy combatant can be neutralized through lesser means). Under the administration's logic, then, Padilla could have been gunned down as he stepped off his plane at O'Hare, and al-Marri as he left his home in Peoria. That, after all, is what it means to be a combatant in time of war. But the Bush administration has not claimed that either suspect was anywhere near to carrying out his alleged terrorist plan. Neither man, therefore, posed the kind of imminent threat that would justify the use of lethal force under law-enforcement rules. Given this fact, it would have been deeply disturbing if they were shot as enemy soldiers. Of course, the White House has not proposed killing them; instead, it plans to detain the two men indefinitely. But if Padilla and al-Marri should not be considered enemy combatants for the purpose of killing them, they should not be considered enemy combatants for the purpose of detaining them, either. A similar classification problem, although with a possibly different result, arose in the case of Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi. Al-Harethi, who Washington alleges was a senior al Qaeda official, was killed by a drone-fired missile in November 2002 while driving in a remote tribal area of Yemen. Five of his companions, including a U.S. citizen, also died in the attack, which was carried out by the CIA. The Bush administration apparently considered al-Harethi to be an enemy combatant for his alleged involvement in the October 2000 U.S.S. Cole bombing. In this instance, the case for applying war rules was stronger than with Padilla or al-Marri (although the Bush administration never bothered to spell it out). Al-Harethi's mere participation in the 2000 attack on the Cole would not have made him a combatant in 2002, since he could have subsequently withdrawn from al Qaeda; war rules permit attacking only current combatants, not past ones. And if al-Harethi were a civilian, he could not have legally been attacked unless he was actively engaged in hostilities at the time. But the administration alleged that al-Harethi was a """"top bin Laden operative in Yemen,"""" implying that he was in the process of preparing future attacks. If true, this would have made the use of war rules against him more appropriate. And unlike in the cases of Padilla and al-Marri, arresting al-Harethi may not have been an option. The Yemeni government has little control over the tribal area where he was killed; indeed, 18 Yemeni soldiers had reportedly died in an earlier attempt to arrest him. Although there may have been a reasonable case for applying war rules to al-Harethi, the Bush administration has applied these rules with far less justification in other episodes outside the United States. For example, in October 2001, Washington sought the surrender of six Algerian men in Bosnia. At first, the U.S. government followed law-enforcement rules and secured the men's arrest. But then, after a three-month investigation, Bosnia's Supreme Court ordered the suspects released for lack of evidence. Instead of providing additional evidence, however, Washington simply switched to war rules. It pressured the Bosnian government to hand the men over anyway and whisked them out of the country -- not to trial, but to indefinite detention at the U.S. naval base at Guantánamo Bay. The administration followed a similar pattern in June 2003, when five al Qaeda suspects were detained in Malawi. Malawi's high court ordered local authorities to follow the law and either charge or release the five men, all of whom were foreigners. Ignoring local law, the Bush administration then insisted that the men be handed over to U.S. security forces instead. The five were spirited out of the country to an undisclosed location -- not for trial, but for interrogation. The move sparked riots in Malawi. The men were released a month later in Sudan, after questioning by Americans failed to turn up any incriminating evidence. A BAD EXAMPLE These cases are not anomalies. In the last two and a half years, the U.S. government has taken custody of a series of al Qaeda suspects in countries such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and Thailand. In many of these cases, the suspects were not captured on a traditional battlefield. Yet instead of allowing the men to be charged with a crime under local law-enforcement rules, Washington had them treated as combatants and delivered to a U.S. detention facility. There is something troubling about such a policy. Put simply, using war rules when law-enforcement rules could reasonably be followed is dangerous. Errors, common enough in ordinary criminal investigations, are all the more likely when a government relies on the kind of murky intelligence that drives many terrorist investigations. If law-enforcement rules are used, a mistaken arrest can be rectified at trial. But if war rules apply, the government is never obliged to prove a suspect's guilt. Instead, a supposed terrorist can be held for however long it takes to win the """"war"""" against terrorism. And the consequences of error are even graver if the supposed combatant is killed, as was al-Harethi. Such mistakes are an inevitable hazard of the battlefield, where quick life-and-death decisions must be made. But when there is no such urgency, prudence and humanity dictate applying law-enforcement standards. Washington must also remember that its conduct sets an example for governments around the world. After all, many other states would be all too eager to find an excuse to eliminate their enemies through war rules. Israel, to name one, has used this rationale to justify its assassination of terrorist suspects in Gaza and the West Bank. It is not hard to imagine Russia doing the same to Chechen leaders in Europe, Turkey using a similar pretext against Kurds in Iraq, China against Uighurs in Central Asia, or Egypt against Islamists at home. Moreover, the Bush administration should recognize that international human rights law is not indifferent to the needs of a government facing a security crisis. Criminal trials risk disclosure of sensitive information, as the administration has discovered in prosecuting Zacarias Moussaoui. But under a concept known as """"derogation,"""" governments are permitted to suspend certain rights temporarily when they can show that it is necessary to meet a """"public emergency threatening the life of the nation."""" The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which the United States has ratified, requires governments seeking derogation to file a declaration justifying the move with the un secretary-general. Among the many governments to have done so are Algeria, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Poland, Russia, Sri Lanka, and the United Kingdom. Yet the United States, determined to avoid the formal scrutiny involved, has not bothered. The Justice Department has defended the administration's use of war rules by citing a U.S. Supreme Court decision from World War II, Ex Parte Quirin. In that case, the Court ruled that German army saboteurs who landed in the United States could be tried as enemy combatants before military commissions. The Court distinguished its ruling from an earlier Civil War-era case, Ex Parte Milligan, which held that a civilian resident of Indiana could not be tried in military court because local civil courts remained open and operational. Noting that the German saboteurs had entered the United States wearing at least parts of their uniforms, the Court in Quirin held that the Milligan protections applied only to people who are not members of an enemy's armed forces. There are several reasons, however, why Quirin does not justify the Bush administration's broad use of war rules. First, the saboteurs in Quirin were agents of a government -- Germany's -- with which the United States was obviously at war. Whether the United States is actually at """"war"""" with al Qaeda, however, remains uncertain under the law. Second, although the Court in Quirin defined a combatant as anyone operating with hostile intent behind military lines, the case has arguably been superseded by the 1949 Geneva Conventions (ratified by the United States), which, as noted above, rule that people are combatants only if they either are members of an enemy's armed force or are taking active part in hostilities. Quirin thus does not help determine whether, under current law, people such as Padilla and al-Marri should be considered civilians (who, under Milligan, must be brought before civil courts) or combatants (who can face military treatment). Moreover, Quirin only establishes who can be tried before a military tribunal. The Bush administration, however, has asserted that it has the right to hold Padilla, al-Marri, and other detained """"combatants"""" without a trial of any kind -- in effect, precluding serious independent assessment of the grounds for potentially lifelong detention. Finally, whereas the government in Quirin was operating under a specific grant of authority from Congress, the Bush administration has acted on its own in taking the difficult decision to treat Padilla and al-Marri as combatants, without allowing the popular input that a legislative debate would provide. STAY SAFE The United States should not lightly suspend due process rights, as the Bush administration has done with its """"enemy combatants"""" -- particularly when a mistake could result in death or lengthy detention without charge or trial. Law-enforcement rules should presumptively apply to all suspects in the """"war"""" on terror, and the burden should fall on those who want to invoke war rules to demonstrate that they are necessary and appropriate. The best way to determine if war rules should apply would be through a three-part test. To invoke war rules, Washington should have to prove, first, that an organized group is directing repeated acts of violence against the United States, its citizens, or its interests with sufficient intensity that it can be fairly recognized as an armed conflict; second, that the suspect is an active member of an opposing armed force or is an active participant in the violence; and, third, that law enforcement means are unavailable. Within the United States, the third requirement would be nearly impossible to satisfy -- as it should be. Given the ambiguities of terrorism, we should be guided more by Milligan's affirmation of the rule of law than by Quirin's exception to it. Outside the United States, Washington should never resort to war rules away from a traditional battlefield if local authorities can and are willing to arrest and deliver a suspect to an independent tribunal -- regardless of how the tribunal then rules. War rules should be used in such cases only when no law-enforcement system exists (and the other conditions of war are present), not when the rule of law happens to produce inconvenient results. Even if military forces are used to make an arrest in such cases, law-enforcement rules can still apply; only when attempting an arrest is too dangerous should war rules be countenanced. This approach would recognize that war rules have their place -- but that, given the way they inherently compromise fundamental rights, they should be used sparingly. Away from a traditional battlefield, they should be used, even against a warlike enemy, as a tool of last resort -- when there is no reasonable alternative, not when a functioning criminal justice system is available. Until there are better guidelines on when to apply war and law-enforcement rules, this three-part test, drawn from the policy consequences of the decision, offers the best way to balance security and civil rights. In the meantime, the Bush administration should abandon its excessive use of war rules. In attempting to make Americans safer, it has made all Americans, and everyone else, less free.","United States",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/21/bolivia-letter-president-carlos-mesa-gisbert","Bolivia- Letter to President Carlos Mesa Gisbert","Bolivia: Letter to President Carlos Mesa Gisbert","","12/21/2003","Dear President Mesa: I write respectfully to draw your attention to serious obstacles to the ongoing investigation of the killings of more than fifty Bolivians in protests that took place in September and October of this year.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that if these problems are not resolved in an expeditious way the investigation will end unsuccessfully. I write respectfully to draw your attention to serious obstacles to the ongoing investigation of the killings of more than fifty Bolivians in protests that took place in September and October of this year.  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that if these problems are not resolved in an expeditious way the investigation will end unsuccessfully. In your inaugural address to the National Congress on October 17 you undertook to ensure that the Bolivian justice system would carry out an independent and impartial investigation into the tragic events of the preceding weeks.  At the same time you acknowledged that the task would be complex and difficult. Now that two months have passed since you made your address, it is a good moment to examine those difficulties dispassionately. In our view, to achieve justice, Bolivia’s civilian courts must retain jurisdiction over the investigation and prosecution of members of the armed forces suspected of committing abuses when quelling protests and civil unrest.  In addition, robust measures must be taken to strengthen the independence and effectiveness of the civilian justice system. We recall the conclusion of the Secretary General of the Organization of American States in his Report on the Events of February 2003 in Bolivia, that “a program to strengthen justice and the Public Ministry in particular is an absolute priority in Bolivia.” A Human Rights Watch representative visited La Paz between November 23 and November 30 to discuss the investigation of the September and October killings with officials of your government.  He met with the minister of government and the vice-minister of justice, as well as with members of the attorney general’s office (Fiscalía General de la Nación) and representatives of the armed forces and the military courts. He also met with the chair of the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies, officials of the human rights ombudsman’s office, members of nongovernmental human rights organizations, and relatives of those killed or wounded in the protests. Besides gathering information on the steps being taken to investigate the recent violence, he also looked into the ongoing investigation of killings that took place on February 12 and 13, 2003, when thirty-one people (sixteen civilians, ten police, and five soldiers) died during and after a riot in La Paz by members of the Bolivian police. The September and October deaths occurred in the context of anti-government protests sparked by plans to sell Bolivian natural gas through Chile.  On September 20 three campesinos and an eight-year-old girl were killed by gunfire during a clash between armed protesters and army troops and police at Warisata, after the army intervened to ensure the safe passage of hundreds of tourists prevented by protesters from leaving Sorata. Two army conscripts also died in the exchange of fire. On October 12, at least twenty-six civilians were killed in El Alto. Many of them were shot when army troops armed with military combat rifles tried to break blockades preventing the passage of fuel tankers from El Alto to La Paz. At least fourteen civilians were shot and killed on the following day as the protests continued in La Paz.  Given the high ratio of civilian to military and police casualties, Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that the security forces may have failed to exercise proper care in responding to the protests. Under binding international standards, the intentional use of lethal force by law enforcement officials is permissible only when strictly unavoidable to protect life. Such standards require that impartial and independent investigations be carried out where there are indications that this principle was not followed or ignored. In all, the Human Rights Ombudsman counted a total of fifty-nine deaths during street protests between September 20 and October 19, mainly in Warisata, El Alto, and La Paz.  Other nongovernmental human rights groups, such as the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights, estimated the number of deaths at over eighty. Forty-nine civilians died from gunshot wounds, and more than 400 people were hospitalized with injuries.  Three army conscripts also died. A prosecutor investigating the incidents told us that high caliber munitions used exclusively by the armed forces claimed the lives of most of the civilian victims.  Prosecutors attached to the district attorney’s office for La Paz (Fiscalia del Distrito de La Paz) are conducting investigations into both the killings that took place in February 2003 and those of September and October. Unfortunately, several serious obstacles are hampering their work. Military Jurisdiction and Lack of Military Cooperation with Civilian Justice Officials We are deeply concerned that the armed forces have failed to cooperate fully with the attorney general’s office. Officials of the office informed Human Rights Watch that the army had still not responded to requests for information made by the public prosecutor six weeks ago.  In those requests, the prosecutor asked for information about the units dispatched to quell the October protests, including the names of their commanding officers. Nor has information been forthcoming about an army helicopter that flew over El Alto at the height of the October protests and from which soldiers are believed to have fired on the crowd.  According to these sources, rather than provide the information requested by the prosecutor regarding the soldiers killed, the army is carrying out a separate investigation into the circumstances of their deaths.  Judging from past investigations into civilian deaths during protests, it is likely that if the civilian investigation advances and charges are brought against military personnel, the army will assert a competing claim for jurisdiction over the case. The president of the Supreme Tribunal of Military Justice, Gen. Jorge Rodríguez Bravo, stressed to Human Rights Watch that civilian courts lacked jurisdiction to prosecute a soldier for any crime committed while on active service. He also explained that military courts would normally dismiss charges against a soldier responsible for a civilian death who was obeying orders.  When the military courts obtain jurisdiction over a case involving members of the armed forces implicated in abuses against civilians, the case almost inevitably ends in an acquittal.  The military’s ruling of acquittal, moreover, blocks the civilian justice system from proceeding with its own prosecution. The negative effects of military justice can be seen in several recent cases.  In August 2003, for example, the Supreme Military Tribunal acquitted Cap. Robinson Iriarte Lafuente, an army marksman whom the public prosecutor had accused of the homicide of a seventeen-year-old during April 2000 protests in Cochabamba. After his acquittal, Iriarte was promoted to the rank of major. The Superior Court of Justice had ruled in February 2001 that the case fell under military jurisdiction because Iriarte was on active duty and under orders at the time, even though he was in civilian clothes. Another case in which a civilian prosecutor’s investigation was preempted by a suspect’s rapid acquittal by a military court was that of Col. Aurelio Burgos Blacutt, accused of killing a protestor in January 2002.  After Burgos was acquitted in the military courts later in the year the attorney general’s office had no choice but to drop the charges against him. Most recently, the army has insisted on retaining jurisdiction over the case of four soldiers accused of killing a nurse and a porter in La Paz on February 13, 2003, during the unrest that followed the police riot. On October 4, the Superior District Court of La Paz transferred the case to a military tribunal.  In doing so, it reversed an August court ruling that had confirmed the jurisdiction of the civilian courts. By insisting on conducting criminal investigations in parallel with civilian prosecutors, the military justice authorities obstruct accountability. The pursuit of a single case within two separate jurisdictions violates article 45 of Bolivia’s Code of Penal Procedures, which states: “different trials may not be held in respect of a single event, even if the accused are different.” Most importantly, the defendant’s acquittal in a military tribunal bars further proceedings in the civilian courts, in application of the principle of non bis en idem, or double jeopardy.  Human Rights Watch opposes the use of military tribunals try those responsible for human rights abuses committed in the course of military operations, or outside them. We do not believe that military courts enjoy sufficient independence to render impartial verdicts in such cases, and we fear that the predictable result is impunity. Moreover, we note that in Bolivia there is no civilian court review of the verdicts of the military courts. International human rights bodies have consistently called on states to transfer jurisdiction over human rights cases from military to civilian authorities. The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which monitors states’ compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, has repeatedly called on states parties to subject military personnel alleged to have committed human rights violations to civilian jurisdiction. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has found that “when the State permits investigations to be conducted by the entities with possible involvement, independence and impartiality are clearly compromised.” The result is “de facto impunity,” which has a corrosive effect on the rule of law and violates the principles of the American Convention on Human Rights, of which Bolivia is a State Party. Given the large number of deaths at issue in the incidents mentioned, it is crucial that the civilian justice system be allowed to carry out a full and impartial investigation.  I would therefore urge you to instruct military officials to cooperate fully with civilian prosecutors, and to order military prosecutors to desist from conducting a separate and competing investigation into the events.  As a longer term measure, I would urge you to introduce legislation to limit the jurisdiction of military courts to military offenses in which civilians are not victims, thus ensuring that the civilian justice system retains jurisdiction in cases involving human rights abuses or the excessive use of lethal force. Weaknesses of the Civilian Justice System: Inefficiency, Vulnerability to Political Influence, and Lack of Resources Although we believe that it is critical that the investigation of the September and October killings remain in the hands of civilian officials, Human Rights Watch is also deeply concerned about chronic weaknesses in the civilian justice system. We emphasize that measures to limit the scope of military justice must be accompanied by vigorous steps to improve the performance and functioning of the Public Ministry.  Officials of the Public Ministry are vulnerable to political pressure and are seen as lacking the independence that is so vital to their function.  To begin with, all nine of Bolivia’s district attorneys enjoy only a provisional status -- as opposed to the normal fixed, five-year tenure in office--inevitably affecting their independence.  Some prosecutors are, moreover, viewed as inept and under-qualified for their tasks.  Indeed, during our visit to La Paz we were struck by the low opinion that many people expressed about the efficiency and credibility of the Public Ministry. According to recent press reports, one out of four public prosecutors in Bolivia is under investigation for having committed irregularities, and the great majority remain in their posts. For their part, those prosecutors who try hard to do a professional job encounter numerous obstacles and frustrations. The Public Ministry’s record over the last two decades is extremely troubling. Since 1985 there have been more than 300 deaths in protests or situations of violence arising from social conflicts; thousands have been wounded or illegally detained, and many have allegedly been tortured. Yet Bolivian human rights groups we consulted only knew of one case in which a law enforcement officer or members of the armed forces was convicted for a human rights abuse: the sentencing in November 2003 of three policemen to prison, one of them for ten years, for burning to death a Peruvian detainee, Freddy Cano López, in May 1999. Proposals by the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies that special parliamentary commissions take charge of criminal investigations into alleged abuses by the security forces during protests are an indication of a lack of confidence in the work of the Public Ministry. For example, the Human Rights Commission recommended this step following its investigation of the death of nine civilians and a police officer during a clash between miners and security forces in northern Potosí in December 1996.  Members of the Human Rights Commission and of the office of the Human Rights Ombudsman told Human Rights Watch that they believed that a parliamentary commission should be put in charge of investigating the September and October deaths.  Some of the weaknesses of the Public Ministry can be ascribed to the fact that it is under-resourced.  Unfortunately, this lack of funding is evident in the current investigation.  Dr. César Fiorini, the general secretary of the attorney general’s office (Secretario General de la Fiscalía Nacional), informed Human Rights Watch that his office has requested a special treasury allocation of 2 million Bolivianos (approximately $250,000) to cover the costs of investigating the September and October deaths. While his office awaits a decision on that request, the investigation has been hanging by a financial shoestring; it has had to get by with 7,000 Bolivianos (less than $1,000), scraped together with difficulty from the attorney general’s existing budget, an amount quite insufficient for an investigation of this scope and complexity. Prosecutors conducting the investigation told us of the urgent need for funds to cover costs of transportation, fuel, supplies, and equipment.  One said that he had had to the meet the costs of a mission out of his own pocket. From our conversations with justice officials, it is clear that the attorney general’s office does not have sufficient funds to undertake these investigations without additional financial assistance. We note with concern that an allocation of 1 million Bolivianos approved by the Senate to cover the costs of the attorney general’s investigation of the February 2003 deaths has still not been made available. This situation should be rectified a soon as possible, and sufficient funds made available to cover the essential requirements of both investigations. Improving the Public Ministry’s record will depend in part on providing it with adequate funds to enable it to operate effectively. Yet it is clear that economic difficulties are only part of the problem, and possibly not the most serious part.  What is equally or even more important is to ensure that the Public Ministry can count on qualified staff  who are insulated from undue political pressures.  New incumbents should be appointed as soon as possible and such appointments must be based solely on professional criteria.  To date, Congress has been unwilling either to appoint Public Ministry officials to their proper term in office, or to provide the Public Ministry with the funds it needs to carry out its functions. I therefore ask you to impress upon members of Congress the need to address the serious problems of the Public Ministry as a matter or urgency. Given the difficulties that surround the investigation being undertaken by the Public Ministry, I believe that you should give serious consideration to the formation of an independent commission charged with investigating the incidents of September and October. The Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions contemplate the formation of an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure when the established investigative procedures face difficulties such as lack of expertise and impartiality, or do not enjoy the confidence of families of the victims. Members of such a commission should be chosen for their recognized impartiality, competence, and independence as individuals. In particular, they should be independent of any institution, agency or person that might be the subject of the inquiry. The commission should have the authority to obtain all information necessary to the inquiry and should conduct the inquiry as provided for under these principles. Investigation into Responsibility of Former Civilian Authorities Finally, Human Rights Watch supports in principle the investigation recommended by the attorney general on November 22 into the possible responsibility of former president Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada and members of his cabinet for ordering the military operations that led to the September and October deaths.  If Congress votes to allow a “trial of responsibilities,” it is of fundamental importance that the proceedings be conducted with scrupulous regard for due process guarantees in order to safeguard the integrity and credibility of this investigation. It should also enjoy the full cooperation of the armed forces, the police, officials of the former government and those civilian witnesses able to cast light on the circumstances in which so many people died. A fair and impartial judicial investigation of the events of September and October is of vital importance. If the Bolivian courts are able to establish the truth about what occurred and clarify the responsibility of the authorities for this tragic loss of life, it will help to strengthen the rule of law and consolidate Bolivia’s democratic institutions.

The recent political agreement between the major parties in Burundi’s ten-year civil war should not have granted immunity from prosecution for such blatant and widespread crimes, Human Rights Watch said. The 63-page report, “Everyday Victims: Civilians in the Burundian War,” documents massacres and rapes of civilians and attacks on civilian property between April and November, when the government and the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), the main rebel group signed an peace accord guaranteeing all sides provisional immunity from prosecution for war crimes. “Agreements based on immunity from prosecution rarely work,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division. “The kinds of abuses described in this report should not go unpunished.” One example documented in the report: during combat in April with Hutu rebel forces near the Burundian capital Bujumbura, the Tutsi-dominated military deliberately killed scores of civilians at Kabezi. In September the military committed similar killings at Muyira and Ruziba. Meanwhile, during that same period, combatants of the main armed opposition groups—the FDD and the National Liberation Forces (FNL)—have killed scores of civilians and pillaged their property. Both government soldiers and rebel combatants have raped women and girls, a crime committed with increasing frequency in the capital and surrounding areas in Burundi. In addition, rebel groups have abducted children for use as combatants. United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has acclaimed the agreement, as have other international leaders, including South Africa’s deputy president, Jacob Zuma, who helped to broker the accord. But the international community has failed to condemn the guarantee of provisional immunity to combatants who have committed war crimes. Proponents of the peace deal have argued that the immunity clauses were necessary to bring as many parties as possible to the negotiating table. But peace agreements based on ignoring atrocities in the past very rarely succeed, Human Rights Watch said. The 1999 Lomé Accord that was supposed to end the civil war in Sierra Leone is one obvious example. “With the recent agreements, government soldiers and FDD combatants have no need to fear being held accountable for their conduct,” said Des Forges. “Civilians pay and will continue to pay the price.” The FNL, a smaller rebel movement, has refused to negotiate with the government, and combat continues in and around the capital as government forces, which now sometimes incorporate current FDD members, fight FNL combatants. Civilians have left the Kinama and Kamenge sections of Bujumbura, and tens of thousands have fled their homes in the surrounding hills—sometimes repeatedly—in search of security.

It was the fourth such incident in the country this year. On December 9, relatives buried Kamalodin Jumaniazov, whose body they had received from police custody two days earlier. Witnesses who viewed the body told Human Rights Watch that it had two bloody injuries on the forehead, bruising on the nape of the neck, and a grazed knee. Photographs shown to Human Rights Watch confirm these injuries. News of the death came as many await the Uzbek government’s release of a promised national plan of action to combat torture. “The Uzbek government must conduct a thorough and independent investigation into this death,” said Rachel Denber, acting director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “The government claims to be taking steps to combat torture, but once again the reality of the situation sadly shows otherwise.” Police in a village in Karakalpakstan, in western Uzbekistan, arrested Jumaniazov, a 25-year old father of two, on November 29 on suspicion of theft. The prosecutor’s office on December 1 issued an arrest warrant, accusing him of marijuana use. On December 7, after hearing rumors of Jumaniazov’s death, his family went to the police station, where they were told to go to the morgue. At the morgue, officials showed them Jumaniazov’s already frozen body. He had apparently died at least 15 hours earlier. The next day, when the family was preparing the corpse for burial, they noticed the injuries on the body and called various law enforcement offices. A prosecutor from the Turkul district prosecutor’s office told Jumaniazov’s relatives that he had committed suicide by hanging himself in his cell with a sweater. Those who saw the body said that the throat had been cut in the autopsy and that injuries to the front of the neck were therefore not visible. The forearms of the corpse also had cuts across them, but a doctor told the family that it appeared that these had been made after Jumaniazov’s death. On December 8, the family demanded that a forensic expert examine the body. The prosecutor’s office brought in two experts who orally confirmed to family members that Jumaniazov had suffered from head trauma. The experts refused to put their findings in writing, however, and representatives from the prosecutor’s office prohibited Jumaniazov’s relatives from recording the experts or the body on video. According to Jumaniazov’s family members, authorities have not opened an investigation into his death.   “Uzbekistan has a poor record on holding torturers accountable. Let’s hope that this case will be the exception,” said Denber. “The government should finally take on this issue, and prove that all its talk of reform has some substance.” In Bukhara, Human Rights Watch recently documented another suspicious death in custody. On August 1 police in Bukhara province detained Nodirjon Zamonov, 20, on suspicion of theft. When his father went to the police station that afternoon, he saw his son terrified and crying. His father left the police station at approximately 2 p.m. An hour later, the family found their son dead on the floor of their cowshed, with his neck encircled by a rope that did not belong to the family, and with bruises and other wounds on his body. The Bukhara police are in possession of a handwritten letter of confession for the theft, allegedly signed by Zamonov, although the family stated that the handwriting is not his. Police claim that Zamonov hanged himself. However, the family said that although there was a rope hanging over Zamonov’s body when they found him, he was not hanging. Photographic evidence and the family members’ description of the throat injury appear to be inconsistent with suicide by hanging. The prosecutor’s office opened an investigation into Zamonov’s death, but soon closed it, stating that there was no evidence of a crime. The death certificate stated that the cause of death was unknown. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture visited the country at the end of 2002 and in April issued a report finding that torture was systematic in Uzbekistan. Earlier this year the Uzbek government drafted a national action plan to implement the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations to combat torture. International interlocutors in this process expected a final draft of the plan by mid-November, but the government has not yet issued it.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

On December 18, a Shanghai appeals court upheld the three-year sentence of lawyer Zheng Enchong on charges of circulating state secrets. Zheng had sent information advocating the rights of evicted tenants to an international human rights group.   “Even the official People’s Daily criticizes judicial mistreatment of evicted tenants and calls for their rights to be protected,” said Sara Davis, researcher for China at Human Rights Watch. “Why is Mr. Zheng in jail for saying the same thing?” Zheng Enchong was representing residents facing evictions as part of an urban redevelopment project in one Shanghai neighborhood. Police reportedly arrested 85 of the residents who attempted to petition Beijing. Zheng himself was arrested in June after faxing Chinese news reports about the cases and local labor protests to Human Rights in China. Zheng apparently became a target of local officials after filing a suit alleging corruption between developers and officials.  On October 28, Zheng was sentenced to three years in prison for “illegally providing state secrets to a foreign organization.” A Shanghai appeals court this week upheld the sentence. Human Rights Watch said Zheng should be released immediately.   Article 2 of China’s Protection of State Secrets Law (Baoshou guojia mimi fa) lists seven categories of state secrets, including matters having to do with national construction projects and military strength. “The Shanghai developers are building condos, not airfields,” said Davis. “Local courts are using the state secrets law to protect local business interests. Beijing should intervene to stop this misuse of the law.” As China continues its rapid development, forced evictions by developers are on the rise around the country. Tenant protestors often complain of low compensation for their homes, lack of due process, and lack of legal recourse. As protests have grown around the country, even state-run media have weighed in with editorials calling for legal reform, openness and for investigations into local corruption.   Official statistics show that 850,000 households and 2,500,000 residents were relocated in Shanghai during the past decade. Since 2000, at least 80,000 Shanghai households have been relocated every year for renovations to the old city district. A report by the Southern Daily newspaper also says that the majority of demolition companies in Shanghai are connected with government-owned businesses.","Asia, China and Tibet",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/18/end-cycle-abuse-aceh","End the Cycle of Abuse in Aceh","End the Cycle of Abuse in Aceh","","12/18/2003","JAKARTA -- Indonesia's northern Sumatran province of Aceh should be an investor and tourist paradise. The nearby island of Pulau Weh offers pristine beaches, beautiful coral reefs, and great seafood. The capital, Banda Aceh, is a friendly city where well-educated young men and women eagerly strike up conversations with visitors outside the main mosque. The suburbs seem to be straight out of a Hollywood set, with streets of single-family homes fronted by neatly manicured lawns and driveways. Indeed, the latest Hollywood fluff can be seen at the local multiplex -- the top hangout for """"cool"""" teens. But paradise is on a losing streak. These days the beaches are devoid of tourists, and in many parts of the province the only education on offer is a crash course in survival. Since May, Aceh has been burning -- with more than 500 schools torched by unknown arsonists. This followed Indonesia's President Megawati Sukarnoputri ending of a six-month ceasefire, declaration of martial law, and unleashing of the Indonesian armed forces against the armed, separatist Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, or GAM). While the world has watched the war in Iraq on TV, the conflict in Aceh has been largely hidden. The Indonesian government has kept the province almost entirely closed to foreign journalists, human-rights monitors, and even humanitarian aid workers. While the government reports that more than 1,100 GAM fighters and some 100 Indonesian soldiers have been killed, there is no way to verify these figures. The Indonesian government also reports more than 300 civilian deaths since May. But recent interviews with Acehnese refugees in Malaysia indicate that the true figure may be higher. Of 85 Acehnese interviewed, seven had directly witnessed a summary execution of a civilian by Indonesian security forces. Three had discovered bodies of civilians -- in two cases family members -- in close proximity to military operations. Several others described abductions leading to deaths. Others told of beatings, arbitrary arrests, and drastic limits on freedom of movement. All interviewees had a story of abuse to tell. Jakarta's approach of relying on the military, instead of using other means to try to bring the conflict to an end, has resulted in a new wave of rights violations. In many cases, Indonesian security forces have been described as routinely resorting to violence against primarily young Acehnese men, who had been stopped for questioning. One man described the death of a young man named Jamal: """"At first I just saw three soldiers, but then others joined in. I saw one of the soldiers handcuff the ankles of this man, and then another soldier held him by his feet and swung him against a tree. The soldier did this many times so that the man's head was hitting the tree. His brains were coming out of his head, until he was dead. And then the corpse was put on the street and another soldier shot many times into the corpse."""" Tens of thousands of Acehnese civilians have been forced to flee their homes to escape the conflict or to seek food and shelter. Residents who remain in their homes are subject to shortages of food, water, and sanitation, and breakdowns in basic services such as health care and education. Many refugees explained that they left because they did not have enough food to eat. Senior Indonesian military officials vowed to """"crush"""" GAM within six months of ending the ceasefire in May. But they failed, and in November renewed martial law for a further six months. The comments earlier this month of police Brigadier General Guliansyah, head of law enforcement operations for the Aceh police force, are a chilling example of the kind of incendiary talk that can lead to abuses and the failure of the armed forces to distinguish between GAM combatants and civilians: """"If necessary shoot on the spot anyone who raises this GAM flag. Whoever raises the flag must be a GAM member."""" It is time for the Indonesian government -- and its foreign supporters -- to ensure that its military, which has a well-documented and shameful history of abuse in East Timor, Papua and Aceh, respects international human rights and humanitarian law and establishes credible processes to remove, discipline, and prosecute soldiers who commit abuses. To show good faith and maintain its good standing with the international community, it should immediately allow an independent commission to investigate allegations of human-rights violations and report findings publicly. War is violent, bloody and dangerous, but never more so than when it is waged in secret. To discourage further violations, it is time for Indonesia to allow independent and impartial observers and humanitarian agencies to have immediate and unfettered access to Aceh. The almost hermetic seal that Indonesia has placed on Aceh's villages and mountains may be encouraging military forces on both sides to believe that, as in the past, they can commit abuses with impunity. The international community, particularly the quartet of the United States, European Union, Japan and the World Bank -- which were previously involved in peace negotiations between Indonesia and GAM -- must now put maximum pressure on Indonesia to ensure the well-being and safety of the civilian population. While many diplomats in Indonesia have worked hard to encourage both sides to end the violence and return to the negotiating table -- last week donor governments reportedly asked the government to find a peaceful solution -- there has been little sense of urgency in key capitals like Washington, Tokyo, Brussels and Canberra. Instead, they seem to have been mesmerized by the desire to support Indonesia's domestic war on terror after the bombings in Bali and Jakarta, and as a result have looked the other way as the Indonesian government prosecutes its war in Aceh. It is in the best interests of Indonesia and its friends to ensure that the long cycle of abuse in Aceh comes to a rapid end. Creating a new generation of victims only increases the chances that the Acehnese independence movement will grow and that the world's largest Muslim country may slip into an unpredictable round of instability.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/18/indonesia-refugees-reveal-widespread-abuses-aceh","Indonesia- Refugees Reveal Widespread Abuses in Aceh","Indonesia: Refugees Reveal Widespread Abuses in Aceh","","12/18/2003","(Jakarta)—The Indonesian military in Aceh is pursuing a campaign of killings, “disappearances” and beatings of civilians, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Acehnese refugees interviewed in Malaysia revealed widespread abuses in the Indonesian province, which has been effectively closed to observers since martial law was imposed in May. The Indonesian government must take immediate measures to stop these serious human rights violations in Aceh. The province should immediately be opened to independent international and national observers, journalists, and humanitarian agencies, both as a deterrent to further abuses and to provide much needed humanitarian assistance to civilians affected by the war.  The 50-page report, """"Aceh Under Martial Law: Inside the Secret War,"""" documents violations of human rights and humanitarian law since the Indonesian government imposed martial law in Aceh on May 19 and renewed military operations against the armed, separatist Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, or GAM). Based on testimony from Acehnese refugees in Malaysia, the report documents the role of the Indonesian security forces in extrajudicial executions, forced disappearances, beatings, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and drastic limits on freedom of movement in Aceh.  “Every Acehnese we interviewed had a story of abuse to tell,” said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “We fear that the abuses we have uncovered against the civilian population may be just the tip of the iceberg.” Witnesses told Human Rights Watch about village sweeps in which civilians were killed, some while being questioned or detained, others while fleeing in fear of mistreatment. Victims and witnesses recounted in shocking detail how Indonesian forces appear to be targeting young men in Aceh.  “I saw one of the soldiers handcuff the ankles of this man, and then another soldier held him by his feet and swung him against a tree,” one young Acehnese man recounted. “The soldier did this many times so that the man’s head was hitting the tree. His brains were coming out of his head, until he was dead.” Human Rights Watch is concerned that many Indonesian military personnel seem to presume that all young men in Aceh are GAM fighters, and are targeting civilians indiscriminately.  “In case after case, soldiers have gone into Acehnese villages and publicly executed or beat people seemingly at random,” said Adams. “If the aim is to instill fear in the populace, sadly it’s working.” Human Rights Watch called on the Indonesian military to put an end to ongoing abuses and give the highest priority to ensuring that perpetrators of human rights violations among the armed forces are identified and brought to justice. Although token efforts have been made since the start of martial law in Aceh to hold soldiers accountable for human rights violations, the Indonesian government continues to have a dismal record in addressing abuses during past military campaigns in Aceh, East Timor and elsewhere in the archipelago. “It is time for the Indonesian military to take its responsibilities seriously to follow international law in its conduct of war,” said Adams. “Establishing accountability for human rights abuses in Aceh and ensuring that the perpetrators are brought to justice are essential if the decades-long conflict is to be resolved. It is also necessary if Indonesia is to regain credibility with the international community.” Although unable in its interviews with refugees in Malaysia to document abuses by GAM, Human Rights Watch remained concerned at possible abuses being committed by the armed separatist group. Human Rights Watch urged GAM to act in accordance with international humanitarian law, and called on the armed group to not take actions that place civilians at special risk, such as kidnappings, or confiscations of identity cards for use by GAM combatants.  Human Rights Watch welcomed the Indonesian government’s decision this month to allow access to Aceh by the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations humanitarian agencies. Human Rights Watch called on the government to go further by opening Aceh to independent monitoring, including by international organizations, and allowing Indonesia’s National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) and local human rights organizations to carry out fact-finding investigations.  Human Rights Watch urged the international community, in particular the “Quartet” (the United States, European Union, Japan and the World Bank), to more forcefully to register concern about a war that has taken place behind a veil of secrecy.  “It is time for the international community, led by the Quartet, to insist upon unfettered access for diplomats, journalists, human rights monitors and humanitarian aid agencies,” said Adams. “Aceh needs to be top priority in the international community’s dealings with the Indonesian government and should be raised at every meeting.” Human Rights Watch called on countries providing military assistance or training to Indonesia to consider a moratorium on all arms transfers to Indonesia. Military assistance should also be conditioned on clear progress in bringing to justice military and police responsible for current and past human rights violations. The current Indonesian military offensive in Aceh began on May 19 after a six-month ceasefire failed to resolve the longstanding conflict in the province. The Aceh offensive is Indonesia’s largest military campaign since the country’s invasion of East Timor in 1975. The operation involves an estimated 30,000 troops, who are opposed by an estimated 5,000 armed members of GAM.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Bush had designated an “enemy combatant,” is a welcome affirmation of the rule of law and the right to liberty, Human Rights Watch said today.   The Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit court today rejected the government’s contention that the president’s constitutional powers as commander-in-chief gave him the authority to detain a U.S. citizen captured on U.S. soil and far from any battlefield.   Human Rights Watch applauded the court’s decision as being consistent with international law. In the case of persons apprehended outside areas of armed conflict and having no direct connection to a conflict, the protections of international human rights law must apply in full and cannot be displaced by the laws of war. These protections include the rights to be formally charged and permitted access to counsel.   “The Padilla case involved the question of whether a U.S. citizen can be locked up, denied access to lawyers, and called an ‘enemy combatant,’ just on the president’s say-so,” said Jamie Fellner, director of the U.S. program at Human Rights Watch. “The court has ruled that the president can’t do that. It’s a huge rebuke of the Bush administration’s assertion of this unilateral power.”   Agents of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested Padilla on a material witness warrant on May 8, 2002, as he arrived at Chicago’s O’Hare Airport. He carried no arms or explosives. He was confined in a federal prison in New York, where he was given an attorney and allowed to consult with her.   On June 9, 2002, two days before a federal district court was to consider the motion filed by Padilla’s attorney to vacate the material witness warrant, President Bush issued an order designating Padilla as an enemy combatant and directing Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to take him into military custody. The government contended that Padilla met with members of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, developed a plan with them to build and detonate a “dirty bomb” in the United States, and had returned to the United States to further this plan.    For the past 18 months, the U.S. military has held Padilla in a high-security naval brig in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bush Administration has refused Padilla permission to communicate with his family, with counsel or with any non-military personnel. The U.S. Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit found that the president lacks authority under the Constitution to detain Padilla as an enemy combatant, given that Padilla is a U.S. citizen who had not been seized on a foreign battlefield or while actively engaged in armed conflict against the United States.   Moreover, federal legislation expressly forbids federal detention of any U.S. citizen in the United States without congressional authorization. Congress passed this statute in 1971 in a deliberate effort to prevent any repetition of the detention of U.S. citizens as had occurred with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. Congress has not authorized President Bush to detain militarily U.S. citizens apprehended in the United States. “If the U.S. government believes Padilla has engaged in a conspiracy with al-Qaeda to carry out terrorist acts in the United States, it should bring criminal charges against him and try him in a civilian court of law,” said Fellner. “The due process protections of the right to liberty cannot be abrogated with a stroke of the president’s pen.”   Padilla is one of three persons detained as enemy combatants inside the United States. Yasser Hamdi was allegedly captured in Afghanistan, held at Guantánamo Bay, and then transferred to a naval brig in Virginia once it was learned that he was a U.S. citizen. Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, a Qatari national living in the United States, was designated an enemy combatant in June and transferred from the criminal justice system, where he was facing charges of fraud and lying to the FBI, to indefinite military detention.","United States",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/17/sweden-call-full-and-fair-asylum-determination","Sweden- Call for Full and Fair Asylum Determination","Sweden: Call for Full and Fair Asylum Determination","Letter to Swedish Government on Behalf of Hanan Attia","12/17/2003","Human Rights Watch is writing as a matter of urgent concern regarding the case of Hanan Attia. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Ms. Attia and her children were not afforded access to a full and fair asylum determination procedure when they first applied for asylum in Sweden, and that the national security concerns surrounding the case of Ms. Attia’s husband, Ahmed Hussein Mustafa Kamil Agiza, have unduly prejudiced any independent claims that Ms. Attia and her family might have to remain in Sweden.   As you are aware, Ms. Attia and her children first filed for asylum along with Mr. Agiza as a family unit in September 2000. The Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) determined that Mr. Agiza could have a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Egypt. The case, however, was turned over to the government based upon secret evidence provided to the Migration Board by the Swedish Security Police (SÄPO) alleging that Mr. Agiza’s case raised national security concerns because he had been formerly tried and sentenced in absentia to twenty-five years in prison by a military tribunal in Egypt on terrorism-related charges. The secret evidence against Mr. Agiza was not disclosed to him or to his lawyer. In December 2001, the government made a final determination that Mr. Agiza was subject to exclusion from protection in Sweden based on these national security concerns. Mr. Agiza was subsequently expelled from Sweden to Egypt, following diplomatic assurances from the Egyptian authorities that he would not be subject to the death penalty, or to torture or inhuman treatment or punishment, and that he would be afforded a fair re-trial. Mr. Agiza was not afforded an opportunity to appeal his exclusion from protection in Sweden or the order for his expulsion. He has been in prison in Egypt for two years and, to date, no trial has been scheduled. The government’s intervention in Mr. Agiza’s asylum case had the result of also excluding the rest of the family unit, Ms. Attia and the five children, from protection in Sweden.  Ms. Attia was not permitted to appeal her exclusion, and subsequently filed an application with the U.N. Committee against Torture (CAT), seeking a decision from the Committee that she would be at risk of torture if returned to Egypt. In November 2003, the CAT ruled that Ms. Attia had not substantiated her claim, and that her removal to Egypt at the present time would not constitute a breach of article 3 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Ms. Attia’s lawyer then filed an application with the Aliens Appeals Board on her and her children’s behalf for leave to remain in Sweden on humanitarian grounds due to the debilitating mental and emotional state of various family members and in light of their integration into Swedish society over a number of years. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Ms. Attia and her children were never afforded access to a full and fair asylum determination procedure. The Swedish government subjected the entire family to exclusion from any form of refugee protection, but has never claimed that Ms. Attia and her children are a threat to national security and should be excluded from refugee protection based on a full and fair assessment of their claims. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ (UNHCR) Guidelines on International Protection: Application of the Exclusion Clauses  (September 2003) states that the “right to family unity” should operate in favor of dependants, not against them: “Thus, where the main applicant is excluded, family members are not automatically excluded as well. Their claims to refugee status would need to be determined on an individual basis. Such claims are valid even where fear of persecution is a result of the relationship to the excluded relative. Family members are only excluded if there are serious reasons for considering that they too are individually responsible for excludable crimes” (Background Note on the Application of the Exclusion Clauses, paragraph 94). To our knowledge, the Swedish government has not determined that Ms. Attia and her children are excludable from protection because they are individually responsible for excludable crimes.    Moreover, we are deeply concerned that the Swedish authorities employ the “best interest of the child” standard with respect to any decisions affecting Ms. Attia’s minor children, in conformity with the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child and with the UNHCR guidelines on exclusion. These require that all decisions regarding exclusion take into account the best interests of any children affected by a possible exclusion decision.   Human Rights Watch thus calls on the Swedish government to permit Ms. Attia and her children to file a new application for asylum in their own right.  We also urge those authorities involved to use the “best interest of the child” standard for any decisions implicating the welfare of Ms. Attia’s minor children. We are also concerned that the negative decision by the Committee against Torture (CAT) has prompted the Swedish Aliens Appeals Board to assume that no threat exists to Ms. Attia and her children if they are forcibly returned to Egypt. We remind the Swedish government that the requirements for finding a violation of article 3 of the CAT are more restrictive than the obligation of nonrefoulement under both the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (Refugee Convention) and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECHR). The Refugee Convention requires a well-founded fear of persecution that threatens a refugee’s life or freedom for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion (Article 1.A.2). Recognized forms of persecution include, but are not limited to, discrimination; harassment; torture; ill-treatment, including physical and psychological abuse; and sexual violence.  A new asylum application lodged by Ms. Attia in Sweden would necessarily have to consider a wider array of potential threats to her and her children’s lives and freedom than their risk of torture exclusively.  It is important to note that other U.N. mechanisms, including the Human Rights Committee and the Special Rapporteur on Torture, have expressed concern that Ms. Attia was not granted a full and fair asylum determination procedure in the first instance, and that she should be accorded such a procedure in conformity with Sweden’s international obligations.  Moreover, Sweden’s nonrefoulement obligation under article 3 of the ECHR—the prohibition against torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment—is also broader than the prohibition against torture under the CAT.  Ms. Attia’s case must thus be evaluated in light of relevant European Court jurisprudence, including, among other cases upholding the prohibition of refoulement, the 1996 case of Chahal v. United Kingdom. The diplomatic assurances proffered by the Egyptian government for Mr. Agiza apparently include Ms. Attia and her children. However, the circumstances surrounding the possible return of Ms. Attia and her family to Egypt should be distinguished from those surrounding Mr. Agiza’s expulsion and transfer to detention in an Egyptian state prison, where he remains to date.   The Chahal case reaffirmed the prohibition against returning a person to a country where there are grounds to believe that he or she would be at risk of torture or other forms of ill-treatment. The Chahal principle is relevant in at least two additional key respects—it prohibits the return of a person from a Council of Europe member state based on diplomatic assurances from a receiving country where the practice of torture is persistent and entrenched, and it takes into account the ability of a receiving government to gain effective control over those who might perpetrate abuses amounting to a violation of ECHR article 3. Egypt is a country where torture and ill-treatment are routinely practiced. This has been repeatedly acknowledged by a wide array of international actors, including the United Nations and various nongovernmental organizations, and by individual states, including the United States in its annual country reports on human rights practices around the world. Moreover, the European Court held in Chahal that, although it did not doubt that the Indian government offered diplomatic assurances in good faith, many of the forces that perpetrated acts of torture and ill-treatment were not in the effective control of the government.  These same considerations should govern any assessment of Ms. Attia’s return to Egypt in conformity with Sweden’s ECHR obligations.  A new asylum determination procedure would presumably reveal the facts of such actual and potential persecution. But Sweden must also assess Ms. Attia’s case on the basis of its ECHR obligations and the limits the European Court jurisprudence places on reliance upon diplomatic assurances as a safeguard to violations of the nonrefoulement obligation. Finally, Human Rights Watch is concerned that the Aliens Appeals Board did not fully and fairly assess the humanitarian concerns presented in Ms. Attia’s final application for leave to remain in Sweden, which was rejected just this week.  Ms. Attia was subjected to an unfair asylum procedure and prohibited from access to an effective appeal. Her husband was expelled to and imprisoned in Egypt pursuant to an unfair trial in absentia. Ms. Attia and some of her children have been traumatized and remain under psychiatric care. At various times the family in Sweden has been separated and forced into hiding due to fears that they, too, would be expelled and returned to Egypt. Ms. Attia has given birth to one child in Sweden and the other children have, to varying degrees, become integrated into Swedish society.  We urge the government to consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding this case in making a final determination regarding Ms. Attia’s right to remain in Sweden, and that the appropriate services are afforded to Ms. Attia and her children in light of these humanitarian concerns.  Human Rights Watch calls on the Swedish government to permit Ms. Attia to submit a new asylum application and to commence a full and fair asylum determination procedure. We also urge the government to assess this case in light of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights. Positive action in this regard will ensure that Sweden is in full conformity with its international and regional obligations, and that the Swedish state has afforded Ms. Attia and her children all the procedural protections that, in the end, will ensure her and her children’s health and safety.

The 29-page report, “The Warri Crisis: Fueling Violence,” documents how violence in Nigeria’s southern Delta State this year, especially during the state and federal elections in April and May, resulted in hundreds of deaths, the displacement of thousands of people, and the destruction of hundreds of homes. Among the dead were probably dozens killed by the government security forces. At the height of the violence, 40 percent of Nigeria’s oil production was closed down.  “The people of the Niger Delta have suffered horribly from living amid the source of Nigeria’s wealth,” said Bronwen Manby, deputy director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch and the author of the report. “And the perpetrators get away with these crimes without even the faintest chance of being brought to justice.”  The perpetrators of violence in Delta State are armed ethnic militias belonging to the three major ethnic groups in the state—the Ijaw, Itsekiri, and Urhobo—and also the state security forces. During the first half of 2003, Ijaw militia members were particularly well organized in attacking Itsekiri communities living in the creeks of the mangrove forest, where much of the oil is found.  Since the report was finalized, renewed violence has broken out once again in Delta State, with a score of civilians reportedly killed in fighting during the first week of December.  In Nigeria, individuals in government office often have virtually unchecked control over resources. Elections are therefore a focus for violence and fraud. Delta State produces 40 percent of Nigeria’s two million barrels a day of crude oil and is supposed to receive 13 percent of the revenue from production in the state—so control of government positions is a particularly large prize. In addition, the warring factions are fighting for control of the theft of crude oil, known as “illegal oil bunkering.” Illegally bunkered oil accounts for perhaps 10 percent of Nigeria’s oil production, bringing profits that are probably more than US$1 billion a year.  Both politicians and those who head the illegal bunkering rackets—sometimes the same people—employ armed militia to ensure their reelection or defend their operations. On November 24, three journalists at Lagos-based Insider magazine were arrested by the police, detained for two days and charged with sedition and defamation of character, in connection with an article alleging that the vice president of Nigeria and the national security adviser to the president were involved in large-scale theft of crude oil.  “Although the violence has both ethnic and political dimensions, it is essentially a fight over the oil money—both government revenue and the profits of stolen crude,” Manby said. “Efforts to halt the violence and end the civilian suffering that has accompanied it must therefore include steps both to improve government accountability and to end the theft of oil.”  Human Rights Watch suggested that one measure toward ending the violence might be an effort to create a system for “certifying” crude oil as coming from legitimate sources. The report urged that fresh elections be held in Delta State, as in other Nigerian states where national and international monitors found the level of fraud and violence surrounding this year’s elections to be so high that the minimum international standards for democratic elections were not met. A precondition for peace, Human Rights Watch said, is that those responsible for crime be brought to justice.","Africa, Nigeria","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

The arrest of Saddam Hussein, responsible for genocide and crimes against humanity, opens up the real possibility that justice can be done. The fact that he has been taken alive is crucial; a dead Saddam might have been seen by some as a martyr. As a wanted man in the dock, the details of his brutal rule can be exposed. Saddam's crimes, including the slaughter of more than 100,000 Kurds in 1988, have been well documented, not least by Human Rights Watch which has analysed 18 tons of incriminating documents that were airlifted out of Iraq in 1991.  Justice, however, must not only be done, it must be seen to be done. Any sense that Saddam might be exposed to victors' justice or revenge justice would lessen the chance of true stability in Iraq.  The International Criminal Court (ICC), which came into existence last year to prosecute the Saddams, Milosevics and Pinochets of the future, can only hear crimes committed since 1 July 2002, and therefore does not cover Saddam's most serious offences. Even without the involvement of the ICC, international involvement is essential. It is right that the Iraqi people should have ownership of the process but it is regrettable that the law on a war crimes tribunal in Iraq makes little provision to involve international judges.  Part of the problem is the loathing that the US feels for international justice, as reflected by its desire to throttle the ICC at birth. The Iraqi Governing Council, eager not to upset Washington, set out its plans for a war crimes tribunal just last week. The new law does not require international judges to sit alongside Iraqi judges on the hugely complex cases which will follow, including the trial of Saddam himself.  That is regrettable, just as it is regrettable that the death penalty has been retained. International expertise could be essential to ensure that justice is done. The example of the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu - shot after a summary trial in 1989 - reminds us how things should not be done. That execution hindered long-term justice in Romania.  The celebrations after Saddam's arrest should not overshadow the importance of ensuring that we see full due process once he goes on trial. Anything else would be a disservice to the memory of his hundreds of thousands of victims.

Few people are more deserving of trial and punishment. U.S. forces deserve credit for arresting the deposed dictator so that his crimes can be presented and condemned in a court of law, rather than arranging to kill him in combat. But the stakes now are enormous. The fairness of the tribunal he is brought before will determine whether his prosecution advances the rule of law in Iraq or perpetuates a system of arbitrary revenge. Washington says it has not yet decided what to do with him, but the first moves of the U.S.-dominated Iraqi Governing Council are not auspicious. But the stakes now are enormous. The fairness of the tribunal he is brought before will determine whether his prosecution advances the rule of law in Iraq or perpetuates a system of arbitrary revenge. Washington says it has not yet decided what to do with him, but the first moves of the U.S.-dominated Iraqi Governing Council are not auspicious. Saddam Hussein's government was responsible for the murder of a quarter of a million Iraqis. Among the occupants of the mass graves being unearthed in Iraq today are 100,000 Kurdish men and boys machine-gunned to death during the 1988 Anfal genocide, many after having been chased from their homes with chemical weapons; the 30,000 Shiites and Kurds slaughtered after the 1991 uprising; other Shiites killed during the 1980's because of their perceived sympathy for Iran; so-called Marsh Arabs killed as the Iraqi government drained the marshes and destroyed a culture that had thrived for centuries; and many individual Iraqis of all faiths and ethnicities who were singled out, their lives ended, for real or perceived opposition to the regime. To do these victims justice, their plight should be recorded in a court of law and their perpetrators properly judged and punished. But the Iraqi Governing Council, taking its lead from Washington, last week established a tribunal that is to be dominated by Iraqi jurists. Despite the superficial appeal of allowing Iraqis to try their own persecutors, this approach is unlikely to produce sound prosecutions or fair trials. It reflects less a determination to see justice done than a fear of bucking Washington's ideological jihad against any further enhancement of the international system of justice. As we know from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, prosecutions of genocide or crimes against humanity can be enormously complex, demanding jurists of exceptional skill and sophistication. They require amassing volumes of official documents, collecting sensitive forensic evidence from mass graves, presenting hundreds of witnesses from among victims and accomplices, and paying scrupulous attention to the requirements of due process. To avoid being perceived as show trials or """"victor's justice,"""" they call for highly experienced jurists of unquestioned integrity. Saddam's brutal and arbitrary justice system can hardly be expected to have produced such jurists. Prosecutions were typically based on confessions, often induced by torture. Serious criminal investigations, let alone complex trials, were virtually unheard of. The Iraqi Governing Council hopes to solve this problem by looking to Iraqi exiles as well as Iraqis from communities historically repressed by the Baath Party who remained in the country. But even among these it will be difficult to find jurists with the right combination of skills and emotional distance from the former dictatorship to produce trials that are fair - and seen as fair. An internationally led tribunal would be a far better option, whether a fully international tribunalor, more likely, an internationally run tribunal with significant domestic participation, such as the special court set up for Sierra Leone. Because its personnel would be selected by the United Nations rather than by Washington's surrogates, an internationally led tribunal is more likely to be seen as legitimate. And because it can draw from a global pool of talent, it would be better able to secure the experienced and fair-minded jurists than a court that must look only to Iraqis. An internationally led tribunal could still conduct trials in Baghdad and involve Iraqis as much as possible, but it would be run by international jurists with proven records of overseeing complex prosecutions and scrupulously respecting international fair-trial standards. Despite the obvious merits of an internationally led tribunal,Washington is adamantly opposed, which largely explains the path chosen by the Iraqi Governing Council. But Washington's opposition reflects its ideology, not concern for the Iraqi people. The Bush administration calculates that a tribunal of Iraqis selected by its hand-picked Governing Council will be less likely to reveal embarrassing aspects of Washington's past support for Saddam Hussein, more likely to impose the death penalty despite broad international condemnation, and, most important, less likely to enhance even indirectly the legitimacy of the detested International Criminal Court. No one should endorse these self-serving reasons. Governments should encourage Washington to allow an internationally led tribunal to try Saddam Hussein and his henchmen. The people of Iraq deserve no less.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq","International Justice"

The U.S. Fourth Infantry Division took Saddam Hussein into custody yesterday. U.S. forces have not announced what they plan to do with the former Iraqi leader, but have previously made clear their support for an Iraqi tribunal to carry out prosecutions for crimes of the past. Last week, the Iraqi Governing Council created a new tribunal to prosecute the crimes of Iraq´s past. “Saddam Hussein´s capture is a welcome development and it's important that the Iraqi people feel ownership of his trial,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “But it's equally important that the trial not be perceived as vengeful justice. For that reason, international jurists must be involved in the process.” Human Rights Watch has compiled substantial dossiers on the crimes of the former Iraqi leader, and published numerous reports on human rights abuse under his rule, including genocide and crimes against humanity. On December 10, the Iraqi Governing Council issued a law establishing a tribunal to try genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. The tribunal law includes provisions on the rights of the accused and applies definitions of international crimes that are largely consistent with international law. However, key provisions are lacking to ensure legitimate and credible trials. The tribunal law does not require that judges and prosecutors have experience working on complex criminal cases and cases involving serious human rights crimes. Nor does the law permit the appointment of non-Iraqi prosecutors or investigative judges with relevant expertise. “Iraq has no experience with trials lasting more than a few days,” said Roth. “International expertise in prosecuting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity cases must be utilized to ensure a fair and effective trial.” Human Rights Watch said any court conducting the trial must be independent of political influence, and free of bias and partiality. The trial must give the benefit of every protection for the rights of the accused under international law. Saddam Hussein must be allowed to conduct a vigorous defense that includes the right to legal counsel at an early stage. The tribunal law does not prohibit the death penalty and does not ensure that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the law does not sufficiently address protection of witnesses and victims or security for the tribunal and its staff. “Any tribunal trying Saddam Hussein should apply international standards of justice,” said Roth. “To do otherwise would blur the distinction between the Ba´ath Party period and the Iraq of the future.” Human Rights Watch has recommended forming a Group of Experts including Iraqi and international specialists to suggest appropriate accountability mechanisms and facilitate collection and preservation of evidence. A mixed Group of Experts would allow Iraqi jurists to draw on international experience gained from trying serious past crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone, Human Rights Watch said. “The Iraqi Governing Council should partner with the United Nations to create an accountability process that works,” said Roth. “There won´t be a second chance to do this right.” Some of the crimes for which Saddam Hussein might be prosecuted include: The genocidal Anfal campaign against the Iraqi Kurds, which resulted in the deaths of some 100,000 civilians and the destruction of more than 4,000 villages; The use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and Kurdish civilians; The large-scale killings that followed the failed 1991 uprisings in the north and south of Iraq; The destruction and repression of the Marsh Arabs; and The forced expulsion of ethnic minorities in Northern Iraq during the “Arabization” campaign.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq",""

In separate incidents, 15 children were killed by U.S. forces.  A U.S. military spokesman, while publicly regretting the loss of life, did not admit any wrongdoing on the part of the U.S. military in the attacks that resulted in the children's death. In discussing the first incident, which took place December 5, a U.S. military official placed responsibility on armed opposition forces for deploying forces in a residential area. The U.S. military said the """"tragic incident"""" was being investigated. """"The U.S. military takes precautions to minimize civilian loss of life during its operations-but obviously not enough,"""" said John Sifton, Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"There is now a pattern of mistakes, apparently as a result of faulty intelligence, that has led to too many civilian deaths and no clear changes in the way the United States plans and carries out military operations."""" The first incident took place on the night of December 5, in a rural village near Gardez, southeast of Kabul. Six children and two adults died under a collapsed wall after a U.S. air and ground attack on a compound used by an opposition militant to store weapons. The U.S. military knew as early as December 7 about the Gardez strike and the deaths, but only admitted the deaths on December 10 after being asked by a journalist about reports to that effect. The second attack, reported before the first, took place at approximately 10:30 a.m. on December 6 in Hutala, southwest of Kabul. According to both villagers and the U.S. military, nine children were killed during the strike, along with one young man. According to journalists, villagers in Hutala described seeing two planes, later acknowledged to be A-10 attack planes (also known as """"Warthogs"""") circling the area. Warthogs were primary designed to serve as anti-tank attack planes but can also be used to strafe infantry with high-speed machine guns and exploding shells. According to villagers who spoke with journalists, one of the Warthogs circled back and opened fire over one house with its mounted machine guns. A journalist from the New York Times counted over 40 small craters, about half a meter in diameter, in the vicinity of the strike. The nine children killed, boys and girls from ages 9 to 12, were apparently in the line of fire just in front of a house that was the intended target of the strike. Journalists found small shoes, torn prayer caps and bloodstains on the ground, where villagers said the children had fallen and died. According to journalists, the young man who was killed was named Abdul Mohammad, a recently returned refugee from Iran and not-as the U.S. military initially claimed-the intended target. """"In targeting a single house in order to attack a single person, it is unclear why such a heavy weapon was used,"""" said Sifton. """"The United States should reconsider the use of such weaponry in areas where there is clearly a considerable risk of civilian casualties."""" Human Rights Watch stated that Taliban and other anti-U.S forces had in the past placed civilians at risk by attacking U.S. and Afghan government forces from residential areas. In all cases, the United States still must take special precautions when attacking areas in which civilians are known to be present. Human Rights Watch voiced doubt about the U.S. military's claim that it was unaware of civilians being present at the targeted locations. Civilians live within many of the areas in which the United States has conducted military operations. Villagers in one of the targeted areas said that the intended target, Mullah Wazir, had left two weeks before the attack on him took place. """"Stating that the U.S. military didn't know there were civilians present at these sites is simply not an adequate response,"""" said Sifton. """"The laws of war require that an attacking force take all feasible precautions to avoid civilian casualties. Even a cursory inquiry would have alerted U.S. forces to the civilian presence in the area."""" Human Rights Watch called on the United States to review its methods of intelligence gathering and allow an independent international expert to investigate and report on the cause of these and other civilian casualties. Under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, armed forces cannot conduct attacks that cause harm to civilians or civilian objects that is excessive in relation to the anticipated military advantage of the attack. In cases where there is significant doubt as to whether a civilian object-for example, a house-is being used for military purposes, coalition forces are obligated to assume it is not. Names and ages of the children killed: Habibullah, 11; Obaidullah, 10; Faizullah, 9; Ismail Jan, 11; Nabi Jan, 9; Habibullah, 12; Aminullah, 9; Bibi Toara, 10; and Bibi Tamama, 9. According to Reuters, other incidents of civilian casualties caused by U.S forces since the fall of the Taliban in later 2001 include: December 2001 - U.S. defense officials announced AC-130 gunships and Navy fighters attacked and destroyed a convoy in Afghanistan believed to be carrying leaders of the Taliban or al-Qaeda. But reports from the region said the convoy was carrying tribal elders and that about 65 people had been killed. The Pentagon rejected the reports. December 31, 2001 - Villagers of Qalaye Niazi near Gardez in eastern Afghanistan said U.S. warplanes killed over 100 people. At least one fighter jet, a B-52 bomber and two helicopters swooped on the village. July 2002 - The Afghan government said at least 48 people died and 117 were wounded when U.S. planes attacked a wedding party in the town of Deh Rawud in central Afghanistan. The U.S. military said a gunship had come under fire from the area. February 2003 - U.S. bombing raids in the Baghran Valley area of the Helmand province killed 17 people, mostly women and children, according to locals. February 2003 - Reports from locals said eight more civilians died in the Baghran Valley when a U.S. bomber and gunship attacked the area during operations against remnants of the Taliban. April 2003 - Eleven Afghan civilians were killed, seven of them women, when a bomb dropped by coalition aircraft hit a house on the outskirts of Shkin near the Pakistan border, the U.S. military said. September 2003 - At least eight civilians died in a U.S. air strike in the Naw Bahar district of the Zabul province that also killed a Taliban commander, a senior Afghan provincial official said. October 2003 - Air strikes killed eight members of one family in the eastern province of Nuristan, according to local witnesses. Afghan officials said they presumed U.S. or allied warplanes were responsible. November 2003 - Six Afghan civilians were killed in an aerial bombardment by U.S.-led forces hunting Islamic militants in the Barmal district of Paktika province, the governor said.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The use of cluster munitions in populated areas caused more civilian casualties than any other factor in the coalition´s conduct of major military operations in March and April, Human Rights Watch said. U.S. and British forces used almost 13,000 cluster munitions, containing nearly 2 million submunitions, that killed or wounded more than 1,000 civilians. Meanwhile, 50 strikes on top Iraqi leaders failed to kill any of the intended targets, but instead killed dozens of civilians, the Human Rights Watch report revealed. The U.S. “decapitation” strategy relied on intercepts of senior Iraqi leaders´ satellite phone calls along with corroborating intelligence that proved inadequate. As a result, the U.S. military could only locate targets within a 100-meter radius – clearly inadequate precision in civilian neighborhoods. “Coalition forces generally tried to avoid killing Iraqis who weren´t taking part in combat,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “But the deaths of hundreds of civilians still could have been prevented.” International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, does not outlaw all civilian casualties in wartime. But armed forces are obliged to take all feasible precautions for avoiding civilian losses, and to refrain from attacks that are indiscriminate or where the expected civilian harm exceeds the military gain. The term “casualty” refers to both dead and wounded. The 147-page report, “Off Target: The Conduct of the War and Civilian Casualties in Iraq,” also examines violations of international humanitarian law by Iraqi forces, including use of human shields, abuse of the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems, use of antipersonnel landmines, and placement of military objects in mosques and hospitals. The Iraqi military´s practice of wearing civilian clothes also eroded the distinction between combatants and civilians. The Human Rights Watch report also criticizes U.S. air strikes on electrical and media facilities. U.S. and British forces did not secure large caches of weapons and ammunition abandoned by Iraqi forces, and the ready availability of these explosives also led to dozens of civilian casualties. Additional information about British conduct of the Iraq war can be found here. To preserve its neutrality in assessing adherence to the laws of war in the Iraq conflict, Human Rights Watch did not take a position on whether the war itself was justified or legal. Human Rights Watch sent a team of researchers to Iraq between April 29 and June 1 to investigate civilian casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure. The team focused on the main areas of fighting in the Tigris and Euphrates river valleys. Team members visited 10 cities and conducted more than 200 interviews with victims and their families, Iraqi doctors, U.S. and British military personnel, and others. The researchers inspected dozens of bombsites, as well as fields and neighborhoods littered with unexploded cluster submunitions. They evaluated ballistics evidence and hospital records. The researchers also obtained U.S. Department of Defense data that enabled them to pinpoint the locations of cluster-munition strikes. Human Rights Watch estimates that cluster munitions killed or injured more than 1,000 civilians, while “decapitation” strikes killed dozens. The total number of civilians killed in the war is much higher, since it would include people who died as a result of collateral damage from small-arms fire and other factors. Human Rights Watch did not attempt to ascertain an exact number of civilian deaths in the war. “Every death of a civilian in wartime is a terrible tragedy,” said Roth. “But focusing on the exact number of deaths misses the point. The point is that the U.S. military should not have been using these methods of warfare.” In a single day, U.S. cluster-munition attacks in Hilla on March 31 killed at least 33 civilians and injured 109. A hospital director in the southern Iraqi city told Human Rights Watch that cluster munitions caused 90 percent of the civilian injuries that his hospital treated during the war. Human Rights Watch obtained hospital records from Hilla, Najaf and Nasariya indicating 2,279 civilian casualties in March and April, including 678 dead and 1,601 injured. On April 7 a “decapitation” attack, apparently targeting Saddam Hussein on the basis of a satellite phone intercept, killed 18 civilians and destroyed three homes in the Mansur neighborhood of Baghdad. Residents said there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein or any members of the Iraqi government had been there. “The decapitation strategy was an utter failure on military grounds, since it didn´t kill a single Iraqi leader in 50 attempts,” said Roth. “But it also failed on human rights grounds. It´s no good using a precise weapon if the target hasn´t been located precisely.” In its research on previous U.S. armed conflicts, including the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia (https://www.hrw.org/europe/fry.php) and the war in Afghanistan (https://www.hrw.org/asia/afghanistan.php), Human Rights Watch found that the U.S. Air Force was progressively using fewer cluster bombs in populated areas. While the U.S. Air Force continued this trend in Iraq, the U.S. Army launched tens of thousands of cluster submunitions in populated areas. U.S. Central Command reported that its forces used 10,782 cluster munitions overall, with ground forces launching the vast majority. British forces used an additional 70 air-launched and 2,100 ground-launched cluster munitions. “Dud” submunitions, which fail to explode immediately, may kill or maim civilians long after the conflict has ended. The U.S. and British cluster munitions together contained nearly 2 million submunitions. “The way cluster munitions were used in Iraq represents a big step backwards for the U.S. military,” said Roth. “U.S. ground forces need to learn the lesson that the air force seems to have adopted: cluster munitions cannot be used in populated areas without huge loss of civilian life.” The Human Rights Watch report contains numerous maps, satellite images and photographs.","Europe/Central Asia, United Kingdom, Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, United States","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

The Iraqi Governing Council yesterday issued a law creating a tribunal to try serious past crimes. “Iraqis rightly insist that trials for past atrocities are of the utmost importance,” said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. “But any tribunal set up to try these crimes should be fair and effective. Justice must be done and be seen to be done.” Human Rights Watch welcomes the provision of the law that allows for the possibility of appointing non-Iraqi trial and appeals chamber judges with experience in trying serious human rights crimes if the Iraqi Governing Council deems it necessary. The law also includes some important protections for the rights of the accused and applies definitions of international crimes largely consistent with international standards, Human Rights Watch said. At the same time, key provisions are lacking to ensure credible and legitimate trials, Human Rights Watch said. The law does not require that judges and prosecutors have experience working on complex criminal cases and cases involving serious human rights crimes. Nor does the law permit the appointment of non-Iraqi prosecutors or investigative judges, even if they have relevant experience investigating and prosecuting serious human rights crimes. “Up until now, the most complex trials in Iraq have lasted no more than a few days,” said Dicker. “The law should require that international judges with expertise trying serious human rights crimes sit on the bench alongside Iraqis. This would assist, not replace, Iraqi judges in ensuring justice for the horrific crimes committed.” Human Rights Watch is also concerned that the law does not prohibit the death penalty or trials in absentia, and does not ensure that guilt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. In addition, the law does not sufficiently address protection of witnesses and victims or security for the tribunal and its staff. “Allowing the death penalty and trials in absentia sends a message,” said Dicker. “The tribunal might be seen as a court of revenge, not justice.” The Iraqi Governing Council issued the tribunal law without providing any opportunity for transparent consultation or public comment. The drafting should have been transparent to help ensure an effective and fair accountability process, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch had recommended that a Group of Experts including Iraqi and international specialists be created to suggest appropriate accountability mechanisms and facilitate collection and preservation of evidence. A mixed Group of Experts would have allowed Iraqi jurists to leverage accumulated international experience in trying serious human rights crimes, Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch over the years has engaged in extensive work to document human rights violations in Iraq and press for justice for these crimes. Human Rights Watch played a particularly active role in documenting crimes committed as part of the Iraqi government’s genocidal Anfal campaign against the Kurds in 1988. In 1992, Human Rights Watch obtained and analyzed 18 metric tons of Iraqi state documents. In 1994 and 1995, Human Rights Watch urged states to bring a case against Iraq for genocide against the Kurds before the International Court of Justice. Human Rights Watch is preparing a detailed analysis of the tribunal law.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

At the trial of Sasa Cvjetan, Goran Stoparic testified for two hours about the shooting of 19 ethnic Albanians, most of them women and children, by Serbian security forces. The killing took place in the Kosovo town of Podujevo on March 28, 1999, four days after the start of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. “Stoparic took an enormous risk to step forward,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Serbian authorities now have a duty to protect him. If he is harmed, other potential witnesses won’t risk coming forward.” Stoparic, at the time a member of the “Scorpions” group in the Special Anti-Terrorist Unit (SAJ) of the Serbian police, provided a detailed chronology of the events that preceded the killing. He said a wall obstructed him from seeing the shooting itself, but that he heard the shots fired and saw a group of the “Scorpions”—including Cvjetan—change their rifle clips immediately afterward. He said he also heard a discussion among the unit members about the shooting later that day. Stoparic was supposed to testify on December 8, but cancelled, saying he was unwell. In yesterday’s testimony, Stoparic said that, two days earlier, he feared taking the stand because the commander of his unit, Slobodan Medic, was in the court building and had warned him minutes before the scheduled testimony to conceal the truth. According to Stoparic’s testimony, the commander’s brother was among the perpetrators of the crime. The presiding judge issued a formal order of protection for Stoparic, but as Human Rights Watch’s monitoring has found, other war crimes trials in Serbia and Montenegro lack a systematic, properly funded witness protection program. Human Rights Watch also noted that the Serbian prosecutor’s office is obliged to investigate Stoparic’s allegations that other members of the “Scorpion” unit were involved in the Podujevo killings, as well as the obstruction of justice throughout the trial. Background: Serb forces killed 19 Albanian civilians on March 28, 1999, in Podujevo. Seven women and seven children were among the killed. Three buses carrying the “Scorpions” unit arrived in Podujevo early in the morning of that day. Shortly afterward, the unit members left the buses and sought housing for the night. They entered the front yards and ordered the Albanian inhabitants of the houses to leave. Those killed apparently had remained in a house in the center of Podujevo; they were killed in the yard after having been expelled from the house. At the beginning of April 2002, the prosecutor for the southern Serbian town of Prokuplje indicted Sasa Cvjetan and Dejan Demirovic on war crimes charges. The trial began in October 2002, in Prokuplje, with Demirovic tried in absentia because he had absconded. On November 27, 2002, the Supreme Court of Serbia transferred the case to the Belgrade District Court, after the presiding judge and prosecutor in Prokuplje faced acts of intimidation, apparently by supporters of the defendant. The trial recommenced in Belgrade on March 12, 2003. Four survivors, all children at the time of the killings, now reside in the United Kingdom; they testified in the Belgrade District Court on July 9-10, 2003. A number of former members of the “Scorpions” testified in Prokuplje and Belgrade, all claiming that they did not know who was responsible for the killings in Podujevo. Dejan Demirovic, age 28, who moved to Canada in 2001 and was jailed for five months in 2003, is challenging extradition proceedings.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Bush is penalizing more than 20 friendly nations for supporting the International Criminal Court (ICC).    In a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration to grant broad waivers for all states that are currently being penalized. The United States has been pressuring governments that have ratified the ICC treaty to sign bilateral agreements exempting U.S. citizens from the court's authority. Many governments have resisted signing because it would violate obligations under the ICC treaty.   The American Servicemembers Protection Act prohibits military assistance for ICC states that do not sign these agreements, but President Bush can waive the prohibition on national interest grounds. President Bush recently waived some sanctions against six prospective NATO members. More than 20 ICC states still have military assistance being withheld, totaling more than 20 million dollars. Those states include, among others, Benin, Croatia, Ecuador and Mali.   """"It makes no sense for the United States to continue penalizing emerging democracies trying hard to support the rule of law,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program. """"Why waive sanctions for NATO members but punish states like Mali, Benin, and Ecuador that urgently need support?""""   One third of ICC states parties have signed bilateral immunity agreements with the United States, while another two-thirds have refused to sign, many even after being sanctioned. In addition, of all the agreements signed with states parties, only nine are now legally binding. Others require parliamentary approval before coming into effect.   """"After a year and a half of strong-arming states, all the U.S. government has to show for its efforts is a lot of ill will and a few binding agreements,"""" said Dicker. The United States is protecting itself from a phantom threat, with a cure that's worse than the imagined illness.""""    Dicker said the administration has an easy way out: waivers for all ICC states parties.   The Bush administration has long been hostile to the creation of the ICC. Most U.S. allies support the court. Eighteen judges and a prosecutor have been elected.

That is not surprising, because the critics are used to getting a sympathetic response from the Serbian public to any argument they make against the tribunal. The tribunal is an anti-Serb stooge? Everybody in Serbia knows that it is. Americans control the tribunal? They obviously do. The tribunal’s prosecutor does a lousy job in the process against Slobodan Milosevic? Clearly, yes. Over time and unchallenged, these allegations become self-evident truths. Much of the criticism of the Hague tribunal derives from three sets of misperceptions. Some commentators and reporters see the tribunal as a symbol of “the West,” which they have distrusted since at least the 1999 NATO bombardment. Others were not a priori hostile, but turned against it when they concluded that the prosecutor in the proceedings against Slobodan Milosevic was dealing too much with history and politics, and offering little evidence about the responsibility of the accused. Still others have problems with the very idea of bringing in facts about crimes committed by ethnic Serbs before any court. The negative stance could be a perfectly respectable position if it were based on objective analysis and fair understanding of the Milosevic trial, and of the tribunal’s work in general. This is usually not the case, however. The following analysis aims at explaining the main fallacies in public perceptions of the tribunal’s work. All Against the Hague Most importantly, there is the post-Milosevic government with its own reasons to dislike the tribunal, and the crucial impact such a position had on shaping the broader attitude toward the Hague. The government used the mass graves of Kosovo Albanians, discovered in Spring 2001 near Belgrade and in other parts of Serbia, solely as an alibi to surrender Milosevic to the Hague, rather than an impetus for public debate about the recent past, or for criminal proceedings against those responsible. Three years after the fall of Slobodan Milosevic from power, Serbian courts tried only a handful of war crime cases, with scant media coverage. The government has portrayed cooperation with the Hague as a means of receiving economic assistance from abroad, rather than a duty to victims and justice. In sum, the government has stripped the discussion of war crimes responsibility of its ethical dimension. This fed cynicism and a value system that reinforces extreme nationalism. Not exactly the background on which the work of the tribunal would be welcomed. Against this background, it is no surprise that the media treated crimes committed against non-Serbs in the former Yugoslavia as undeserving of attention. With the exception of the newspaper Danas and Television B-92, they have refrained from addressing the issue of war crimes. In contrast to Serb politicians and media, the Hague tribunal keeps bringing the issue to the fore. Resistance, and outright hostility, is a natural response. The hostility exploded when the trial of Slobodan Milosevic began, in February 2002, with testimonies about the crimes in Kosovo. Commentators of all colors joined in the search for weaknesses in the testimonies of Kosovo Albanian witnesses for the prosecution. Witness accounts of unspeakable crimes were mentioned only in passing, if at all; the core of the reporting and analyses consisted in thrashing the witnesses for real or alleged contradictions and lies. A month after the beginning of a trial expected to last several years, Serbian observers concluded that the prosecutor was not doing a good job. In fairness, the exaggerated reporting has improved slightly in the meantime, at least in the several outlets not completely insensitive to criticism about the inflamed reporting at the beginning of the trial. But the damage had already been done. The public had already been inclined to distrust the Hague, and the reporting and commentary on the Milosevic trial have only encouraged such an attitude. Orders and Joint Criminal Enterprise Many in Serbia wrongly believe that the prosecutor has to prove that Milosevic ordered crimes to be committed, and, consequently, they judge that the prosecution has done a poor job because it has not produced proof of such orders. Reporters and analysts in Serbia have failed to inform the public that, to have Milosevic convicted, the prosecution does not have to show that he issued orders. It need only prove that Milosevic participated in a joint criminal enterprise whose purpose was to forcibly remove non-Serbs from territories in Croatia, Bosnia, or Kosovo. Or, it must prove that Milosevic held an effective command position, knew or should have known about the crimes, but failed to take reasonable measures to prevent them and bring the perpetrators to justice. Both joint criminal enterprise and responsibility of a superior are well-established concepts in international criminal law, and neither requires proof of issued orders. Understanding these two concepts requires some effort among those who are not trained lawyers. One cannot blame the reporters and the public for lacking legal expertise. On the other hand, one would expect the reporters to acquaint themselves with legal standards underlying the trial, and, in the meantime, to avoid making definitive judgments—such as that the prosecutor is failing to prove the case. The concept of the joint criminal enterprise has caused particular confusion, although the concept is straightforward. A group of bank-robbers are all criminally responsible for a robbery, as participants in a joint criminal enterprise; the purpose of the joint criminal enterprise is, obviously, to rob the bank. Less straightforward is that if during the robbery one group member waits outside in the car, and another member kills a person in the bank, the person outside will be responsible not only for the robbery (which he agreed to) but also for the killing (which he may not have agreed to). This is so because the killing was a natural and predictable consequence of the robbery, and the person waiting in the car was aware of the risk. Applied in the context of the Milosevic trial, the concept of the joint criminal enterprise means the following: If the prosecutor can prove that Milosevic planned, prepared, or committed ethnic cleansing, or even only instigated or aided and abetted those who committed it, Milosevic is criminally responsible for ethnic cleansing. With regard to killings, property destruction, imprisonment, torture, and other crimes accompanying the forcible transfers of non-Serbs, Milosevic is criminally responsible for them too, even if he did not agree to the commission of those crimes, if the crimes were predictable consequence of the “cleansing.” (This is not to suggest that Milosevic disagreed with those crimes; the point is that even he did, he can be criminally responsible). Domestic law also contains rules closely resembling those that outline the concept of joint criminal enterprise. Under the law in Serbia and Montenegro (article 26 of the Basic Penal Code), those who formed or used a group or a plot for the purpose of committing criminal acts are responsible for all crimes arising from the criminal plan, regardless of the role—if any—the individual had in the commission of each specific crime. The law also includes the concept of complicity, with responsibility of an accomplice for acts committed directly by others. Politics and Greater Serbia Most persons in Serbia believe that the tribunal is trying Slobodan Milosevic for having started the wars in the former Yugoslavia, in pursuit of creating a “Greater Serbia.” Those who believe it accuse the tribunal of being “political.” However, none of the three indictments against Milosevic—for Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo—charge him with the attempt to create Greater Serbia by starting the wars. Only the indictment for Croatia makes reference to a link between Milosevic and Greater Serbia, stating that Milosevic’s “calls for the union of all Serbs in one state coincided with those agitating for the creation of a ‘Greater Serbia.’” The sentence is descriptive and does not constitute a criminal charge. Milosevic is indicted for something else: for forcible removal of non-Serbs and for other crimes committed therein. If he had worked toward realizing a political goal (the creation of a Serb-dominated state) without war crimes—forcible transfers, killings, destruction of properties, and other—he would not be criminally responsible. More sophisticated among the critics advance a slightly different argument against the Milosevic trial: they say the prosecutor politicizes the case by dealing with the break-up of Yugoslavia and not solely with war crimes. Now, untangling the “political” from the strictly “legal” components of the testimonies by prosecution witnesses is possibly the most complicated aspect of the Milosevic trial. One should bear in mind that the indictments accuse Milosevic of participation in a joint criminal enterprise. To show that a joint criminal enterprise existed, the prosecutor has to show that those participating in the enterprise had a common purpose or plan. According to the indictments, the purpose of the joint criminal enterprise in which Milosevic allegedly participated was the forcible transfer of the majority of the non-Serb populations from parts of Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo. To show that forcible transfer indeed was the purpose, the prosecutor should make a plausible case that forcible transfers had some goal, rather than being an unintended consequence of chaotic events. As the prosecution suggests, the goal behind forcible transfers was to join parts of Croatia and Bosnia to a new, Serb-dominated state, and to ensure continued Serbian control over Kosovo. That is why the prosecutor has introduced witnesses who talked about Milosevic’s intent to join parts of Croatia and Bosnia to the new state—about “politics,” that is. But in this context politics is legally relevant. The Prosecutor’s “Weak Case” Mesmerized by the exchanges between Milosevic and the witnesses he cross-examines about Greater Serbia and responsibility for wars, the reporters and commentators in Serbia mainly miss the segments of the testimonies addressing joint criminal enterprise and the responsibility of a superior. Numerous witnesses testified that forcible transfers and other crimes alleged in the indictments did take place, and were systematic. Others testified that the immediate perpetrators of the crimes were members of the Serbian police and the Yugoslav Army, or other armed groups assisted from Belgrade through provision of arms, logistical support, cadres, and in other ways. Milosevic, according to testimonies, had effective control over the responsible units, or aided and abetted their actions (which included foreseeable crimes). Milosevic also knew or should have known about the crimes, but—it would follow from the testimonies—he did not take measures to prevent the crimes or have the perpetrators punished. Numerous testimonies corroborate the above conclusions. It is therefore astonishing when critics make no reference to them and bluntly assert that the prosecution is “doing a poor job.” This assessment is difficult to square with what has been heard in the courtroom from witnesses including: Milan Babic; Aleksandar Vasiljevic; Captain Dragan (and the tape from the Red Berets ceremony); Dr. Michael Williams; Peter Galbraith; Charles Kirudja; Slobodan Lazarevic; Zoran Lilic; Andreas Riedlmayer; Jeri Laber; Osman Selak; protected witnesses B-24, B-104, B-127, B-129, B-161, B-1455, C-013, C-47, C-1149, and others; as well as numerous Kosovo Albanians who testified about crimes in Kosovo. An Anti-Serb Prosecutor and a U.S.-Controlled Court? The imbalance between the numbers of Serbs and members of other ethnic groups indicted in the Hague (the ratio is roughly 2.5:1) causes a particular stir among Serbs in the former Yugoslavia. The conclusion they infer is that the office of the prosecutor is biased against Serbs. The critics appear to not have considered the basic question: if hundreds of people from over a dozen different countries work in the office of the prosecutor, is it probable that all or most of them have something against Serbs? An affirmative response is not likely to sound serious, and the proponents of the theory of an anti-Serb office of the prosecutor never ask the question. If the question is asked, however, a possible response is that those working in the office of the prosecutor are unbiased professionals. The high number of indictments against Serbs might then stem from a higher number and a more systematic nature of the crimes committed by armed Serb formations, compared to the crimes committed by other parties. Srebrenica, Sarajevo, Foca, Vukovar, a dozen mass killing incidents in Kosovo, forcible transfers of hundreds of thousands of people at gunpoint, are crimes that were less numerous and systematic on other sides, or did not exist (there is no equivalent for Srebrenica on the other sides). In addition to that, before the fall of Milosevic Hague investigators could barely approach the witnesses of crimes against Serbs, and this obstacle slowed down the preparation of cases against non-Serbs. Also, the recent killings of Kosovo Albanians who testified in Kosovo trials against former KLA commanders should convince a skeptical observer that the Hague prosecutor indeed faces difficulties in finding Kosovo Albanians willing to testify against other Albanians. These difficulties are all the more important because the structure of the KLA was more dispersed than that of the Serbian police or Yugoslav army, and proving command responsibility might be more difficult. Another strongly held belief among many in Serbia is that the Hague tribunal is subservient to the United States. The critics in Belgrade took as evidence of this the news that representatives of the U.S. government would sit in the courtroom during the upcoming testimony of General Wesley Clark, with the authority to demand protective measures if segments of the testimony would prejudice U.S. national security interests. What they overlooked was that the government of Serbia and Montenegro exercised that same right in June 2003, during the testimony of the former Yugoslav president Zoran Lilic. Two representatives of the embassy in the Netherlands, Slavoljub Caric and Miodrag Panceski, sat in the courtroom and could have demanded protective measures, pursuant to tribunal’s Rules of Procedure and Evidence. Critics also claim that the United States provides most of the funding for the tribunal and, as result, can shape its work. The reasoning on the cause-and-effect relation between funding and control is dubious in itself; in any event, it is based on wrong facts. The bulk of the funding (approximately 95 percent) actually comes from the regular U.N. budget, and only a small part from a special trust fund through which states contribute financial resources. Unreliable Allies Tribunal critics in Serbia compensate for the absence of compelling arguments with repeated assertions, and invoke similar assertions of their like-minded. To see how it works in practice, take the recent piece by veteran foreign affairs columnist Dragoslav Rancic, published in Politika of November 22, 2003. Rancic quotes “the most recent assessments abroad” that purportedly corroborate his thesis about the tribunal as a political instrument in the hands of big Western powers, and of the U.S. in particular. The article will be described in some detail, because the abdication from objectivity and professionalism by Serbia’s leading and otherwise fair-minded author suggests how other, less credible ones, treat the tribunal when they write about it. Rancic invokes articles published in Junge Welt, Washington Times, and New York Times, a commentary read in a Radio France International program in South-Slavic languages, and a statement by the ICTY Judge Wolfgang Schomburg. With the exception of Judge Schomburg’s, all quotes contain simple assertions in lieu of developed arguments, so the value of the quotes lies solely in the presumed credibility of the sources. But on closer inspection, the sources either miss credibility, or simply do not say that “the tribunal is a political instrument in the hand of big Western powers,” which is how Rancic introduces them. Junge Welt is a former German Democratic Republic communist newspaper, now only communist, and extreme to the extent that in the paragraph quoted by Rancic it suggests there no crime was committed in Srebrenica. The Washington Times article is an opinion piece by Paul Craig Roberts, a (“paleo”-)conservative isolationist hostile to every international organization in which the United States “dissolves” a part of its sovereignty, including the Hague tribunal. The author of the Radio France International commentary is Stanko Cerovic, a long-time proponent of radically anti-Western views imbued with apocalyptic and Kafkaesque tones; his writings arguably make for interesting literature, but hardly a serious analysis, as illustrated by the following sentence from the commentary Rancic cites: “Micunovic himself, the presidential candidate, might be indicted tomorrow. He doesn’t know why, but the [Hague] tribunal will know.” Finally, there remain the New York Times and Judge Schomburg. These are respectable sources, but they do not say that the tribunal is a political instrument in the hands of Western powers. The quote from the New York Times only argues in favor of bringing the work of the tribunal to the close by the end of the decade, which is precisely what tribunal’s own exit strategy envisions. One week after Rancic’s op-ed in appeared Politika, a New York Times editorial opened with the following sentence: “In its nearly 10 years, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has been fair and thorough.” So much for the New York Times as an ally against the tribunal!) As for Judge Schomburg, also quoted in Rancic’s article, he points at the risk of the court’s addressing historic issues. Without examining the statement in full, it is difficult to conclude what Schomburg really said, all the more so because during the recent trial of Milomir Stakic the same judge argued in favor of the tribunal’s elucidation of the broader context in which crimes took place. Like Rancic, other journalists in Serbia resort only to those foreign sources—no matter what their credibility—which they hope would confirm the negative picture of the tribunal. The Belgrade magazine Nin, for example, writing about the tribunal invoked Jeffrey Kuhner, an American journalist and critic of the tribunal. Nin failed to inform its readers that Kuhner is a passionate defender of “Storm” and the operation in the Medak pocket, and that he criticizes the tribunal because it has indicted Ante Gotovina and Janko Bobetko for the crimes committed during or immediately after the two actions. Utterly unheard in the media are the views of the serious international lawyers who maintain that Milosevic enjoys greater privileges in the proceedings than the defendants in any national trial (Geoffrey Robertson), or who systematically monitor the proceedings on the spot and, at the end of the first year of the trial, found that the Hague prosecutor offered evidence warranting conviction of Milosevic (Avril Macdonald, Heikelina Verrijn Stuart). Taking Responsibility The resentment against the Hague tribunal is not likely to subside soon. The hostility is at its peak, and some analysts recently even blamed the ICTY Office of the Prosecutor for the poor result of the democratic candidate at Serbia’s presidential elections, in early November 2003. One is to hope that the government and intellectual elites will, sooner rather than later, come to grips with their responsibility and take a more rational approach to the issues of war crimes and the Hague tribunal. Maybe the individuals and parties that became prominent as a result of the wartime pathology derive benefit from the tendentious coverage of the ICTY. Everybody else is losing.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

The Macedonian government, its Western counterparts, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) should redouble efforts to ensure them dignified living conditions.   in Macedonian The briefing paper, “Out of Limbo? Addressing the Plight of Kosovo Roma Refugees in Macedonia,” describes the dismal conditions that Kosovo Roma refugees face in Macedonia. Human Rights Watch urges the Macedonian government to make stronger efforts to improve their status in the country, and calls on Western governments and the UNHCR to seriously consider resettlement for those refugees who are in a particularly difficult situation. “These refugees are in a cruel limbo,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “Most of them clearly can’t return to Kosovo while their prospects for integration in Macedonia remain dim. It’s high time that the Macedonian government and its Western European counterparts end this untenable situation.” Macedonia is currently hosting some 2,500 Roma refugees displaced from Kosovo as a result of the 1999 war. In May, Macedonian authorities and UNHCR closed Shuto Orizari, the largest camp hosting Roma refugees, due to unacceptable health and sanitary conditions. To draw attention to their desperate situation, the 700 Roma who had lived in the camp then occupied an area in the immediate vicinity of the Macedonian-Greek border, near the village of Medzitlija. On August 9, exhausted and frustrated by the lack of visible achievements after 80 days of protest, the Roma refugees abandoned Medzitlija for several other locations within Macedonia. “While the Medzitlija crisis has passed, a viable long-term solution for the Kosovo Roma refugees in Macedonia continues to elude the Macedonian government and relevant international actors,” said Denber. The Human Rights Watch briefing paper argues that conditions are inappropriate for the return of most Kosovo Roma, because their property in Kosovo was destroyed when they were expelled and their security cannot be guaranteed there. Relocation to other parts of Serbia and Montenegro is also not an option, because the Kosovo Roma already displaced to these areas face undue hardship in meeting what UNHCR terms as their basic social, cultural and economic needs. The Serbia and Montenegro government itself acknowledges that living conditions for displaced Roma in Serbia are “extremely poor.” For the time being, the only two practical options for the refugees appear to be resettlement to third countries or integration in Macedonia. But the latter option is feasible only if the Macedonian government and relevant international agencies significantly improve the legal, economic and social situation of the affected Roma. Most of the Kosovo Roma refugees favor resettlement in third countries, but EU member states appear to be unwilling to accept them. “Resettlement should not be excluded when countries of refuge are coping with a protracted refugee crisis of this kind,” said Denber. “For more than four years now, the Macedonian government has failed to provide these refugees with a sustainable existence, making the prospect of integration ring hollow.” Human Rights Watch argues that third countries with resettlement policies, working with the UNHCR, should give serious consideration to accepting those individuals whose prospects for safe voluntary return to Kosovo and integration in Macedonia are particularly dim. At the same time, and as long as conditions for safe return to Kosovo are not in place, the Macedonian government, with the assistance of international institutions, should strengthen efforts to recognize the status of Roma refugees, and enable them to fully enjoy their rights under the Refugee Convention as well as other human rights treaties. BACKGROUND: Most Roma refugees in Macedonia owned property in Kosovo, had regular employment and attended schools. Their conditions in Macedonia, in contrast, continue to be dreadful. Roma families who live in refugee camps are packed in small rooms housing many family members. Those living in private accommodation can afford to rent only small, suffocating rooms, and have been forced to move up to 10 times during their three or four years of living in refuge. Most Roma refugee children in Macedonia do not attend school or do so irregularly. Many Roma parents are too poor to buy clothes and books needed for school; those children who do attend face harassment by non-Roma students. Human Rights Watch found that Macedonian authorities have not taken adequate measures to protect Roma children from harassment and ensure their equal access to education. A formal ban on employment on “temporarily humanitarian assisted persons,” in effect until July 2003, prevented the Roma refugees from working legally in Macedonia. Some managed to find temporary seasonal jobs—such as construction work and canal digging—in the “black economy.” Recently adopted legislation authorizes their employment under certain conditions. However, having been removed from the labor market for four years, and divested of most of their assets and the means needed to launch private enterprises, Roma continue to find it exceptionally difficult to find any employment. The high unemployment rate in Macedonia, compounded by discrimination against Roma in employment, is another impeding factor. The general unemployment rate in Macedonia is between 30 and 35 percent, while in the municipality of Shuto Orizari, where most of the Roma live, it is approaching 90 percent. Information gathered by Human Rights Watch indicates the Macedonian government will grant the status of persons under humanitarian protection in Macedonia to most of the Kosovo Roma in the coming months. As such, they would have fewer rights in Macedonia regarding employment and social security than would be the case if the government recognized them as refugees. To date, the Macedonian administrative bodies and courts have generally denied Roma asylum on the grounds that Kosovo Roma could relocate to another part of their country of origin, or that their physical integrity in Kosovo was not endangered. The Human Rights Watch briefing paper calls on the Macedonian authorities to refrain from resorting to these clearly unjustified rationales in the decision-making on asylum claims based on the new Law on Asylum and Temporary Protection, adopted in July.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Reflection on the fragility of progress and the challenges faced by our movement. Rededication to defending the human rights cause and the important gains that have been made. And renewal of the international machinery that can counter human rights abuse and ensure the commitments that governments made ten years ago in Vienna become a reality. Ten years ago, in June 1993, the international community came together to reaffirm its commitment to uphold universal values at the Vienna World Conference on Human Rights. Overcoming tired old debates about cultural relativism and the hierarchy of rights, representatives of more than 170 states declared """"the universal nature of these rights and freedoms is beyond question… All human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated."""" Those were days of great confidence and optimism for the human rights movement. The Cold War had ended amidst a breathtaking wave of democratic change in formerly authoritarian states. Long-term political prisoners finally saw the light of day and even became presidents. The appointment of a United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights promised new leadership and vision for human rights on the world stage. Activists mobilized worldwide around a wide range of human rights issues and their voices were increasingly heard in the corridors of power. In the years that followed, there were major steps forward for the human rights cause. A new Convention on the Rights of the Child gained almost universal acceptance. The Beijing Conference gave new attention to women's rights. The tide turned internationally against forced disappearances, torture and the death penalty. Landmines were banned and new efforts made to stop child soldiering and the worst forms of child labor. Former dictators finally faced justice and an international criminal court was established to try the very worst human rights crimes when nations failed to act. There was a new understanding of the centrality of human rights, good governance and the rule of law to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Business and other economic actors began to embrace the human rights and social responsibility agenda. But this was also the decade of Rwanda and Bosnia, where the ghosts of genocide rose once again to haunt the international community. They were years in which the world ignored, or sometimes fuelled, ongoing and brutal conflicts in Colombia, Israel and the Palestinian territories, Chechnya, the Great Lakes region and Afghanistan. A time when the gap between rich and poor countries grew wider, when the stroke of a pen by trade and finance officials could deprive millions of their livelihoods or basic services in an increasingly globalized economy. It was a decade in which the HIV/AIDS epidemic devastated communities and destroyed the lives of a new generation. A period when millions of people were uprooted but faced closed doors where once they found protection. A time that gave rise to failed states, mutant regimes and new, nihilist forms of terrorism. Then, since the terrible events of September 11, 2001, the human rights cause has faced new challenges and threats. The threat of terrorism - a crime against humanity when intended to kill large numbers of civilians - still hangs over millions of people. Meanwhile, around the world, governments have passed regressive anti-terrorism laws that threaten basic rights. They have detained suspects without charge or due process and transferred them between countries even where they risk torture or unfair trial. In some places, those branded as terrorists have faced assassination and extra-judicial execution. Ten years ago at the Vienna Conference, human rights were being attacked in the name of so-called """"Asian values"""" that purported to put community interests and public order ahead of individual rights. Governments were arguing that economic and social development came first and civil and political rights would follow. Now those arguments have been largely dispelled, but governments are attacking human rights on another old front, using the rhetoric of counter-terrorism to justify abuses and crackdowns on their political opponents. Where once western powers stood firm in their condemnation of human rights abuses, today they resort to the same tactics themselves, or offer a wink and a nod to repressive allies in the fight against terrorism. The international human rights system, built over decades by governments themselves, has come under unprecedented strain. The Commission on Human Rights, the world's highest human rights forum, has been largely hijacked by abusive governments intent on screening themselves and each other from international scrutiny. The expert mechanisms set up to monitor human rights are overstretched and under political attack. The post of High Commissioner for Human Rights remains vacant following the tragic death of Sergio Vieira de Mello. The Security Council is failing to deliver on its commitments to protect civilians in armed conflict and post-conflict transition. And the United States is pursuing an ideological vendetta against the International Criminal Court. So this Human Rights Day should be a time of reflection, rededication and renewal.

(Report available at https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/uslabor/). U.S. labor laws contain weak penalties, are riddled with loopholes, and are not effectively enforced. The Employee Free Choice Act of 2003, introduced in both houses of Congress on November 21, would remedy some of the major shortcomings in existing law. Passage of the bill would provide relief for the thousands of workers stuck in negotiations with employers who bargain in bad faith, year after year, with no intention of ever reaching agreements. These workers would be able to seek mediation and then arbitration, leading to binding contracts. Currently, the only remedy for such illegal behavior by employers is still more bargaining, trapping workers in fruitless negotiations that lead nowhere. The proposed law would also strengthen remedies for illegal anti-union conduct during organizing drives and negotiation of initial union contracts. Penalties now are so minor that employers treat them as a cost of doing business—a small price to pay for a union-free workplace. “Employers violate workers’ right to freedom of association, knowing they’ll face few, if any, consequences,” said Pier. “This bill would finally make them think twice before breaking the law.” Under the Employee Free Choice Act of 2003, workers would also be able to choose between two options for gaining union recognition—a card check or the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election process. Anti-union conduct is rampant during union election campaigns, often making elections coercive and hostile rather than free and fair. Workers can try to avoid such elections by asking that their employer recognize their union based on signed worker authorizations—a card check. But employers can, and often do, refuse. Under the proposal, if the NLRB authorized the results of the card check, employers would have to accept them. In this new system, workers’ chances of freely exercising their right to freedom of association would increase dramatically. “It’s high time the United States showed the world that its professed support for workers’ human rights is not empty rhetoric but official policy,” said Pier. “Passing this bill would be an important first step.”","United States","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

On previous occasions we have presented you with our views on the importance of the ICC and we will not reiterate those here. We write now, however, to convey our assessment of the impact of the U.S. government's policy against the court. The administration's approach has created the impression worldwide of an aggressive and highly objectionable effort to hold U.S. citizens - as well as foreign nationals working for the U.S. Government - above the law. The policy has been implemented with a """"big stick"""" and little concern for potential damage to respect for the rule of law, national democratic processes, human rights standards and even the U.S. government's bilateral relations with its closest allies.   We certainly welcome the recent decision by President Bush to waive some sanctions imposed under the American Servicemembers Protection Act (ASPA) for six future NATO member states that refused to sign a bilateral immunity agreement - or a so-called Article 98 agreement. We urge that the national interest waiver be extended to a much larger group. States such as Mali (a fledging democracy), Benin (a source of peacekeeping troops in Liberia) and Trinidad and Tobago (a partner in U.S. drug interdiction efforts) are still being penalized under the ASPA. A policy that sanctions small democratic states trying to uphold the rule of law while waiving sanctions for European states is indefensible. This inconsistency leaves the United States appearing as if it only values European military allies. We urge you to extend the waiver to all states, thereby putting an end to a policy whose costs have far outweighed any conceivable benefit.   The campaign to achieve exemption agreements with all ICC states parties has often generated intense resistance. Such resistance is rooted, not in anti-American sentiment, but rather in a deep commitment to the ICC treaty and the principle of the equal application of the law to all. It is undoubtedly in the interest of every member of the international community that states take seriously their obligations under international treaties. For the U.S. then to continue to penalize states for duly respecting international law is reprehensible.   Legal Misinterpretation   For non-surrender agreements with ICC states parties to have any legal validity, they must be consistent with the provisions of the ICC Treaty. United States officials have repeatedly insisted that the agreements they seek are consistent with Article 98 of the Rome Statute. However, Article 98's reference to """"sending state"""" envisions Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs). That the International Criminal Court Statute refers to non-surrender agreements in this context does not mean that any conceivable non-surrender agreement would be consistent with the treaty. Those proposed by U.S. officials go far beyond the terms of Article 98 by applying to all U.S. citizens and non- U.S. nationals working under a government contract, not just """"sent"""" personnel. For U.S. diplomats to continue to insist otherwise has persuaded few. Indeed, many governments believe that, even under an Article 98 agreement, it is inconsistent with the purpose of the ICC treaty to surrender anyone suspected of committing an ICC crime on the territory of an ICC State Party to any government that does not recognize the duty of the ICC to ensure good-faith prosecutorial efforts.   The High Cost of the U.S. Policy   By attacking the International Criminal Court the administration risks weakening respect for the rule of law and human rights as well as international legal standards generally. If the United States government is unwilling to contribute to strengthening the rule of law through the ICC, it should certainly not be a counterweight to progress.   You should also consider the high cost the effort has had on your important bilateral relations worldwide, from Latin America to the Caribbean, to Africa and Asia. Some U.S. officials have touted """"success"""" by citing the number of bilateral agreements signed. Reality, however, tells a different story; the United States has achieved far less than some of its officials would have the world believe. So far, after nearly one and a half years of extremely heavy pressure, only one third of ICC states parties have signed a bilateral immunity agreement, while another two-thirds have remained firm in not signing, many of them even after being sanctioned. In addition, of all the agreements signed with states parties and non-states parties less than 20 have actually entered into force and only nine ICC States Parties, out of 92, are legally bound by a non-surrender agreement with the U.S. government.   Moreover, boasting about the number of agreements signed ignores the enormous resentment the policy has engendered. Many states, including close U.S. allies, signed only after having been threatened and coerced. Officials from a number of governments have stated publicly that they believe the agreements violate their international treaty obligations, their domestic laws and in some cases even their constitutions. Several states have signed agreements only in the face of what their diplomats have labeled """"unbearable"""" pressure, including threats to cut not only military aid, but humanitarian aid, and economic assistance as well.   When the United States threatens sanctions it will, of course, have some initial success even in compelling countries to violate their own laws and policies. But Washington is sending the message that it is an ally only so long as it is able to force strict compliance with its agenda. When national interests diverge, the United States does not respect other states' policies. Claiming as justification that the United States simply does not want to be bound by a treaty that it has not ratified is disingenuous, since the issue is not the ICC assuming jurisdiction over crimes committed in the United States - a matter over which the U.S. government retains complete control - but whether other governments can determine who prosecutes crimes committed on their territory without regard to the power of the perpetrator's government.   The course the administration has pursued comes with an extremely high price tag, including weakening the principle of the equal application of the law and respect for multilateral institutions. Moreover, it has been damaging to U.S. credibility worldwide. Now is the time to step back from an extremely costly approach and """"cut your losses."""" We urge you to reconsider the campaign against the ICC and certainly to extend national interest waivers to all ICC states parties that have not signed a so-called Article 98 agreement.

""""President Bouteflika's initiative to address 'disappearances' is welcome, but it doesn't sufficiently address the need for justice,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Verifying cases and offering families compensation, steps that are both long overdue, cannot substitute for thoroughly investigating these crimes against humanity and holding the perpetrators accountable.""""

In addition, there are hundreds-if not thousands-of cases of persons who remain missing after being abducted by armed Islamist groups fighting the government. According to its mandate, defined by a presidential decree made public in November, the new commission will focus on confirming cases of """"disappearance,"""" securing legal assistance for families, and drafting proposals for state compensation and assistance to the victims' relatives. The Human Rights Watch report reveals that the commission will have to push the limits of this mandate if it is to probe how each """"disappearance"""" was carried out and who the perpetrators were. New cases of """"disappearances,"""" though rare, demonstrate that authorities have not institutionalized legal safeguards to deter the practice, Human Rights Watch said.

There will be no place for Robert Mugabe at the summit table. Zimbabwe, suspended from the Commonwealth in 2002, was not invited. So before they start their meetings, perhaps the Commonwealth leaders should look around their host country, which, among other things, shelters Liberia's ex-president Charles Taylor, indicted on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Under President Olusegun Obasanjo, who took power in 1999, the Nigerian military and police have killed hundreds; others have died in intercommunal conflicts that the government has done little or nothing to address. In one case, the army killed more than 200 villagers in reprisal for an incident in which an armed group attacked and killed 19 soldiers. The 'Miss World riots' in the northern city of Kaduna last year were portrayed as senseless religious violence. It was rarely mentioned that the police killed dozens during the riots, which were prompted by political, not religious, tensions. Thanks to its oil reserves, Nigeria could be a wealthy country. Instead politicians amass vast sums in their personal accounts, while the great majority of Nigerians live in extreme poverty. In the spring, Obasanjo was returned to power in elections during which EU observers noted serious irregularities and fraud, and both the ruling party and its opponents sent out armed thugs to assault their rivals. Yet the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, described the elections as a 'landmark in the advancement of Nigeria's democracy' and, although more than 100 people were killed, welcomed the 'relative calm' in which they took place. People protesting against a visit to Nigeria by President Bush in July describe how they were tortured on the orders of senior officials. One told Human Rights Watch how he heard the federal police chief order that he be taken out and 'squeezed'. When people demonstrated against increased fuel prices, a senior police official ordered that they be shot on sight if they did not disperse within half an hour. Police went on to kill at least a dozen people. They beat a photographer, telling him: 'This is for the pictures you people take!' Even the prospect of the summit has not restrained the Nigerian authorities. In November, three journalists were arrested and charged with sedition after an article alleged the involvement of senior officials, including the vice-president, in large-scale theft of crude oil. Police also disrupted public processions to commemorate the execution in 1995 of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni activists. Some of those arrested were told they would be killed 'like Saro-Wiwa'. So what's the difference between Nigeria and Zimbabwe? The former produces large amounts of oil and, with more than 50 million Muslims, counts as a valuable ally in the 'war against terrorism'.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Nigeria, Zimbabwe, United Kingdom","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

Report Lays Groundwork for Rights Agenda","","12/07/2003","A United Nations report to be released today provides the roadmap for a national human rights program in Mexico, Human Rights Watch said today. The report, which contains dozens of detailed recommendations for the Mexican government, will be presented to President Vicente Fox by the representative of the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in a public ceremony in Mexico City. “The U.N. report opens a window of opportunity for progress on human rights in Mexico,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “It is the first comprehensive assessment of the full range of human rights problems in the country, and it has the backing of both the Mexican government and the United Nations.” The report is the product of the technical cooperation agreement with the U.N. High Commissioner’s Office that President Fox signed on his first full day in office in December 2000. The second phase of this agreement, launched in July 2002, mandated the drafting of the report and stipulated that the Mexican government would develop a national human rights program based upon its recommendations. The problems addressed in the report are chronic and often deeply rooted in the very institutions designed to address them. The justice system, for instance, for decades has failed to punish abusive state practices, such as the forced disappearances and political killings of the government’s “dirty war” against leftist activists in the 1970s. In some instances, the justice system even encourages abuses, such as by allowing law enforcement officials to get away with torturing criminal suspects. The justice system has also failed to protect vulnerable populations from discrimination and violent crime. A dramatic example of this failure is the unsolved murders of hundreds of young women and girls over the last decade in Ciudad Juárez, a city on the U.S. border in Chihuahua state. “It is crucial that the government use the report’s recommendations to craft a national agenda to tackle the country’s longstanding human rights problems,” said Vivanco.","Americas, Mexico",""

For more than a decade, China has raised hostage politics to an art form, releasing a few prisoners or even a single prisoner ahead of major international meetings in order to deflect criticism of its abysmal human rights record China's bids to host the Olympics and join the World Trade Organization led to single-prisoner releases, which in the twisted world of international politics were greeted by some as concessions by China. And then, as planned, the revolving door pushed more government critics into China's appalling prison system Over the years the event most likely to trigger a prisoner release has been a high-level diplomatic visit between the United States and China. Such visits always put China's human rights record in the spotlight, though in recent years increased trade (and more recently the Bush administration's desire to placate China while it helps sort out the North Korea nuclear problem) have greatly reduced the priority placed on human rights by the United States in its relations with China But when Prime Minister Wen Jiabao visits Washington next week, the U.S. government has the chance to show that human rights remain at the core of U.S.-China relations. It can also put a permanent end to the charade of allowing China to score points through its revolving door prisoner releases In February 1999, during the run-up to the United Nations human rights meeting, Beijing released Gao Yu, a young journalist. Not long after, Gao Yu was seized again for a series of articles published in Hong Kong analyzing Chinese politics. In February 2000, two weeks before Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's plane touched down in China, Chinese officials released Gao Yu to a second round of applause One week before President Jiang Zemin visited President George W. Bush at his Crawford ranch in 2002, Beijing released the Tibetan nun Ngawang Sangdrol, first arrested for taking part in a pro-independence demonstration in 1989 at the age of 13 This October, China did it again. Kang Yuchun, an advocate for a multiparty political system, was released from jail just days before a European Union delegation arrived in Beijing to discuss trade - and human rights. But while Kang's release is cause for celebration, in the past two months, Chinese authorities have also jailed nearly a dozen activists, lawyers and religious leaders around the country. The revolving door continues to spin It is always a welcome development when a political prisoner is freed. But the release of one, two or even a few high-profile prisoners does nothing to address China's systemic rights crisis. And in too many cases, when the world stops paying attention, and the activists pick up their work again, Beijing re-arrests them. Others are exiled into the political wilderness In recent years, hundreds of Chinese citizens have been arrested for political crimes. Clearly, getting China to release a single prisoner at a time is not making a dent in the prison population or discouraging future political arrests The United States should greet Wen Jiabao with a demand that China release all prisoners sentenced for what are in reality political crimes. These include using the Internet to call for government reform, publicizing an AIDS scandal, petitioning for government reform, organizing workers and worshiping outside state-controlled venues Vice President Dick Cheney, Wen Jiabao's host, should demand that China stop censoring the Internet and blocking access to sites featuring sensitive topics like human rights. Washington should call for Beijing to pass a law prohibiting discrimination against people with the AIDS virus. U.S. officials should aggressively promote workers' rights to form independent trade unions The United States should also stress the need for the rule of law to guard against arbitrary arrest, to ensure fair trials and to guarantee Chinese officials do not place themselves above the law. (China should reply by demanding that the U.S. stop flouting international law by detaining hundreds at Guantánamo Bay, at Bagram airbase in Afghanistan, and elsewhere, without the right to a hearing or access to a lawyer.) China's one-release strategy is worthy of the sixth-century strategist Sun Tsu, who wrote, """"Before doing battle, one calculates in the temple, and one will win because calculations were made."""" Beijing has made a calculation that wins every time: jail many, release one, and the world will praise its progress on human rights.

The conference was sponsored by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the British embassy and Freedom House. On December 3, a representative of the hotel where the conference was to take place informed the group that government authorities had told them in person not to allow their premises to be used for the conference. On December 4, a representative of the National Center for Human Rights, a department under the Presidential Administration, told the Mothers Against the Death Penalty and Torture that the conference had been prohibited from going ahead. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told diplomats that the meeting could not take place because the group was not a registered organization. In 2002, the Ministry of Justice had denied the registration application of Mothers Against the Death Penalty and Torture. After a ministry official told the group that the ministry would not register a group with that name, the group in January reapplied for registration under the name Mothers Against Crimes Against the Individual. Although the Ministry of Justice is obliged by law to inform an applicant of its decision within two months, to date the group has received no reply. Uzbekistan has a long history of refusing to register independent human rights organizations and treating their activities as effectively illegal. All but two independent national human rights groups—the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan and Ezgulik, registered in March 2002 and March 2003 respectively—remain banned and vulnerable to harassment by the authorities. Each registration occurred only after sustained international pressure. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in March adopted a country strategy for Uzbekistan that set three human rights benchmarks for the government to fulfill, one of which is the registration and free functioning of independent civil society groups. The bank gave the government a one-year deadline for compliance with these benchmarks. “Unfortunately this is just another example in a long list of setbacks for fulfilling the human rights benchmarks set by the EBRD earlier this year,” said Denber. “The international community must firmly and publicly condemn this appalling move by the Uzbek government and make clear that this type of behavior will seriously affect their relations with Uzbekistan.” Tamara Chikunova, the director of Mothers Against the Death Penalty and Torture, was among the numerous Uzbek civil society activists who participated in the EBRD’s annual meeting, which took place in Tashkent in May, and capitalized on the openly critical discussions that took place there on the Uzbek government’s poor human rights record. In his press conference held at the conclusion of the bank’s meeting, EBRD President Jean Lemierre pledged to react to incidents of government harassment against local groups and added, “we have no difficulty in making it public and letting you know.” At least five international guests had already flown in to Tashkent from other countries to attend the conference. The first indication of the Uzbek government’s intention to hinder the conference from taking place came a week ago, when organizers were forced to relocate from the original venue—an international business center—after being informed that the premises would be used for a major governmental meeting and thus were no longer available.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"

Memorial is one of the very few civil society groups that is able to gather information on the ground in the republic. As the Russian government has spared no effort to close Chechnya to scrutiny, people around the world have come to rely on Memorial to provide crucial information on violations of human rights there. The Chairman of the Jury of the MEA, Hans Thoolen, called Lida one of the most courageous women in Europe today. He stated """"there is complete consensus among all human rights organizations that Lida deserves the award for her tireless efforts in a situation of war and extreme danger, with increased risk for women"""".

Of course, the situation in Zimbabwe has deteriorated further since Australia led the Commonwealth's last intervention. High levels of political violence against opposition supporters continue. Rallies by human rights and civil society groups are routinely disrupted. And all independent news media has been suppressed.   In Pakistan, too, members of the political opposition and former government officials continue to be harassed, threatened and arbitrarily detained. Furthermore, far-reaching amendments to the constitution have dramatically strengthened the power of the presidency, and they have formalised the role of the army in governance and diminished the authority of elected representatives.   But Commonwealth leaders would do well to pay some attention to similar problems in Nigeria, and use the opportunity presented by the Abuja meeting to press for meaningful reform. Their host, President Olusegun Obasanjo, has championed the human rights cause, but the values that he claims to champion are beyond the reach of most ordinary Nigerians.   Human rights abuses continue to impede Nigeria's democratic transition. Since Obasanjo came to power in 1999, his Government has been responsible for serious human rights abuses, including the massacre of hundreds of people by the military in Odi, in 1999, and in Benue, in 2001, for which no one has yet been brought to justice. The portrayal of the """"Miss World riots"""" in Kaduna in July 2002 as senseless religious violence concealed the fact that the Nigerian security forces committed dozens of unlawful killings under cover of these disturbances.   And journalists, human rights activists, opposition politicians and peace activists have faced detention, ill-treatment and other forms of intimidation, simply because they have criticised Government policies.   Last April's elections, which returned Obasanjo to power for a second term, were marred by violence and intimidation, as well as widespread rigging. Much of this was carried out by supporters of the ruling party, and few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. Unlike the case in Zimbabwe or Pakistan, however, Commonwealth countries warmly welcomed these elections and remained silent about the electoral violence.   As awful as this sounds, remember that Obasanjo has also played host to former Liberian president Charles Taylor, who is wanted for war crimes in Sierra Leone. This must be the only case of one Commonwealth country sheltering a war criminal wanted for abuses in another Commonwealth country.   Nigeria has played a very helpful role in support of Liberia's political transition, such as hosting peace talks and arranging for Taylor's safe passage from the country. But this should not extend to shielding Taylor from justice before the Special Court in Sierra Leone. Taylor's presence in Nigeria is an ongoing source of insecurity in the region, an insult to his victims in Liberia and Sierra Leone and an affront to the Commonwealth's values and commitment to international justice.   Howard, Tony Blair and other Commonwealth leaders should speak out on these issues or risk being accused of double standards, which would undermine the effectiveness of their interventions on Zimbabwe and Pakistan, and the Commonwealth's commitment to human rights itself. The message to Obasanjo should be clear: Hand over Taylor, end impunity for human rights abuses and initiate long-lasting political reforms.","Africa, Asia, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Australia",""

From December 8-12, El Salvador will be participating in the final round of negotiations for the U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA), a proposed trade pact with profound implications for labor rights. The 110-page report, """"Deliberate Indifference: El Salvador's Failure to Protect Workers' Rights,"""" documents serious violations of workers' human rights and examines the role of the government. It features case studies in the private and public sectors, in manufacturing and service industries, and concludes that workers face an uphill battle to exercise their rights, regardless of the sector. Three of the highlighted companies supplied internationally known, U.S.-based apparel corporations. Human Rights Watch found that employers delay salary payments, fail to pay overtime due, deny mandatory bonuses and vacation payments, and pocket workers' social security contributions, preventing them from receiving free public health care. Most pervasively, employers use myriad tactics to violate workers' right to freedom of association. Employers routinely fire union members and leaders, target trade unionists for suspension, pressure workers to renounce their union membership, and deny jobs to union """"troublemakers."""" In this hostile climate, only about 5% of workers in the country have successfully organized. Workers are usually out of luck if they seek redress for these violations. Illegally fired trade unionists are not entitled to their jobs back. Instead, the fine for firing them is so minor that, if imposed at all, it is seen merely as a small cost of doing business. Employers are not explicitly banned from discriminating against trade unionists in hiring and can legally manipulate suspensions to affect union members disproportionately. According to the International Labor Organization (ILO), the country's overly burdensome requirements for union registration are """"excessive formalities"""" that """"seriously infringe . . . the principles of freedom of association."""" The Salvadoran Ministry of Labor further exacerbates the problem by narrowly interpreting the requirements in order to impede union registration. Even the few protections that exist are barely enforced. Labor inspectors fail to follow legally mandated inspection procedures: they conduct inspections without talking to workers, deny workers inspection results, fail to fine abusive employers, and refuse to rule on issues within their mandate. The Labor Ministry regularly ignores employers' illegal anti-union conduct designed to thwart organizing drives. And in extreme cases, the ministry collaborates with employers to commit labor law violations and abuse workers' human rights, for example by honoring illegal employer requests that workers sign company liability waivers before receiving severance pay. If workers turn to El Salvador's labor courts for relief, they find long delays and often insurmountable procedural obstacles. The law affords no """"whistleblower"""" protection for coworkers brave enough to testify on behalf of fired colleagues, and there is no guarantee that favorable judgments will be enforced. In the many cases where employers close their factories and flee, proceedings may stall completely because Salvadoran law has no mechanism to allow cases to go forward if defendants cannot be found to be served with legal papers. The report notes that resource constraints are another obstacle to effective labor law enforcement, with reportedly only 37 labor inspectors covering a workforce of roughly 2.6 million. In recent years, the United States has sent millions of dollars in development assistance to address this lack of enforcement capacity and other shortfalls. But the money has done little to improve respect for workers' human rights. """"Limited resources are a problem, but what you have in El Salvador is a serious lack of political will to protect workers' rights,"""" said Pier. """"More funding only helps if there's a desire to enforce the law. What we need here is a fundamental change in the government's attitude toward labor rights."""" The report comments that such an attitude shift should be encouraged by strong labor rights provisions in CAFTA but laments that the current proposal is not sufficient. If that proposal were adopted, the trade pact would only require countries to enforce their existing labor laws, even if those laws, like El Salvador's, fail to meet international standards. Instead, CAFTA should require local labor laws to meet international norms and establish a transitional mechanism to ensure that countries' labor practices meet basic standards before trade benefits are phased in. """"If CAFTA goes into effect with the labor rights provisions currently proposed, abuses like those we documented will continue,"""" said Pier. """"El Salvador will enjoy ever-greater tariff benefits for goods made by workers whose rights are flouted. That's inexcusable."""" The report also calls on El Salvador to strengthen its labor laws by requiring reinstatement for workers illegally fired or suspended for legitimate trade union activity, banning anti-union hiring discrimination, and streamlining union registration requirements according to ILO recommendations. Human Rights Watch urges the Ministry of Labor to uphold workers' human rights by following legally mandated inspection procedures, facilitating rather than obstructing union registration, and refraining from participating with employers in illegal anti-union conduct. The report is available at https://www.hrw.org/reports/2003/elsalvador1203/ Selected Case Studies Before it closed in March 2002, Confecciones Ninos was a maquila-a factory in a free trade zone assembling goods for export-that reportedly supplied garments to U.S.-based corporations such as Wal-Mart, JC Penney, Perry Manufacturing, Kellwood Company (and its subsidiary Koret of California), Kahn-Lucas-Lancaster, and Kmart. A Confecciones Ninos worker told Human Rights Watch, """"We were required to meet goals, . . . [but] if we reached our goals, it was because we didn't get up for the bathroom or water. . . . I got a kidney infection because I didn't go to the bathroom . . . or get a drink. I went to the doctor, and he gave me treatment, but he said that I had to drink water and use the bathroom. . . . But the boss doesn't understand that. He's interested in production.""""       Confecciones Ninos workers began a union-organizing drive in March 2001. In September, they requested the Ministry of Labor to register their union. But the employer responded by calling union members ungrateful traitors and threatening to fire them if they refused to sign statements denying that they had attended the union's founding assembly. Under pressure, five workers signed the statements-enough to bring membership below the minimum number required for union formation. With no further investigation, the Labor Ministry denied the union registration, based largely on the coerced statements submitted to the government at least two weeks past the legal deadline. Lido, a baked-goods factory, fired 11 union leaders and 52 union members in May 2002 and between October 14 and November 4, 2002. One of the leaders commented to Human Rights Watch, """"The goal of the company is that the union cease to exist. . . . The workers are afraid. . . . They are afraid because the union leaders are outside. When we were inside, we intervened if they were denied permission to use the bathroom.""""       Lido paid the 52 fired union members the severance pay due for illegal dismissals. But in exchange, Lido required the workers to sign company-prepared job resignations and liability waivers. Under economic duress, the workers signed, not willing to challenge the requirement in lengthy and onerous court proceedings. With resignations tendered and legal claims waived, Lido could not be fined for the illegal anti-union firings nor for illegally dismissing union members in order to destroy the union. Lido thus successfully evaded the law's weak union protections.       And the government partnered with Lido in the scheme. The company sent 22 of the fired workers to the Labor Ministry to claim their severance pay. Government officials refused to turn over the money owed unless workers signed the statements drafted by Lido. The union's general secretary commented, """"We consider that . . . [the Ministry of Labor] is collaborating with the company so that the union will cease to legally exist.""""","Americas, El Salvador","Economic Justice and Rights, Child Labor"

In the letter, Human Rights Watch highlighted the case of Amir Mir, Senior Assistant Editor of the monthly magazine Herald, whom Musharraf reportedly threatened at a November 20 reception for Pakistani newspaper editors. Musharraf is reported to have condemned the Herald for being """"anti-army"""" and working against the """"national interest,"""" and argued that the time had come for the Herald and Mir to be """"dealt with."""" Musharraf's comments reportedly included specific references to stories filed by Mir for the magazine. Two days later, unidentified persons set Amir Mir's car ablaze outside his house. Mir later received a message purporting to be from the Pakistani intelligence services (ISI) claiming responsibility for the attack and warning that this was """"just the beginning."""" """"General Musharraf should publicly disassociate himself from the comments about the Herald and order an investigation into the attack on Amir Mir's car,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of creating an environment hostile to the press, it is the responsibility of the Pakistani authorities to protect journalists."""" Human Rights Watch also raised the case of Rasheed Azam, a journalist and political activist from Khuzdar in Balochistan province, who was arrested on charges of sedition in August 2002 for publishing a photograph of Pakistan army personnel beating a crowd of Baloch youth. Human Rights Watch has learned that Azam was abused and tortured by members of the Pakistani military, including beatings while hung upside down and sleep deprivation. Azam remains in jail after his bail application was rejected by the district judge. His colleagues have filed a bail application in the Balochistan High Court that awaits hearing. Human Rights Watch wrote a letter to General Musharraf about Azam on October 10 this year, but to date has received no response. Since Musharraf's 1999 coup, the Pakistani government has systematically violated the fundamental rights of members of the press corps through threats, harassment, and arbitrary arrests. Many have been detained without charge, mistreated and tortured, and otherwise denied basic due process rights. The government has sought to, and in several cases succeeded in, removing independent journalists from prominent publications. Meanwhile, the arrest of editors and reporters from local and regional newspapers on charges of sedition is becoming increasingly commonplace. Human Rights Watch urged General Musharraf to demonstrate a commitment to genuine press freedom by releasing journalists arrested on trumped-up charges, and to bring to an end the use of coercion, intimidation and torture in his dealings with the national and regional Pakistani print media. """"It is time for General Musharraf to show the world whether he is a reformer -- or no different from other military rulers,"""" said Adams. """"How he deals with press freedoms is a big test.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/02/nigeria-freedom-expression-under-attack","Nigeria- Freedom of Expression Under Attack","Nigeria: Freedom of Expression Under Attack","","12/02/2003","(New York, December 2, 2003) — The Nigerian government has been responsible for killings, torture, and harassment of its critics over the last two years, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released today. The 40-page report, “Nigeria: Renewed Crackdown on Freedom of Expression,” documents killings, arrest, detention, ill-treatment, torture and other forms of harassment and intimidation of real or perceived critics of the government over the past two years. Most of these abuses have been carried out by the Nigerian police or by members of the intelligence services known as the State Security Service (SSS). “Commonwealth leaders meeting in Abuja should not give Nigeria a free pass on human rights,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Even though military rule has ended, Nigerians still cannot express themselves freely without fear of grave consequences.” Brutal measures have been used to repress critical expression. In the most serious cases, people have been shot dead simply for exercising their right to protest. During massive public protests in July at an increase in the price of fuel, between 12 and 20 people were shot dead by the police in Lagos, in the oil city of Port Harcourt, and on the outskirts of Abuja. The victims included peaceful protestors and passersby who were not even involved in the protests. The report also contains the testimonies of individuals who were among a group of around 30 people arrested after staging a peaceful protest outside the U.S. embassy in Abuja against U.S. President George W. Bush´s visit to Nigeria in July. They were detained for two weeks and several were tortured on direct instructions from the highest levels of the police force. “President Obasanjo´s promises of democracy mean little as long as people are being detained, tortured and shot simply for expressing views critical of the government,” said Takirambudde. “No one has been brought to justice for these acts.” The Human Rights Watch report also describes the harassment of opposition party supporters and other political activists since the April and May elections, in which President Obasanjo and his ruling People´s Democratic Party won a comfortable victory. The elections themselves were marred by political violence, especially in the south and southeast of the country, and by widespread fraud and ballot-rigging. The government and the security forces have since tried to prevent political rallies from taking place. Members of organizations agitating for autonomy for the Yoruba or Igbo ethnic groups have been arrested and detained unlawfully. Human rights activists and journalists have borne the brunt of the government’s crackdown, including harassment by the police and attempts at censorship on several occasions in the past two years. Several journalists have been physically assaulted. Most recently, on November 21, Psaro Yornamue, a journalist in charge of the Rivers State office of the Daily Independent newspaper, on his way to his office was beaten and threatened in connection with an article he had written alleging corruption by the state’s deputy governor. On November 24, three journalists at Insider magazine were arrested by the police in Lagos, detained for two days and charged with sedition and defamation of character, in connection with an article alleging that the Vice-President and the National Security Adviser to the President were involved in large-scale theft of crude oil. Since completing research on the report, Human Rights Watch has been informed of further worrying incidents. In November, police disrupted public processions organized by activists of the Ogoni ethnic group to commemorate the execution of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists in 1995. On November 10 in the southern oil port of Bonny, police arrested 17 Ogoni activists, several of whom stated that they were beaten by the police. The activists, who were released the following day, face charges of unlawful procession and conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace. Police also arrested more than 20 Ogoni activists in a suburb of Port Harcourt on November 14, on the grounds that they had taken part in a commemorative vigil on November 9. Leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) have also received personal death threats in recent weeks. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting is scheduled to take place in Abuja from December 5-8. “Foreign governments remained virtually silent about election violence in Nigeria, yet abuses during the Zimbabwe elections provoked widespread condemnation,” said Takirambudde. “Unless the Commonwealth addresses abuses in all of its member countries and denounces them accordingly, it will stand accused of maintaining double standards and its credibility will be undermined. There is no excuse for Commonwealth leaders to turn a blind eye to human rights abuses in the very country where they are meeting.” Human Rights Watch has also written to President Obasanjo setting out recommendations on human rights for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and urging him to hand over former Liberian president Charles Taylor to the Sierra Leone Special Court.","Africa, Nigeria","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

On December 2 and 3, the World Bank will convene Vietnam's annual donor meeting in Hanoi, attended by 50 countries and financial institutions, making up the Consultative Group on Vietnam. The group will discuss Vietnam's progress on reform and poverty reduction and make aid pledges for the coming year. """"Vietnam's already dismal human rights record has sunk to new depths this year,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Vietnamese government has spent the year arresting and imprisoning dozens of Buddhists, political dissidents, 'cyber-dissidents,' and ethnic minority Christians."""" The Vietnamese government has reacted defensively to resolutions passed this month by the European Parliament and the U.S. House of Representatives that are strongly critical of Vietnam's human rights record. """"Diplomats in Hanoi should keep up the pressure,"""" said Adams. """"Donors should make sure that Vietnamese government officials at the highest levels know that the international community is serious about seeing immediate action to protect human rights."""" Harsh Treatment of Buddhists Persecution of members of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), which is not officially recognized by the government, has increased in recent months. The government appeared to be easing up on the group earlier this year, when UBCV leader Thich Quang Do was released from two years of administrative detention and Prime Minister Phan Van Khai visited UBCV Supreme Patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. However, in October a standoff took place between police and the two UBCV leaders, who were stopped en route to Ho Chi Minh City and accused of carrying documents containing state secrets. The monks were allowed to return home, but then placed under unofficial house arrest. Dozens of other members of the UBCV are now effectively confined to their pagodas, which are under strict police surveillance. Phone lines are cut or monitored and movement in and out of the pagodas is restricted. Four monks have been formally sentenced to two years of administrative detention: Thich Tue Sy, Thich Thanh Huyen, Thich Nguyen Ly, and Thich Dong Tho. Internet Dissidents Vietnam has increased restrictions on Internet use, while detaining and imprisoning individuals on charges of espionage or circulating material critical of the government via the Internet. Cyber-dissidents who have been detained or sentenced to prison since the end of last year include Nguyen Dan Que, who was arrested in March 2003; Le Chi Quang, sentenced to four years in prison in November 2002; Nguyen Khac Toan, sentenced to 12 years in December 2002; Nguyen Vu Binh, held incommunicado since his arrest in September 2003; Pham Que Duong, arrested in December 2002; Tran Khue, arrested in December 2002; Pham Hong Son, sentenced to 13 years in June 2003 (reduced to five years in August 2003); and Nguyen Vu Viet, Nguyen Truc Cuong, and Nguyen Thi Hoa, relatives of political prisoner Father Nguyen Van Ly, who were sentenced to five, four and three-years of imprisonment respectively in September 2003 but released for time served after an appeals trial on November 28, 2003. More than 100 Montagnard Christians in Prison Montagnard Christians from the Central Highlands comprise a significant portion of people imprisoned in Vietnam for their religious or political views. Human Rights Watch has records of 124 Montagnards who are currently serving prison terms of up to 13 years for nonviolent political activism, organizing Christian gatherings, or for attempting to seek asylum in Cambodia. All of the arrests have taken place since February 2001, when thousands of Montagnards peacefully marched on provincial capitals in the highlands, launching a movement for return of ancestral lands and religious freedom. At least 60 Montagnards have been arrested and detained this year alone. The situation has been especially tense since August, when the government launched a fresh wave of arrests and sealed off the highlands. Authorities have dispatched additional police and military to the region and established military checkpoints along the main roads. Strict restrictions are enforced on travel within the highlands, on meetings of more than two people, and on communication with the outside world. Gathering for Christian worship outside of the home is largely forbidden. Possessing a cell phone to make international calls brings the very real threat of arrest. Montagnards who voluntarily returned from the Cambodian refugee camps are placed under strict surveillance and sometimes house arrest, as are asylum seekers who have been forcibly repatriated from Cambodia. Security is especially tight during the visits to the Central Highlands of diplomatic or foreign press delegations. Government officials continue to force Montagnards to sign pledges or announce in public self-criticism sessions that they will renounce Christianity and cease any political or religious activities. Authorities have also forced Montagnards to sign """"voluntary"""" papers pledging to withdraw petitions opposing government confiscation of their land. To escape the repression, dozens, and possibly hundreds, of Montagnards have fled from their villages and gone into hiding in Vietnam. Most are unable to seek asylum in neighboring Cambodia, which has sealed its border and enforces a policy of forced repatriation of Montagnard asylum seekers. The repression in the Central Highlands is expected to become even more intense this month, when officials invariably detain evangelical Christian leaders and shut down Christmas worship services, which are perceived as linked to the Montagnards' political organizing. Recommendations During the discussion of governance issues at the Consultative Group meeting, donors should press Vietnam to take the following steps: Unconditionally release all persons being held for the peaceful expression of their religious and political views. End the practice of detaining and prosecuting persons in secret, and in particular make public the names of all persons held for political and related activities. Achieve greater transparency and accountability in the legal and penal systems and work towards the establishment of an independent and impartial judiciary. Give advance notification of trial dates and allow international observers and independent monitors access to trials and to persons in pretrial or administrative detention and in prison. Invite the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which visited Vietnam in 1994, to visit again. The working group should be allowed unrestricted access to police stations, district and provincial jails, military-operated detention centers in border areas, as well as prisons such as Ba Sao prison in Nam Ha province, where most of the Montagnard political prisoners are currently held. Amend or repeal Vietnam's Criminal Code to bring it into conformity with international standards. Eliminate ambiguities in the Criminal Code's section on crimes against national security, to ensure that these laws cannot be applied against those who have exercised their basic right to freedom of expression. Repeal the 1997 Administrative Detention Directive 31/CP, which authorizes detention without trial for up to two years for individuals deemed to have violated national security laws. The government should ensure that all detainees receive a fair trial within a reasonable time as required under international law. Address the grievances of the indigenous minorities of the Central Highlands, including land confiscation, repression of religious freedom, lack of educational opportunities, pressure to join family planning programs, and restriction of freedom of assembly, association, and of movement. Lift the bans on religious gatherings and other meetings and cease the pressure on Montagnard Christians to renounce their faith and cease political activity. Cease the persecution, unlawful arrest, torture and other mistreatment of Montagnards who have voluntarily or forcibly been returned from Cambodia to Vietnam. Insist that the government allow unrestricted access to the Central Highlands by diplomats, independent journalists, and by U.N. human rights experts such as the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Religious Freedom (who visited Vietnam in 1998). Human Rights Watch urged both bilateral and multilateral donors not only to insist that the Vietnamese government take the essential steps required to strengthen human rights protection but to provide any technical assistance needed. Donors should closely monitor Vietnam's progress in meeting its reform commitments at the donors' mid-year meeting next year.","Asia, Vietnam",""

The government should also ensure that none of the refugees, including those who participated in the demonstrations, are forcibly returned to Burma, where they would likely face persecution. On November 12, riot police used water cannons, electric batons, and canes to forcibly disperse a group of 500 Burmese nationals, many already recognized as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), who were staging a protest outside the UNHCR office. Many had been protesting since October 20 the decision by UNHCR to cut its allowance for refugees in India from 1,400 rupees (U.S. $30) a month by as much as 60 percent in order to cut costs and promote """"self reliance."""" At least 25 of the demonstrators were injured. Many of the injuries were severe, and included head and chest injuries, bruised backs and legs, and broken bones. """"There was no need for the police to use violence to break up a demonstration,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is disturbing that the world's largest democracy would repress people who have already been victimized in their own country."""" On November 12, police officers detained several hundred protesters at four different police stations. Most were released that night. Twenty-four protesters were sent to Tihal Central Jail in New Delhi and charged with rioting and obstructing the police. The New Delhi police commissioner declared a 30-day curfew effective November 12 in order to prohibit any gathering within 200 meters of the UNHCR office. On November 13, after more than 100 protesters gathered again in front of UNHCR, police officers arrested another 20 Burmese and sent them to Tihal Jail. In the days following the arrests, large numbers of protesters have continued to gather near the UNHCR office. The UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms provides that law enforcement officials shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force, and they may do so only if other means remain ineffective or without any promise of achieving the intended result. Human Rights Watch urged the Indian government to investigate and prosecute or discipline as appropriate any police officer found to have used or authorized excessive force. The government must also ensure that those protestors charged with criminal offenses have access to legal counsel; those not charged should be released. """"India can demonstrate to these refugees that in a democracy the rule of law prevails even for the weakest,"""" said Adams. Of the 42 demonstrators arrested and charged so far, two have been released on bail. According to UNHCR, 16 of the 44 are recognized by UNHCR as refugees under the 1951 Refugee Convention, and another 14 have cases that are pending. UNHCR has recognized approximately 1,000 Burmese in New Delhi as refugees. The majority are ethnic Chin Christians from northwestern Burma, who fled to Mizoram state in India after the unrest in Burma in the mid-1990s. In recent years new refugee flows have been caused by arbitrary detention, torture, forced labor and religious persecution by the Burmese government, as well as ongoing warfare between government forces and the Chin National Army.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), India",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/02/nigeria-under-scrutiny","Nigeria Under Scrutiny","Nigeria Under Scrutiny","","12/02/2003","The Nigerian government, which is proudly hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting beginning today needs to get its own house in order before it can claim credibility in terms of human rights.  Despite President Olusegun Obasanjo's leading role in regional initiatives such as the New Partnership for Africa's Development (Nepad), and his many public statements promoting human rights and good governance, the values he claims to champion are beyond the reach of most Nigerians.   Obasanjo, himself a former military head of state, may be less ruthless than some of his military predecessors. But since he came to power in 1999 his civilian government has been responsible for serious human rights abuses. Justice has been the exception rather than the rule. No one, for example, has yet been charged or tried for the massacre of hundreds of people by the Nigerian military in Odi in Bayelsa State in 1999 and in Benue State in 2001.   A Human Rights Watch report, to be released today, exposes the government's alarming crackdown on freedom of expression. The assumption that since the end of military rule Nigerians can express themselves freely is false. This year journalists, human rights activists, opposition party members and peaceful demonstrators have been arrested, detained, and suffered ill-treatment and intimidation, because they criticised government policies.   In recent weeks police have disrupted public processions organised by Ogoni activists to commemorate the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists in 1995. On November 10 in the southern oil port of Bonny, police arrested 17 Ogoni activists, several of whom said they were beaten. The activists face charges of unlawful procession and conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace.   Police arrested more than 20 Ogoni activists near Port Harcourt four days later because they had taken part in a vigil. Leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People have also received death threats in recent weeks.   And last Monday, three journalists from Insider magazine were arrested by Lagos police, detained for two days and charged with sedition and defamation of character, in connection with an article alleging that the vice-president and national security advisor were involved in large-scale theft of crude oil.   In extreme cases, the government's reaction to dissent has resulted in killings and torture. Peaceful protesters who demonstrated against US President George Bush's visit to Nigeria in July were arrested and tortured on the orders of senior police officials.   Large public demonstrations protesting against an increase in the price of fuel in June were dealt with brutally by the police. At least 12 - and possibly more than 20 - people were shot dead and several journalists covering the protests were beaten.   Elections in April and May, which returned Obasanjo to power for a second term, were marred by violence and intimidation, fraud and ballot-rigging. Scores of people were killed and many more injured.   Human Rights Watch found that much of the violence was carried out by supporters of the ruling People's Democratic Party. Few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice.   Yet the elections were warmly welcomed by governments in Africa, Europe and the US. Most foreign governments remained silent about the electoral violence. Their reactions to the elections stood in stark contrast to their statements on Zimbabwe. The southern African country has been publicly and repeatedly condemned by the international community.   Nigeria's friends have a crucial role to play in denouncing abuses and in pressing President Obasanjo to deliver on his promises to the Nigerian people. The forthcoming Commonwealth summit, which will be held in Abuja, presents the perfect opportunity.   Unless they address such abuses in all Commonwealth countries, governments will stand accused of applying double standards.   If they persist in turning a blind eye to human rights abuses in the country where they are meeting, or allow themselves to be muzzled by diplomatic considerations, the credibility of the Commonwealth will be seriously undermined.   Nigeria, as the summit's host and a close diplomatic ally of key Commonwealth actors such as Britain and South Africa, should not be allowed to escape scrutiny.   On the contrary, African and western governments alike have a responsibility to use their political and economic alliances with Nigeria to push for significant improvements.   Their message to President Obasanjo should be clear: End impunity for human rights abuses, and initiate reforms that will ensure genuine and long-lasting democracy in Nigeria.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Nigeria, United Kingdom","Press Freedom, Free Speech"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/12/01/africa-gender-inequality-fuels-aids-crisis","Africa- Gender Inequality Fuels AIDS Crisis","Africa: Gender Inequality Fuels AIDS Crisis","Success in Fighting AIDS Hinges on Protecting Rights of Women and Girls","12/01/2003","(New York, December 1, 2003) — Violence and discrimination against women and girls is fueling Africa’s AIDS crisis, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today on World AIDS Day.  African governments must make gender equality a central part of national AIDS programs if they are to succeed in fighting the epidemic. The 40-page report, “Policy Paralysis: A Call for Action on HIV/AIDS-Related Human Rights Abuses Against Women and Girls in Africa,” documents human rights abuses that women and girls suffer at each stage of their lives and that increase their risk for HIV infection. Girls face sexual abuse and violence, in and out of school. Women in long-term relationships risk violence if they insist on condom use or refuse sex. Widows are discriminated against in property and inheritance rights. And women and girls are raped in war and civil conflict, where rape is used strategically as a weapon. “Women and girls in Africa are dying by the millions, partly because their second-class status makes them vulnerable to violence and unsafe sex,” said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS Program at Human Rights Watch. “In the fight against AIDS, protecting women and girls from sexual abuse and ensuring their equal rights under the law are as crucial as keeping the blood supply clean.” The report sharply criticizes governments for allowing these abuses to continue and ignoring the critical link between them and HIV/AIDS among women and girls. Legal and judicial remedies for violations of the rights of women and girls are often inadequate or nonexistent. Even where such laws exist, they are poorly enforced. Women and girls who are courageous enough to file complaints are often laughed at or mistreated by officials. “There is near paralysis in African governments’ response to HIV/AIDS among women and girls,” said Csete. “State failure to protect women and girls from such abuses is fueling the AIDS epidemic in Africa. And studies suggest that this is a global phenomenon.” Women and girls represent 58 percent of people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. In some countries, women and girls are seven times more likely to be HIV positive than their male counterparts. While Africa is the only region where females outnumber males among the newly HIV-infected, studies show that women and girls in other parts of the developing world — including the Caribbean, Central America, South Asia and Southeast Asia — have greater susceptibility to the virus as it moves from “high risk” groups to the general population. Human Rights Watch made detailed recommendations to African governments, the United Nations and donors — including the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria — to take immediate action to address gender-based violence and discrimination. Human Rights Watch called on all governments to make gender equality a central element of national AIDS programs. “Even Uganda’s widely heralded success in fighting AIDS will unravel as long as women face violence when they refuse sex or demand safer sex,” said Csete. “These abuses don’t go away by themselves; well funded programs are needed. The Global Fund and other donors should promote protection of women’s and girls’ rights as a central part of AIDS programs.” The report covers abuses in countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa: West Africa (Sierra Leone and Togo), Central Africa (Democratic Republic of Congo), East Africa (Kenya and Uganda) and Southern Africa (South Africa and Zambia). Human Rights Watch recommended that African governments take urgent action to: Enact and enforce legislation to protect women and girls from sexual and domestic violence and marital rape. Provide training and resources to police, judicial officers and other government officials to facilitate reporting and prosecution of sexual and gender-based violence to ensure that perpetrators are held accountable for their crimes. Enact and enforce legislation to ensure gender equality in property ownership, inheritance and divorce. Prohibit application of customary law or practice to undermine women’s rights to property. Abolish customary practices for widows such as “widow inheritance,” where women are “inherited” by one of their male in-laws, and ritual “cleansing,” where women may be forced to have sex with men of low social standing to cleanse them of “evil spirits.” Ensure equal access to health services and education, and take measures to protect girls from sexual violence at school.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Zambia","Children's Rights, Health, Women's Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, Sexual Violence and Rape"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/30/rebels-religion-and-oil","Rebels Religion and Oil","Rebels, Religion and Oil","","11/30/2003","It's a thirty seven-year conflict involving religion, ethnic origins, slavery and oil. But it could all be over by the end of the year. At least that's the hope of United States Secretary of State Colin Powell, who flew in to East Africa urging agreement to bring peace to Sudan.  When Sudan’s first crude oil for export poured out of the just-completed one thousand five hundred-kilometre pipeline and gushed into a supertanker at Sudan's new Red Sea port in August 1999, the Islamist-military government was elated. The civil war, in its twentieth year, had until then made the development of oil - located beneath war-torn southern swamps and savannahs - impossible. The International Monetary Fund, which suspended Sudan in 1990 for failure to pay even interest on its enormous debt, reinstated it just days before this first crude flowed.  Whatever it did for the balance of payments, oil did not bring peace. Sudan, Africa's largest country by geography and one of its poorest, has been battered by civil war for thirty seven of the forty seven years since the British left. The government - military or elected, Islamist or secular - has always belonged to a minority population, the educated Arab-speaking Muslim elite from the northern Nile Valley. Sudan's thirty five million population - sixty to seventy percent African and thirty to forty percent non-Muslim - was economically, socially and politically marginalised.  Ever since Chevron discovered substantial southern oil reserves in 1978, the impoverished African south feared the oil refinery, pipeline, port, and other infrastructure would be located in the north, and it would be cheated of its potential benefits. That is exactly what has come to pass. Now peace talks are under way in Kenya, strongly encouraged by the United States, Britain and Norway - the Troika.  It seemed for a while that oil would prolong the conflict. Indeed, in 1999, oil in the ground became the main objective of government military actions - scorched earth campaigns intended to run southern pastoralists off their land. Oil above ground became a target of sporadic rebel attacks designed to scare off foreign oil operators, as was done in 1984 with Chevron. The military did its best to create a cordon sanitaire. Hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese whose families had unsuspectingly lived with their cattle on the oilfields for centuries have been brutally displaced, without notice, hearing or compensation. Finally production began - on the military's terms.  Conveniently, the new oil revenues, soaring from $547 million in 2000 to $805 million last year, enabled the Sudanese military to purchase attack helicopters and weapons that intensified the war and expanded oil 'protection'. Up to sixty percent of the revenues went to military spending, which increased by almost fifty percent in two years. Sudan bought sixteen attack helicopters from Russia between 2001 and 2002, more than tripling its fleet.  They were often used against civilian populations. In February last year, in plain view of international food monitors, helicopters targeted a relief distribution site in the oilfields, killing seventeen civilians and wounding many more. Seven died later of their wounds.  The government claimed that the attack was a mistake, but defended its right to secure oilfield safety. This provoked its most controversial foreign investor, Talisman Energy of Canada, privately to rebuke Khartoum for linking oilfield safety and civilian deaths. Within a year, however, Talisman pulled out, giving in to an international human rights campaign.  ABUSES  Human rights groups condemned Talisman and the other foreign oil investors for their role in oil development in Sudan, whose record of gross human rights abuses intensified when the Islamist government came to power through a military coup in 1989. By 1998, when Talisman stepped in, two million Sudanese - mostly southerners - were already dead and four million displaced because of the war, not to mention war-provoked famines and epidemics.  The human rights groups claimed that foreign companies operating in the southern theatre of war exacerbated the abuses; the companies built new oilfield airstrips, bridges and roads which were promptly put to military use. Successful operations by Talisman and its partners - Petronas Nasional Berhad of Malaysia (Petronas) and the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) - produced a revenue stream that enticed the government to clear more civilians from their pastures and small sorghum fields. The pipeline attracted further companies to this new frontier, making remote fields economically viable.  As a result of the human rights drumming, Talisman sold out - not to a western oil company, but to yet another Asian state-owned oil firm, ONGC Videsh Ltd of India. Two European companies owning concessions to the south of Talisman's followed suit this year. Lundin of Sweden and OMV of Austria - a large privatising state oil firm - sold to Petronas and ONGC Videsh respectively.  Ideally, for reasons of sovereignty and national security, the nation's main natural resource should not rest so firmly in the control of three Asian state oil companies, with their own foreign policy agendas and domestic needs. But the persistent human rights campaign was an effective deterrent to other western companies considering investment.  PARIAH NO MORE  This squeeze on the fledgling oil industry coincided with serious peace talks. The government, under stringent unilateral sanctions imposed by US presidential executive order in 1997, badly wanted to improve its relationship with Washington. It sought to be promoted from the pariah status to which the US had consigned it in 1993, putting it on its list of countries supporting terrorism.  Sudan's opportunity came on September 11 2001. It promptly offered counter-terrorism cooperation with Washington, including over-flight permission, something not immediately provided by many European allies.  US State Department personnel had already been allowed in to investigate whether the terrorist training camps it harboured when Osama Bin Laden was living in Sudan from 1990 to 1996 were still in place. Although it was widely denounced, the August 1998 American cruise missile bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum softened up the Islamist government for this cooperation.  But there was a powerful new lobby in the US: the conservative religious movement took Sudan as its first foreign policy target. It railed against slavery and religious persecution of Christians. With the election of its favourite son, President George Bush, it gained a powerful ally.  Bush promptly appointed a special envoy for peace in Sudan, former senator and clergyman John Danforth. Within a year, Danforth had succeeded in moving much closer to peace than anyone thought possible.  The main parties to the war, the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), went on to agree in July last year to a referendum for southerners on self-determination. They also agreed that sharia - Islamic law - would govern the north but not the south. For the next year and a half, they slogged through many other issues, but so far have not come to a settlement on sharing power and oil revenue.  ETHNIC DIVIDE  But the government's key weapon, which gave it a toehold in the oil concession operated by Talisman on the north-south border, threatens to blow back in the face of peace. This weapon was not military but political: an ethnic divide and conquer policy in the south. The government supported a faction of the SPLM/A that split from the rebel group in 1991 along ethnic lines - part of the Nuer ethnic group which traditionally live in the oilfields. The Nuer, the second-largest southern ethnic group, took on the largest, the Dinka, which dominates the officer corps of the SPLM/A. The Nuer presence in the oilfields kept the SPLM/A out of the oil business. In this interlude, Talisman, Lundin, OMV, Petronas, CNPC and others decided to invest.  The governments success in playing the ethnic card began to break down, however. It weakened the Nuer faction by causing a proliferation of 'warlords'. Then the Sudanese military insisted on 'guarding' all the oilfields, even in home areas of ex-rebel leaders, not allowing a role for the Nuer. Finally, ordinary southerners did not even receive the crumbs of the oil business: the government allowed CNPC to bring in ten thousand Chinese labourers to build the infrastructure.  The faction leaders may have been fool enough to believe the government's promises, but they were not fool enough to miss the fact that none of them were kept.  The main Nuer faction first went on the military offensive to prevent Sudanese government troop incursions into 'their' oilfields in 1999. Lundin and OMV had to suspend operations several times, for months at a time. They did not succeed in stopping Talisman, however. After almost three years of resistance, the main Nuer faction returned to the SPLM/A.  Numerous militias remain behind, out of fear and loathing for the SPLM/A commander in chief, Colonel John Garang. They have political differences as well. Paradoxically, the militias are avowed separatists and Garang is a strong proponent of a united Sudan.  ONE COUNTRY OR TWO?  In peace talks, the Troika and the international community have supported unity. The Sudanese government prefers unity, if only because the oil lies mainly in the south. Thus the agreed referendum on southern self-determination has a long waiting period - six and a half years after signature, an aeon in politics. The internationally accepted myth is that this will give the northerners time to convince the southerners, through internationally funded development projects, that they would benefit from staying with a transformed united country and would no longer be second-class citizens.  But can a tiger change his stripes? And will his victims suddenly want to live with him? Southern popular opinion is solidly pro-independence. The war, fought mostly in the south, has left enormous death and destruction. It also led to the resurgence of slave-taking, returning to the first relationship the north had with the south in the nineteenth century.  The Troika has invested heavily in time and money in helping - or strong-arming - the parties towards an agreement. If successful, it would be a very bright spot in Bush's Africa and foreign policy.  PACT BETWEEN DICTATORS  One of the main controversies is that only the main two fighting forces are party to the talks; neither was chosen in free and failelections. Northern political parties, which repeatedly won elections in democratic times, and southern militia leaders threaten that as long as they are excluded, the agreement will be no more than a pact between 'two dictators' - which they are not obliged to recognise.  The Troika understood the downside of limiting talks to the two parties. But if the war was to end, then the principal contestants had to agree, by no means an easy task. The Troika also feared an 'open sesame' effect. Sudan is enormously diverse. Its hundreds of ethnic groups and religions cannot sit comfortably at the table, and would multiply the difficulties.  RIGHTS AND DIVERSITY  Also controversial is the absence of any provision for human rights accountability. The Troika has not made serious accountability or truth proposals, and the parties - which have terrible human rights records - do not want to end up in jail. But this would be a big step backward from other recent African agreements providing some form of justice at war's end, or at the very least, disclosure.  Indeed, one of the chief causes of the war's persistence and spread beyond the south - to central Sudan in the 1980s, the east in the 1990s, and the west this year - is that the ruling Islamist-military party does not respect diversity among Muslims and Arabs, much less the country's African majority. There are gross abuses of the rights of the majority. If the government could abandon its central programme of Islamising and Arabising the people and agree to real multi-party democracy and human rights, peace might have a chance.  That is a big if. The government recently blew its chance to show it has changed. It failed to come to peaceful agreement with the marginalised people in the western region of Darfur and is seeking a military solution to land problems instead.  Not only the government must change its stripes: the biggest challenge faced by the military-dominated SPLM/A is to convert itself into a governing political party, and allow power sharing and multi-party democracy in the south. There are hints, however, that the rebels are preparing a single-party government for the southern region, with no coalitions and no reconciliation with southern enemies, particularly the militias.  The Troika has secured the commitment of the government and SPLM/A to share positions with those not already within their ranks. After all, this is a war that no one has won militarily. While the government is astonishingly making noises about democracy, transparency and accountability, Garang has not even paid lip service to political pluralism, aside from assurances that he is 'reaching out' to other southerners. The SPLM/A shunned a church-organised south-south reconciliation meeting in late May and ignored civil society groups as well as the militias.  While the Troika has kept to the successful negotiating strategy of not breaking rank on any issue, cracks have begun to appear over the approach to southern militias. The US considers south-south politics almost byzantine. Britain, which is more capable of such analysis because of its history in Sudan, has taken a hands-off position, saying that the two parties will have to resolve these issues. But history suggests that the parties are not eager to share the spoils, particularly if they are sweetened by the greater oil production that peace offers.  The SPLM/A runs a major risk: if it does not even attempt to reconcile with the ex-rebel militia leaders entrenched in their home areas, these proud commanders will not disarm. A cut-off in government support will not immediately finish them, as Sudan is awash in weapomy - and intrigue. Hardliners in Khartoum still reject the notion of giving their long-time enemy, Garang, the post of vice-president.  The militias now insist on being called 'armed groups' rather than the derogatory term 'militias', which suggests that they are ready to make a deal, but not on their knees. The time is ripe for bold new measures, in the spirit of peacemaking and wrapping up the entire war in the south.  Until then, the militias remain a potential tool in the hands of the Islamist government awaiting its chance to undermine the peace agreement and press on with the Islamisation and Arabisation crusade. Unreconciled southern militias offer a sure-fire means of stirring up southerners to fight each other again, and thus prevent a self-determination referendum. Making sure this peace agreement is not simply another marker in a continuing war remains a major challenge.  Sudan's thirty seven-year conflict involves religion, ethnic origins, slavery, and oil, but with the peace talks underway in Kenya, the crisis might finally be over. Rone explores the crisis facing Sudan, and points out several concerns and challenges that might hinder a successful peace negotiation. It is suggested that if the Sudanese government could abandon its central program of Islamizing the people and agree to real multi-party democracy and human rights, peace might have a chance.","Africa, Sudan",""

Human Rights Watch also criticized negotiators for failing to deal directly with the pressing dangers caused by cluster munitions. After one year of negotiations, States Parties to the 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons (CCW) agreed to a new Protocol V on explosive remnants of war (ERW).  The protocol makes a state responsible for clearance of all ERW in territory under its control; it is also to provide warnings, risk education and other measures to protect the civilian population.  The user of weapons that become ERW is to provide assistance for clearance of that ERW in territory not under its control.  In essence, the new protocol extends the post-conflict requirements set forth in 1996 Amended Protocol II on landmines to all explosive remnants of war. “The new protocol should be useful in reinforcing the necessity and urgency of cleaning up the detritus of war,” said Steve Goose, director of the Arms division of Human Rights Watch.  “It is a step forward, but it falls far short of what is needed.” The protocol is replete with qualifiers and ambiguities, to the extent that its key provisions could be considered voluntary in nature.  Instead of clear cut obligations, states are to undertake actions “where feasible,” “as soon as feasible,” “where appropriate,” “to the maximum extent possible, “as far as practicable,” when “in a position to do so,” and so forth.  Moreover, most provisions apply only to ERW created in future wars, not to the huge existing ERW problem. “Because the text is so weak, the success of the protocol will depend on good will and good intentions, and on aggressive and thorough implementation by governments,” said Goose. Explosive remnants of war include all types of explosive ordnance (such as bombs, rockets, mortars, grenades, and ammunition) that have been used in an armed conflict but failed to explode as intended, thereby posing ongoing dangers.  ERW also includes abandoned explosive ordnance that has been left behind or dumped by a party to an armed conflict.       Explosive remnants of war are currently found in at least ninety-two countries, resulting in thousands of civilian casualties every year.  ERW not only pose lasting dangers to lives and limbs, they also constitute long-term impediments to economic development. Despite the urging of Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organizations (NGOs), negotiators chose not to address specifically the issue of cluster munitions.  “As the recent conflicts in Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, and Iraq have shown, cluster munitions pose unacceptable dangers to civilian populations,” said Goose.  “This is clearly the weapon category most in need of international regulation.  But governments decided to avoid the tough issue.”   Human Rights Watch and others called on CCW States Parties to agree to a mandate for negotiations on cluster munitions in 2004.  While some supported such negotiations, including Austria, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, others blocked the proposal, including China, Pakistan, Russia, and the United States.   With reluctant acquiescence from the latter, States Parties agreed to continue discussions next year on “preventive measures,” including those related to cluster munitions.     On November 13, 2003, eighty-five NGOs (including Human Rights Watch) from nearly fifty countries launched the Cluster Munition Coalition.  The coalition calls for no use of cluster munitions until their humanitarian problems have been resolved.   States Parties also agreed to continue work on the issue of antivehicle mines next year, based primarily on a proposal put forward by the United States.  The ERW negotiations were led by Ambassador Chris Sanders of the Netherlands.  Each State Party must now formally ratify the ERW protocol according to its domestic procedures.  A total of twenty ratifications are required before the new protocol becomes legally binding international law.","Global","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/27/cote-divoire-militias-commit-abuses-impunity","Cte dIvoire- Militias Commit Abuses With Impunity","Côte d’Ivoire: Militias Commit Abuses With Impunity","","11/27/2003","(New York) - Pro-government militias in Côte d'Ivoire are committing serious abuses against civilians, including killings and torture, Human Rights Watch said today. The Ivorian government and international peacekeeping forces must take steps to control the rise of these militias, which operate with impunity.   In a visit to Côte d'Ivoire in October, Human Rights Watch received many credible accounts that armed groups-which the official security forces allowed to act with impunity-had carried out serious abuses against civilians in government-controlled parts of the country. These abuses, which included killings, torture and assaults, have continued since the nominal end in July of the civil conflict that had broken out in September 2002.   """"The proliferation of militia groups is a very dangerous consequence of the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire, particularly in the currently volatile situation,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division. """"Unfortunately, the government has not acted to stem this trend. Instead, these groups continue to get away with murder.""""   The reports received by Human Rights Watch indicate that in the west and southwest of the country these government-supported militias have harassed and assaulted peasant farmers, many of whom are migrants from other West African countries, including Burkina Faso. Most of the militia members are Bété-the same ethnic group of the Ivorian president, Laurent Gbagbo-or are from groups related to the Bété. Over the past 10 months, thousands of farmers who had migrated from Burkina Faso have been forced from their homes around Toulepleu, in western Côte d'Ivoire. In late October, several hundred West African immigrants and Ivorians of the Baoulé ethnic group were chased off their lands around Gagnoa, in southern Côte d'Ivoire, reportedly by groups of Bété youths. Militia groups supporting the government also remain active in the Ivorian capital, Abidjan.   Pro-government militia groups, known as the """"Young Patriots"""" (Jeunes Patriotes), have proliferated in Côte d'Ivoire over the past 14 months. Membership is believed to number in the thousands, although precise figures are unknown. Several of the leaders of the umbrella group-the Group of Patriots for Peace (Groupement des Patriotes pour la Paix, or GPP)-are ex-student leaders from a national university students association, the Student and School Federation of Côte d'Ivoire (Fédération Estudiantine et Scolaire de Côte d'Ivoire, or FESCI). They appear to have built up membership from the student network and the youth wings of political parties, particularly the Ivorian Popular Front (Front Populaire Ivoirien, or FPI), the ruling party. Student activists have also played a prominent role in the rebel movement and within other major political parties.   Several of the militia units-known by names like the Bees, the Gazelles, the Ninjas and the Panthers-have reportedly received support in their training exercises from members of the national armed forces. There are also credible allegations that some of the militia members, particularly those of Bété ethnicity, have been armed by government forces. As recently as October, militia members attacked water and electricity companies in Abidjan, allegedly for providing services to the rebel-held northern part of the country. In late October, they attacked newspaper distributors and kiosks selling newspapers linked to opposition parties, temporarily shutting down press circulation.   Since the end of the conflict in July, and as recently as this month, Human Rights Watch has continued to receive reports of torture, arbitrary detentions and """"disappearances"""" perpetrated by members of the state security forces in Abidjan.   In northern Côte d'Ivoire, controlled by the rebel New Forces (Forces Nouvelles), in recent months there has been an upsurge in reported incidents of assault, rape and looting allegedly carried out by undisciplined armed elements linked to the rebels. Many members of the New Forces have not been paid since the war was officially declared over.   Human Rights Watch called on the government to launch an inquiry into the role of militias in abuses against civilians and the role of the security forces in supporting or failing to halt the militias' activities. President Gbagbo should take steps to ensure that no party or government funding is directed towards such militias, which should immediately be disbanded. The government should act to bring to justice individuals suspected of involvement in these abuses.   """"The conflict in Côte d'Ivoire is partly a product of longstanding impunity in the country. Solving this political impasse requires not only serious engagement by the international community but also a real commitment from all the opposing groups to end abuses,"""" said Takirambudde.   The United Nations Mission in Côte d'Ivoire (MINUCI) should also speed up the countrywide deployment of human rights officers so that they can monitor and conduct their own investigations into these abuses. In addition, Human Rights Watch urged France and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to ensure protection of civilians through extensive deployment of their peacekeeping forces in areas of concern.   Background   Côte d'Ivoire's nine-month civil war began with a rebel uprising in September 2002, and was officially declared over in July. But the implementation of the French-brokered Linas-Marcoussis peace agreement, which called for a transitional government and elections in 2005, has all but broken down. In September, the rebel New Forces walked out of the government of national reconciliation, citing the government's failure to implement the agreement in good faith.   Urban and rural militias played an increasingly active role following the outbreak of hostilities in the civil war: civilian militias manned checkpoints on main roads in government-controlled areas, checked civilian identification, and generally took on tasks usually carried out by uniformed government security forces. In Duékoué, in the west of the country, Human Rights Watch documented executions and harassment of civilians in April by civilian militias acting with full impunity and, in some cases, with the collaboration of state security forces. In Abidjan, militia activity brought the town to a standstill during the militias' demonstrations against the peace accords in January. During those demonstrations, pro-government militias attacked French businesses and institutions with no response from the state security forces.   While a ceasefire, monitored by 5,300 peacekeepers from France and ECOWAS, is still holding, there are worrying signs that the two sides are again preparing for war. Militias would likely play a large part in any return to violence. ECOWAS-sponsored talks aimed at breaking the impasse were held earlier this month, but failed to bring the rebels back into the government of national reconciliation. At present, the country remains split in two, with the rebel forces controlling the northern part and the government holding the south.   Crucial provisions in the January peace accords provided for a national human rights commission and an international inquiry into abuses committed during the conflict. To date, neither the commission nor the inquiry has materialized. Other key provisions of the peace agreement-including those on disarmament, land reform and nationality law-remain unfulfilled.   Impunity by government security forces remains a fundamental concern in Côte d'Ivoire and is both a cause and a result of the disintegration of the rule of law over the past four years.   Since 2000, Human Rights Watch and other human rights organizations have documented a persistent pattern of serious human rights violations committed by state security forces alone or in complicity with civilian militias, none of which have been seriously investigated or prosecuted by the Ivorian government. During the violence surrounding the presidential and parliamentary elections in 2000, there were scores of extrajudicial executions as well as numerous disappearances, cases of sexual violence, and hundreds of cases of torture committed by government forces, often in collaboration with youth supporters of the ruling party, the Ivorian Popular Front.   Human Rights Watch documented similar patterns of abuses against northern Ivorians, foreigners and suspected rebel sympathizers since the outbreak of the internal conflict on September 19, 2002. These violations included systematic and indiscriminate attacks on civilians, summary executions, arbitrary arrest and detention, """"disappearances"""", torture, rape, pillage, corporal punishment and other violent acts against civilians.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire",""

In view of your stated personal commitment to values of good governance and human rights, and in view of Nigeria's importance and influence within the Commonwealth and within Africa, Nigeria has a critical role to play in ensuring that these issues are fully addressed.   The Commonwealth has a proud record of promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Abuja next week - which will focus on the theme of Democracy and Development - will, however, present an important test of these commitments. This letter outlines a number of critical areas of concern, including political and human rights developments in Zimbabwe, Pakistan, and Nigeria itself, the question of justice for past abuses in Sierra Leone, and the global problems of small arms and HIV/AIDS.   The failure of the Commonwealth to address continued serious human rights problems in many of its member countries make a mockery of the 1991 Harare Declaration and point to institutional weaknesses in the Commonwealth's capacity to promote and protect human rights. We urge you to support the Commonwealth to address this gap by creating a High Commissioner or Special Representative of the Commonwealth Secretary-General for Human Rights. This high level post could act as a focal point for the Commonwealth's human rights agenda, make country visits and public reports and recommendations to governments and, where necessary, refer country situations for further action by the Commonwealth's political bodies. With appropriate resources and independence, this post would provide a closer institutional link between the Commonwealth and the broader United Nations human rights system.   Furthermore, to deal with the most serious and protracted human rights situations, the Commonwealth should expand the mandate of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to address human rights concerns as well as political and constitutional issues. In situations such as Zimbabwe or Pakistan, CMAG could play a useful role in setting benchmarks for human rights improvements and ensuring human rights concerns are fully integrated into the Commonwealth's political actions.   Nigeria   During your tenure as president, you have been a leading regional voice on the importance of human rights and good governance, for instance in promoting the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad). But these values are still not implemented for most ordinary Nigerians, and human rights abuses continue to impede any progress towards the establishment of accountable government and the rule of law in Nigeria.   Much attention will be focused during the CHOGM on developments in Zimbabwe and Pakistan, both of which remain suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth for their violations of human rights and democratic process. However, the current situation in your own country, which is hosting the CHOGM, will also be in the spotlight.   Although there have been some improvements in the human rights situation in Nigeria since you were elected in 1999, the Nigerian government has been responsible for serious human rights abuses, as described in previous correspondence with you. These include the massacre of hundreds of people by the military in Odi, Bayelsa State, in 1999, and in Benue State, in 2001, for which no one has yet been brought to justice. The portrayal of the """"Miss World riots"""" in Kaduna in July 2002 as religious violence concealed the fact that the Nigerian security forces committed dozens of unlawful killings under cover of these disturbances, as documented in Human Rights Watch's July 2003 report, """"The Miss World Riots: Continued Impunity for Killings in Kaduna.""""   The April and May 2003 elections, which returned you to office for a second term and secured an overwhelming victory for the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), were marred by violence and intimidation, as well as widespread rigging. Scores of people were killed and many more injured, especially in the south and southeast. Much of this violence was carried out by supporters of the PDP, and few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice.   In the attached report, """"Nigeria: Renewed Crackdown on Freedom of Expression,"""" due for publication on December 2, Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases in 2002 and 2003 in which journalists, human rights activists, opposition party members and peaceful demonstrators have faced arrest, detention, ill-treatment and other forms of intimidation simply because they have criticized government policies. For example, several journalists covering massive public protests earlier this year over an increase in the price of fuel were severely beaten by the police. Around thirty protestors who peacefully demonstrated against US President Bush's visit to Nigeria in July were arrested and several of them were tortured on the orders of senior police officials. As recently as November 2003, public processions by Ogoni activists commemorating the execution of Ogoni leader Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others in 1995 were disrupted by the police. In Bonny, the police arrested seventeen Ogoni activists, several of whom stated that they were beaten by the police; they are now facing charges of unlawful procession and conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace. More than twenty other Ogoni activists were arrested in Port Harcourt after taking part in a commemorative vigil. We are also deeply concerned that leaders of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) have received personal death threats in recent weeks.   The Nigerian government should take action on these issues and end the impunity which is protecting those responsible for serious human rights abuses. We urge you to provide Commonwealth leaders with a detailed progress report on the investigation and prosecution of the cases mentioned above.   Human Rights Watch is also appealing to the Commonwealth Heads of Government to use its meetings with you to press for an end to impunity and for institutional human rights reforms in Nigeria. The failure of Commonwealth members to speak out on such abuses to date leaves the organization open to accusations of double-standards and undermines the effectiveness of Commonwealth actions on situations like those in Zimbabwe and Pakistan.   Ending impunity for Charles Taylor and Sierra Leone   Nigeria and its Commonwealth partners have an important responsibility to fight against impunity for those responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Commonwealth has been strong in its support for the new International Criminal Court. The Commonwealth has also lent support to international efforts to ensure justice for past crimes in Sierra Leone, for instance by nominating judges to serve on the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In his report to your meeting, the Commonwealth Secretary General stresses the importance of """"international efforts to end impunity and to bring to justice those responsible for heinous crimes.""""   It is unacceptable, therefore, that Nigeria should continue to shield from prosecution Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor who has been charged by the Special Court for Sierra Leone with crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law for his role in Sierra Leone's civil war. It is unprecedented that one member of the Commonwealth should host someone indicted for war crimes in another Commonwealth country. Nigeria played a helpful role in support of Liberia's political transition, and arranging Taylor's safe passage from the country was a contribution to that process, but you now have an obligation to help bring Taylor to justice.   Over the past decade, decisions by the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and statements by United Nations bodies have consolidated the strong trend against impunity for perpetrators of serious international crimes. As a state party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Nigeria has undertaken legal obligations to cooperate with efforts to bring those who commit serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law to justice. As a result, Nigeria is well placed to react positively to the UN Security Council request of May 2003 that states cooperate with the Sierra Leone Special Court.   Taylor's presence in Nigeria is an affront to his victims in Sierra Leone and an ongoing source of insecurity in the region. It should also be an embarrassment to Commonwealth leaders gathering in Abuja at this time. We urge you to resolve this issue ahead of the Abuja meeting by transferring Taylor immediately to the Special Court for Sierra Leone.   Zimbabwe and Pakistan   The human rights situation in Zimbabwe has continued to deteriorate since the Commonwealth's last interventions. High levels of political violence against opposition supporters continue. Rallies by human rights and civil society groups such as the National Constitutional Assembly are routinely disrupted. Peaceful protestors have been detained under both colonial-era and newly created laws restricting freedom of expression, assembly and association. In September, the government closed The Daily News, Zimbabwe's last remaining independent daily newspaper, despite a court order that the paper should be granted an operating license. No independent broadcast media are permitted to operate inside the country. The food situation remains critical, but relief efforts have been undermined by corruption, profiteering and a high degree of politicization by the authorities.   In Pakistan, too, there has been little progress towards greater respect for human rights and the restoration of genuine civilian political authority. In the four years since the coup that brought him to power, President Musharraf has suppressed civil liberties and progressively undermined civilian institutions in the country. Members of the political opposition and former government officials have been harassed, threatened and arbitrarily detained. Independent judges have been removed from the courts. Anti-government public rallies and demonstrations have been banned, rendering political parties all but powerless. Far-reaching amendments to the constitution have dramatically strengthened the power of the presidency, formalized the role of the army in governance, and diminished the authority of elected representatives.   Zimbabwe and Pakistan should remain suspended from the Commonwealth until there are fundamental improvements in the human rights situation. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group should be asked to review the human rights situation in both countries (as well as political and constitutional issues), establish clear benchmarks for improvements, and identify new strategies to promote change. Commonwealth members should also ensure both countries are not re-elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights unless substantial progress is made (Pakistan will need to seek re-election in 2004 and Zimbabwe in 2005).   Human Rights Watch also wishes to highlight several other issues of critical concern for sustainable development on which the Commonwealth can play an important role.   Small arms   The widespread availability and misuse of small arms gravely undermines key Commonwealth priorities, including human rights, democracy, people-centered development, and conflict prevention and resolution in many Commonwealth countries. At the 1999 CHOGM in Durban, Commonwealth leaders expressed concern about the uncontrolled flows of such weapons, as well as their excessive and destabilizing accumulation. Since then the issue has been taken up in a United Nations conference in 2001 and in a biennial review in 2003. Much focus has been on illicit trafficking in small arms, leaving aside their irresponsible transfer and misuse by governments. It is thus no surprise that to date little real progress has been made to alleviate the human impacts of the scourge of small arms.   Commonwealth countries, given their commitment to promote human rights, are in a position to help focus the debate on what governments can do to halt and prevent the misuse of small arms. In particular, the Abuja meeting offers an opportunity for Commonwealth leaders to promote the principle that no government should misuse small arms nor authorize arms transfers to human rights abusers. They should pledge to fulfill existing government responsibilities to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law, including by ensuring that police and armed forces strictly uphold international standards on the use of force and firearms.   Commonwealth leaders should also end arms flows to human rights abusers, both internationally and within their own borders. With respect to international transfers, Commonwealth countries should comply fully with the provisions of all applicable instruments defining minimum export criteria, such as the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, as well as the measures of restraint agreed upon in other fora, such as the Economic Community of West African States' moratorium on the import, export, and manufacture of small arms. Commonwealth member governments and the Commonwealth itself should adopt - and make binding - strict arms trade criteria on the observance of human rights and compliance with international humanitarian law. They should also pledge support for a binding international instrument on arms transfers that contains strong human rights and humanitarian criteria, such as the proposed international Arms Trade Treaty. These steps would give further concrete meaning to the 1991 Harare Declaration, in which Commonwealth countries pledged to """"support United Nations and other international institutions in the world's search for peace, disarmament and effective arms control.""""   Gender issues and HIV/AIDS   In keeping with the Commonwealth's strong commitment to women's human rights and women's empowerment within development processes, we urge you to encourage Commonwealth member states to prioritize women's equality within their HIV/AIDS programming.   The deadly link between women's rights abuses and the spread of HIV/AIDS is slowly gaining recognition, but not before millions of women's lives were claimed by the disease. Every day, in every corner of the world, women and girls are beaten in their homes, trafficked into forced prostitution, raped by soldiers and rebels in armed conflicts, sexually abused by their """"caretakers,"""" deprived equal rights to property and other economic assets, assaulted for defying gender norms, and often left with no option but to trade sex for survival. Evidence indicates that women especially at risk are those in a heterosexual marriage or long-term union in a society where men commonly engage in sex outside the union and women confront abuse if they demand condom use. Some women are """"inherited"""" by male in-laws when they become widows, often becoming wives in polygamous families. These acts of discrimination and violence are conduits for HIV infection. Relative to the scale and severity of these abuses, laws, policies, and programs to combat HIV/AIDS by protecting women's rights are negligible.   The relationship between abuses of women's rights and their vulnerability to AIDS is acutely clear in Africa, where 58 percent of those infected with HIV are women. Infection rates among adolescent girls and young women in much of Africa are strikingly higher than those of their male counterparts, exposing the disturbing reality that young women face appalling levels of abuse and discrimination.   Human Rights Watch has recently documented a range of women's rights abuses and how they play a role in women's risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in Africa. For example, in Uganda, we documented how domestic violence prevents women from freely accessing HIV/AIDS information, from negotiating condom use, and from resisting unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, yet the government has failed to take any meaningful steps to prevent and punish such abuse. In Kenya, simply because of their gender, many women AIDS victims sink into poverty and will die even sooner because customs condone evicting women from their homes and taking their property upon their husband's death. In Zambia, orphan girls are often sexually abused at the hands of their guardians, including family members and teachers. In South Africa, the government is lagging in its commitment to provide post-exposure prophylaxis to rape survivors, and girls are deterred from attending school because of high rates of sexual violence and harassment. These issues and more are highlighted in an upcoming Human Rights Watch report entitled """"Policy Paralysis: A Call for Action on HIV/AIDS-Related Human Rights Abuses against Women and Girls in Africa,"""" which will be released in December 2003.   We hope you will urge all Commonwealth member states, and particularly those in Africa, to combat the pervasive discrimination and violence against women and girls that exacerbate the threat of HIV/AIDS.   Business and Human Rights   The Commonwealth Business Council (CBC) has been involved in initiatives to improve corporate governance, reduce corruption, and promote responsible foreign direct investment in developing countries. The CBC has supported the British government's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Human Rights Watch believes that the Commonwealth, through the CBC and otherwise, should help strengthen the EITI and similar transparency initiatives by 1) supporting the idea of compulsory reporting of their payments to governments by companies working in the extractive sector and by 2) providing technical assistance to both companies and governments on how to ensure that this information is meaningful. Nigeria has already set a useful precedent when you agreed to publish their revenues and authorize companies to publish payments in November; we now urge you to take this forward.   Human Rights Watch wishes you a very successful meeting and looks forward to continued dialogue on these important issues.

The danger now is that governments in Central Asia and the Caucasus may step up political repression to head off a similar scenario. In Georgia, the savvy political opposition refused to swallow a blatantly rigged election. Although many Western observers still link former President Eduard Shevardnadze with the liberal reforms he defended so staunchly as Soviet foreign minister, he ran an abusive and corrupt government in Tbilisi and had become increasingly unpopular. Yet Shevarnadze had allowed enough political reform to enable a free news media to flourish - the constant television coverage of the election protests and the vote fraud kept the public aware and concerned. By contrast, the Azerbaijani government tightly controlled coverage of the fraudulent presidential elections last month. The governments in the region have spared little effort to prevent the emergence of popular, dynamic opposition movements and presidential candidates. In Kazakhstan, the government sensed a threat to its unrivaled power in the rising popularity of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan, led by a governor and a former energy minister. Both men were imprisoned and the political party was not allowed to register. In Kyrgyzstan, the president's main political rival has been in jail since 2000. It is difficult to find a single country in Central Asia and the Caucasus where the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that national elections met international standards. In some countries, like Uzbekistan, the government simply doesn't tolerate any opposition political parties at all. Uzbek elections are such empty exercises that the OSCE doesn't bother to monitor them. Now these governments are facing new elections. Kazakhstan will have parliamentary elections in 2004, and Kyrgyzstan will hold presidential elections in 2005. Fearing a Georgian-style """"velvet revolution,"""" they may postpone political reform and crack down harder on opposition movements. They may bring out the troops on election day, as the Azerbaijani government did, to prevent peaceful protest from developing into anything more. These governments are new allies of the United States, both in its global campaign against terrorism and its determination to find alternatives to Middle East energy dependence. Washington has pressed for free and fair elections in the region. But too often, it has exerted little effective pressure on governments that resist democratic change. This was not the case in Georgia. The Bush administration dispatched senior envoys to seek early assurances that the vote would be free and fair. Washington also spoke out strongly in protest of the fraud. This effort helped the democratic opposition to cast the government's actions as illegitimate, paving the way for a peaceful transition. In contrast, Washington was blasé before recent elections in Azerbaijan, even though the government used every trick in the book to manipulate the process. Only in the final days before the vote, when the Bush administration feared that violence would break out, did it begin to issue sharp statements. As these countries enter into new election cycles, America should learn the lessons of Georgia. It should make clear what will constitute a free and fair vote. It should also make clear the diplomatic and financial consequences of a rigged vote. In Kyrgyzstan, it should insist on the release of Felix Kulov, President Askar Akaev's main rival. In Kazakhstan, it should insist on the registration of the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan. It should always insist that electoral commissions be balanced, and that domestic monitors be allowed to monitor the vote and the tally process. Nor should the administration give up on Azerbaijan. International experts should be appointed to what is now a domestic commission of inquiry into the election fraud. The commission will need overt international support in order to do its work. Georgia still faces enormous challenges to achieve democratic government, not least from separatist movements across its mountainous territory. Bringing good governance to the rest of the region is a far greater challenge, whose time has come.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan","Press Freedom"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/26/indonesia-media-under-attack-aceh","Indonesia- Media Under Attack in Aceh","Indonesia: Media Under Attack in Aceh","","11/26/2003","(New York) — The Indonesian government has blocked Indonesian and foreign correspondents from covering the military campaign in Aceh, where gross human rights violations are taking place, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today. Indonesia’s security forces and separatist guerrillas have intimidated journalists in the northwestern province. The 33-page report, “Aceh Under Martial Law: Muzzling the Messengers: Attacks and Restrictions on the Media,” documents violations of press freedom in Aceh after the Indonesian government on May 19 declared a state of military emergency in the province and renewed its war there against the armed, separatist Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka, or GAM). On November 6 the government extended martial law in Aceh, due to expire November 19, for another six months. “Whenever the press has pulled away the shroud of secrecy around Aceh, it has exposed serious abuses,” said Saman Zia-Zarifi, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “As the government intensifies its military campaign, press access to Aceh becomes even more crucial for providing information on how civilians are surviving the war.” Reports from Aceh in June and July highlighted several instances of executions of civilians by the Indonesian military, widespread displacement of civilians, and a lack of basic necessities such as food, healthcare and access to education. Since martial law began, Indonesian security forces have verbally and physically intimidated journalists in Aceh. Military officials have also arbitrarily detained correspondents in the field. In one widely reported case, members of Indonesia´s elite special forces, Kopassus, on July 4 beat an Indonesian radio journalist who was reporting on the plight of Acehnese civilians fleeing the military campaign. Human Rights Watch stated that GAM had intimidated journalists. GAM has abducted two reporters on June 29 and has refused to release them. Even while riding in clearly marked press vehicles in Aceh, numerous journalists have also been shot at by unknown gunmen. “The Indonesian government has claimed that it is protecting journalists by barring them from Aceh, but its actions show that it is more concerned about hiding what the troops are doing,” Zia-Zarifi said. “In Aceh a free and safe press is crucial to provide some accountability for violations by the Indonesian military and GAM.” The Indonesian government has severely restricted access to Aceh for foreign correspondents through a series of regulatory measures issued since June. Pressure on Indonesian reporters has also resulted in self-censorship among Indonesia´s press corps, ensuring an absence of critical reporting on the conflict. The government has denied access to Aceh to diplomats, independent international observers and international human rights organizations. It has blocked the United Nations and nongovernmental humanitarian agencies from working in the province. The current Indonesian military offensive in Aceh began on May 19 after a six-month ceasefire failed to resolve the longstanding conflict in the province. The Aceh offensive is Indonesia´s largest military campaign since the country´s invasion of East Timor in 1975. The operation involves an estimated 30,000 troops, who are opposed by approximately 5,000 armed members of GAM.","Asia, Indonesia",""

More than a dozen ethnic Uighur separatists were apprehended in Afghanistan and transferred to the U.S. military detention facility at Guantánamo Bay in Cuba. They were reportedly training in Afghanistan with Uighur groups seeking independence or greater autonomy from China for the northwestern province of Xinjiang. China has a long and well-documented history of repression of the Uighurs, a Muslim, Turkic-speaking community. The government has systematically tortured and otherwise mistreated suspected separatists. The death penalty has been used against those found guilty of separatist activities after trials that do not meet international fair trial standards. Annual U.S. State Department human rights reports have consistently and strongly criticized China for the mistreatment of ethnic Uighurs. Reflecting these concerns, the United States has urged China to allow the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit China and have access to its prisons and other places of detention. “The United States should not even contemplate returning ethnic Uighurs to China,” said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “Any assurances from China that it will not mistreat returnees would not be worth the paper they are written on. It would be impossible for the United States to prevent mistreatment of these detainees once they fall into China’s abysmal prison system.” While insisting that the United States should not return Uighurs to China, Human Rights Watch reiterated its longstanding objection to the practice of detaining individuals indefinitely without charges at Guantánamo in violation of international human rights law and international humanitarian law. Persons for whom there is no legal basis to detain must be released to countries where they will not face torture or mistreatment. The problems of rendition of suspects to countries that routinely practice torture was highlighted by the case of Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, who was transferred by the United States to Syria after being detained in New York. On November 4, Arar publicly asserted that while held in Syrian prisons for ten months he was repeatedly tortured by being whipped with a thick electric cable and threatened with electric shocks. The United States claimed that it had received assurances from Syria that Arar would not be mistreated. “As with Arar and Syria, it is a fallacy to believe that a state that systematically practices torture will magically transform itself simply because it has offered diplomatic assurances,” said Adams. “It would be extremely reckless to accept written assurances from China in these cases. If these men are returned and anything happens to them, it will be the responsibility of the United States.” Expelling, returning or extraditing a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be subjected to torture is a violation of the Convention against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty that the United States ratified in 1994. The Bush Administration has acknowledged this obligation, and asserts it does not render suspects if it believes it is likely that they will be tortured. On June 25, the U.S. Defense Department General Counsel, William Haynes, wrote to U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy: “Should an individual be transferred to another country to be held on behalf of the United States, or should we otherwise deem it appropriate, United States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the receiving country that it will not torture the individual being transferred to that country. We can assure you that the United States would take steps to investigate credible allegations of torture and take appropriate action if there were reason to believe that those assurances were not being honored.” The United States apparently is considering sending the Uighurs to China because it believes they do not constitute a threat to the United States and presumably have committed no crimes. Yet it is reportedly insisting that those released be investigated and imprisoned upon repatriation. “The United States operates a system in Guantánamo in which detainees are held without charges and without access to lawyers or family members,” said Adams. “It now proposes to compound this travesty of justice by sending these men to a country in which the presumption of innocence is routinely turned on its head.” Human Rights Watch urged the Bush Administration to institute a moratorium on the rendition of persons to countries that routinely use torture until it has undertaken a broader review of the U.S. practice with regard to renditions. The review must examine the nature of the assurances the United States receives from countries prior to transfer, the steps it takes to ensure persons are not abused after rendition, and the actual fate of those who have been turned over to countries known to practice torture. Before it lifts the moratorium, the United States must also ensure that its own practices are consistent with U.S. and international law, and that procedures are in place to protect transferred detainees from being subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The potential return of Uighurs to China is particularly worrisome given the longstanding, highly emotional situation in Xinjiang. Armed Uighur groups have bombed and attacked Chinese government and military targets. Human Rights Watch has condemned separatist violence, as well as the systematic repression by China against Uighurs and Muslims in Xinjiang. China has opportunistically used the international “war on terror” to conflate armed separatists with those advocating peaceful efforts to obtain independence or greater autonomy.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture, Guantanamo"

A judge in Guerrero today issued an arrest warrant for a former member of the judicial police who is charged with allegedly participating in the forced disappearance of one of the hundreds of people who were """"disappeared"""" in the state of Guerrero in the 1970s. The arrest will be the first to be carried out by the special prosecutor that Mexican President Vicente Fox appointed in November 2001 to investigate and prosecute human rights violations committed under previous governments. """"This arrest marks an important break from three decades of impunity for some of the worst human rights violations in Mexico,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"After two years of investigating these crimes, the special prosecutor will now begin to prosecute them."""" The pending arrest comes in the wake of a landmark Supreme Court ruling earlier this month that overturned a federal judge's decision to reject the special prosecutor's sole previous request for arrest warrants. A unanimous court disagreed with the judge's contention that the time allotted by the statute of limitations for the crime had expired. The court found instead that the statute of limitations on abduction does not begin to run if the victim's body remains missing. The Supreme Court's ruling opened the possibility for the prosecution of former officials allegedly implicated in the kidnapping of leftist activists in the 1970s. More arrests are expected in the coming weeks. The Fox administration has repeatedly expressed its commitment to end the climate of impunity that allowed egregious human rights violations to go unpunished in Mexico. In July, Human Rights Watch released a report, """"Justice in Jeopardy,"""" that showed how the functioning of the Special Prosecutor's Office has been seriously undermined by a lack of resources, limited access to declassified documents, and a lack of cooperation by the military. Since the report's release, some of these shortcomings have been addressed. Human Rights Watch notes that further steps are needed to shore up the work of the Special Prosecutor's Office. The Mexican government should improve access to declassified documents by indexing the archives in which they are held. The authorities should also ensure that these documents are not managed by officials with potential links to persons under criminal investigation.

The human rights dialogues are usually held twice a year, with one in Europe and one in Beijing, sometimes in conjunction with a side trip to a specific region such as Tibet. Neither side releases information about the agenda or the outcome of the talks. “For all the talk, the same human rights violations are continually occurring in China,” said Lotte Leicht, Brussels Director for Human Rights Watch. “If these talks are to have any credibility, it’s necessary that they establish transparent and measurable benchmarks to measure any progress on China’s part. More of the same would be tantamount to doing nothing.” Human Rights Watch reminded the European Union that its own Guidelines on Human Rights Dialogues call for establishing the “criteria for measuring the progress achieved … and also criteria for a possible exit strategy.” Human Rights Watch recommended seven issues that the dialogues should consider and recommended benchmarks for measuring progress. It asked for: abolition of all forms of administrative detention, including reeducation through labor; removal of government controls on Tibetan religious organization, activity and belief; abolition of the “Strike Hard” anti-crime campaign, which significantly speeds up the judicial process at the expense of fundamental due process and the right to a fair trial; enactment of a national law prohibiting discrimination against persons with HIV/AIDS; revocation of China’s reservation to Article 8(1)(a) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which grants workers the right to form independent trade unions; ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and open invitations to all U.N. special rapporteurs and working groups.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, China and Tibet",""

The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in Abuja, Nigeria next month - which will focus on the theme of Democracy and Development - will, however, present an important test of these commitments. This letter outlines a number of critical areas of concern, including political developments in Zimbabwe, Pakistan and Nigeria itself, the question of justice for past abuses in Sierra Leone, and the global problems of small arms and HIV/AIDS.   The continued serious human rights problems in many Commonwealth countries make a mockery of the 1991 Harare Declaration and point to institutional weaknesses in the Commonwealth's capacity to promote and protect human rights. The Commonwealth should address this gap by creating a High Commissioner or Special Representative of the Commonwealth Secretary-General for Human Rights. This high level post could act as a focal point for the Commonwealth's human rights agenda, make country visits and public reports and recommendations to governments and, where necessary, refer country situations for further action by the Commonwealth's political bodies. With appropriate resources and independence, this post would provide a closer institutional link between the Commonwealth and the broader United Nations human rights system.   Furthermore, to deal with the most serious and protracted human rights situations, the Commonwealth should expand the mandate of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) to address human rights concerns as well as political and constitutional issues. In situations such as Zimbabwe or Pakistan, CMAG could play a useful role in setting benchmarks for human rights improvements and ensuring human rights concerns are fully integrated into the Commonwealth's political actions.   Nigeria   Much attention will be focused in Abuja on developments in Zimbabwe and Pakistan, both of which remain suspended from the councils of the Commonwealth for their violations of human rights and democratic process. But Commonwealth leaders should also pay close attention to similar problems in the host country Nigeria and use the opportunity presented by the Abuja meeting to press President Obasanjo for meaningful reform.   President Obasanjo has been a leading regional voice on the importance of human rights and good governance, for instance in promoting the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad). But the values that President Obasanjo champions publicly are still beyond the reach of most ordinary Nigerians, and human rights abuses continue to impede any progress towards the establishment of accountable government and the rule of law.   Although there have been improvements in the overall human rights situation in Nigeria since President Obasanjo was elected in 1999, his government has been responsible for serious human rights abuses, including the massacre of hundreds of people by the military in Odi, Bayelsa State, in 1999, and in Benue State, in 2001, for which no one has yet been brought to justice. The portrayal of the """"Miss World riots"""" in Kaduna in July 2002 as religious violence concealed the fact that the Nigerian security forces committed dozens of unlawful killings under cover of these disturbances, as documented in Human Rights Watch's July 2003 report """"The Miss World Riots: Continued Impunity for Killing in Kaduna.""""   The April 2003 elections, which returned President Obansanjo to office for a second term, were marred by violence and intimidation as well as widespread rigging. Scores of people were killed and many more injured, especially in the south and southeast. Much of this violence was carried out by supporters of the ruling party, and few of the perpetrators have been brought to justice. In contrast with the public outcry over the elections in Zimbabwe or Pakistan, many Commonwealth countries largely remained silent about Nigeria's electoral violence and fraud.   In a forthcoming report entitled """"Nigeria: Crackdown on Freedom of Expression,"""" due for release this December, Human Rights Watch has documented a renewed crackdown on freedom of expression in Nigeria. During 2003, journalists, human rights activists, opposition party members and peaceful demonstrators have faced arrest, detention, ill-treatment and other forms of intimidation simply because they have criticized government policies. For example, several journalists covering massive public protests earlier this year over an increase in the price of fuel were severely beaten by the police. Around thirty protestors who peacefully demonstrated against US President Bush's visit to Nigeria in July were arrested and several of them were tortured on the orders of senior police officials.   The failure of Commonwealth members to speak out on these abuses leaves the organization open to accusations of double-standards and undermines the effectiveness of Commonwealth actions on situations like those in Zimbabwe and Pakistan. The Commonwealth Heads of Government should use its meetings with President Obasanjo to press for an end to impunity and for institutional human rights reforms. We urge you to seek a detailed progress report from President Obasanjo on the investigation and prosecution of the cases mentioned above.   Zimbabwe and Pakistan   The human rights situation in Zimbabwe has continued to deteriorate since the Commonwealth's last interventions. High levels of political violence against opposition supporters continue. Rallies by human rights and civil society groups such as the National Constitutional Assembly are routinely disrupted. Peaceful protestors have been detained under both colonial-era and newly created laws restricting freedom of expression, assembly and association. In September, the government closed The Daily News, Zimbabwe's last remaining independent daily newspaper, despite a court order that the paper should be granted an operating license. No independent broadcast media are permitted to operate inside the country. The food situation remains critical, but relief efforts have been undermined by corruption, profiteering and a high degree of politicization by the authorities.   In Pakistan, too, there has been little progress towards greater respect for human rights and the restoration of genuine civilian political authority. In the four years since the coup that brought him to power, President Musharraf has suppressed civil liberties and progressively undermined civilian institutions in the country. Members of the political opposition and former government officials have been harassed, threatened and arbitrarily detained. Independent judges have been removed from the courts. Anti-government public rallies and demonstrations have been banned, rendering political parties all but powerless. Far-reaching amendments to the constitution have dramatically strengthened the power of the presidency, formalized the role of the army in governance, and diminished the authority of elected representatives.   Zimbabwe and Pakistan should remain suspended from the Commonwealth until there are fundamental improvements in the human rights situation. The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group should be asked to review the human rights situation in both countries (as well as political and constitutional issues), establish clear benchmarks for improvements, and identify new strategies to promote change. Commonwealth members should also ensure that both countries are not re-elected to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights unless substantial progress is made (Pakistan will need to seek re-election in 2004 and Zimbabwe in 2005).   Charles Taylor and Sierra Leone   Nigeria and its Commonwealth partners have an important responsibility to fight against impunity for those responsible for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. The Commonwealth has been strong in its support for the new International Criminal Court. The Commonwealth has also lent support to international efforts to ensure justice for past crimes in Sierra Leone, for instance by nominating judges to serve on the Special Court for Sierra Leone. In his report to your meeting, the Commonwealth Secretary-General stresses the importance of """"international efforts to end impunity and to bring to justice those responsible for heinous crimes.""""   It is unacceptable, therefore, that Nigeria should continue to shield from prosecution Liberian ex-president Charles Taylor who has been charged by the Special Court for Sierra Leone with crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law for his role in Sierra Leone's civil war. It is unprecedented that one member of the Commonwealth should host someone indicted for war crimes in another Commonwealth country. Nigeria played a helpful role in support of Liberia's political transition, and arranging Taylor's safe passage from the country was a contribution to that process. But Nigeria now has an obligation to help bring Taylor to justice.   Over the past decade, decisions by the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and statements by United Nations bodies have consolidated the strong trend against impunity for perpetrators of serious international crimes. As a state party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Nigeria has undertaken legal obligations to cooperate with efforts to bring those who commit serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law to justice. As a result, Nigeria is well placed to react positively to the UN Security Council request of May 2003 that states cooperate with the Sierra Leone Special Court.   Taylor's presence in Nigeria is an affront to his victims in Sierra Leone and an ongoing source of insecurity in the region. It should also be an embarrassment to Commonwealth leaders gathering in Abuja at this time. We urge your government to press the Nigerian authorities to resolve this issue ahead of the Abuja meeting by transferring Taylor immediately to the Special Court for Sierra Leone.   Human Rights Watch also wishes to highlight several other issues of critical concern for sustainable development on which the Commonwealth can play an important role.   Small arms   The widespread availability and misuse of small arms gravely undermines key Commonwealth priorities, including human rights, democracy, people-centered development, and conflict prevention and resolution in many Commonwealth countries. At the 1999 CHOGM in Durban, Commonwealth leaders expressed concern about the uncontrolled flows of such weapons, as well as their excessive and destabilizing accumulation. Since then the issue has been taken up at a United Nations conference in 2001 and in a biennial review in 2003. Much focus has been on illicit trafficking in small arms, leaving aside their irresponsible transfer and misuse by governments. It is thus no surprise that to date little real progress has been made to alleviate the human impacts of the scourge of small arms.   Commonwealth countries, given their commitment to promote human rights, are in a position to help focus the debate on what governments can do to halt and prevent the misuse of small arms. In particular, the Abuja meeting offers an opportunity for Commonwealth leaders to promote the principle that no government should misuse small arms nor authorize arms transfers to human rights abusers. They should pledge to fulfill existing government responsibilities to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law, including by ensuring that police and armed forces strictly uphold international standards on the use of force and firearms.   Commonwealth leaders should also end arms flows to human rights abusers, both internationally and within their own borders. With respect to international transfers, Commonwealth countries should comply fully with the provisions of all applicable instruments defining minimum export criteria, such as the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, as well as the measures of restraint agreed upon in other fora, such as the Economic Community of West African States' moratorium on the import, export, and manufacture of small arms. Commonwealth member governments and the Commonwealth itself should adopt - and make binding - strict arms trade criteria on the observance of human rights and compliance with international humanitarian law. They should also pledge support for a binding international instrument on arms transfers that contains strong human rights and humanitarian criteria, such as the proposed international Arms Trade Treaty. These steps would give further concrete meaning to the 1991 Harare Declaration, in which Commonwealth countries pledged to """"support United Nations and other international institutions in the world's search for peace, disarmament and effective arms control.""""   Gender issues and HIV/AIDS   In keeping with the Commonwealth's strong commitment to women's human rights and women's empowerment within development processes, we urge you to encourage Commonwealth member states to prioritize women's equality within their HIV/AIDS programming.   The deadly link between women's rights abuses and the spread of HIV/AIDS is slowly gaining recognition, but not before millions of women's lives were claimed by the disease. Every day, in every corner of the world, women and girls are beaten in their homes, trafficked into forced prostitution, raped by soldiers and rebels in armed conflicts, sexually abused by their """"caretakers,"""" deprived equal rights to property and other economic assets, assaulted for defying gender norms, and often left with no option but to trade sex for survival. Evidence indicates that women especially at risk are those in a heterosexual marriage or long-term union in a society where men commonly engage in sex outside the union and women confront abuse if they demand condom use. Some women are """"inherited"""" by male in-laws when they become widows, often becoming wives in polygamous families. These acts of discrimination and violence are conduits for HIV infection. Relative to the scale and severity of these abuses, laws, policies, and programs to combat HIV/AIDS by protecting women's rights are negligible.   The relationship between abuses of women's rights and their vulnerability to AIDS is acutely clear in Africa, where 58 percent of those infected with HIV are women. Infection rates among adolescent girls and young women in much of Africa are strikingly higher than those of their male counterparts, exposing the disturbing reality that young women face appalling levels of abuse and discrimination.   Human Rights Watch has recently documented a range of women's rights abuses and how they play a role in women's risk of contracting HIV/AIDS in Africa. For example, in Uganda, we documented how domestic violence prevents women from freely accessing HIV/AIDS information, from negotiating condom use, and from resisting unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, yet the government has failed to take any meaningful steps to prevent and punish such abuse. In Kenya, simply because of their gender, many women AIDS victims sink into poverty and will die even sooner because customs condone evicting women from their homes and taking their property upon their husband's death. In Zambia, orphan girls are often sexually abused at the hands of their guardians, including family members and teachers. In South Africa, the government is lagging in its commitment to provide post-exposure prophylaxis to rape survivors, and girls are deterred from attending school because of high rates of sexual violence and harassment. These issues and more are highlighted in an upcoming Human Rights Watch report entitled """"Policy Paralysis: A Call for Action on HIV/AIDS-Related Human Rights Abuses against Women and Girls in Africa,"""" which will be released in December 2003.   We hope you will urge all Commonwealth member states, and particularly those in Africa, to combat the pervasive discrimination and violence against women and girls that exacerbate the threat of HIV/AIDS.   Business and Human Rights   The Commonwealth Business Council (CBC) has been involved in initiatives to improve corporate governance, reduce corruption, and promote responsible foreign direct investment in developing countries. The CBC has supported the British government's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Human Rights Watch believes that the Commonwealth, through the CBC and otherwise, should help strengthen the EITI and similar transparency initiatives by 1) supporting the idea of compulsory reporting of their payments to governments by companies working in the extractive sector and by 2) providing technical assistance to both companies and governments on how to ensure that this information is meaningful. A useful precedent has already been set by the Nigerian government when they agreed to publish their revenues and authorize companies to publish payments in November.   Human Rights Watch wishes you a very successful meeting and looks forward to continued dialogue on these important issues.

To succeed, he explained, Washington must also embrace a positive vision of """"freedom,"""" """"liberty,"""" and """"democracy,"""" especially in the Middle East. Yet this important message will fall flat if Mr. Bush does not move beyond stirring rhetoric and begin to live by these principles. The truth is, American military might, imposing as it is, will never be enough to defeat terrorism. There are simply too many places for terrorists to operate below the radar screen. Terrorism will succumb only where peaceful political change is a realistic option, and people embrace the international human rights and humanitarian law that explain why terrorism is wrong. Creating such societies is the goal of activists throughout the Middle East. Women's rights activists in Morocco recently sparked changes in the family-status law; Iranian parliamentarians are exposing judicial abuses; Saudi demonstrators are defending political prisoners and protesting government corruption. Their work needs international support. Significantly, Mr. Bush acknowledged the counterproductive nature of past U.S. support for repressive Middle East regimes. But until future U.S. conduct is transformed, many people will continue to see Mr. Bush's promotion of democracy as hypocritical. Mr. Bush broke new ground in identifying Egypt and Saudi Arabia by name as governments that must democratize, although his language was more hortatory than critical. And he reiterated familiar criticism of such long-time nemeses as Syria and Iran. But on Israel's treatment of Palestinians, the human-rights abuse about which Middle Easterners are most passionate, he was silent. He appropriately said that Palestinian leaders must reform, but said nothing about such attributes of Israel's occupation as assassinations and collective punishment. No American human-rights policy will be credible in Middle Eastern eyes without ending the Israel exception. Mr. Bush also spoke tepidly about the rest of the Islamic world. He praised """"democratic progress"""" in Indonesia but ignored Indonesian atrocities in Aceh -- currently the subject of a lawsuit in U.S. courts that the Bush administration is trying to dismiss. He made no mention of Pervez Musharraf's military rule in Pakistan or Islam Karimov's brutal dictatorship in Uzbekistan -- close U.S. allies in the war against terrorism. Nor did Mr. Bush offer any commitment to respect human rights in Washington's own conduct -- the legal black hole of Guantanamo, the denial of due process rights to """"enemy combatants,"""" proposed military commissions with no meaningful right of appeal, the use of """"stress and duress"""" interrogation techniques, the misuse of immigration law, the rendering of suspects to countries such as Syria that practice torture, and the placement of suspects in secret detention facilities with no right to due process. These are the tools of a police state, not the methods of a champion of democracy. When Mr. Reagan made his parliamentary speech, his commitment to democracy also seemed hypocritical, coming at a time of U.S. support for highly abusive forces in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Angola, Liberia, Somalia, and Zaire. But recognizing the need to walk the walk, not just talk the talk, Mr. Reagan began to offer actual U.S. support for local efforts to topple the dictatorships of Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Jean-Claude Duvalier in Haiti, and Augusto Pinochet in Chile -- all, previously, U.S. allies. Mr. Bush, too, should take this opportunity to bring U.S. behaviour into line with U.S. preaching. Only a genuine commitment to fighting terrorism in strict compliance with democracy, human rights, and the rule of law will make Mr. Bush's articulated vision credible and attractive in the places where it is needed most.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/25/colombia-paramilitary-television-broadcast-travesty","Colombia- Paramilitary Television Broadcast a Travesty","Colombia: Paramilitary Television Broadcast a “Travesty” ","","11/25/2003","(New York) - The Colombian government's television broadcast of a paramilitary demobilization risks becoming a showcase for impunity, Human Rights Watch said today. In a live telecast featuring government officials and paramilitary fighters, the government will broadcast videotaped statements from paramilitary leaders who have been convicted of massacres, murders and other serious crimes, but remain at large. The telecast is scheduled to take place during the demobilization of an estimated 800 paramilitary fighters of the Bloque Cacique Nutibara, part of the alliance known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). Since 2002, paramilitaries have been in talks with the government about turning in their weapons. Paramilitary leaders have refused to surrender, however, and have demanded international immunity for their crimes    """"The broadcast is a travesty,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of handing these criminals a microphone, the government should be concentrating on arresting them and bringing them to justice."""" Human Rights Watch questioned the strategy of allowing low-level paramilitaries to demobilize while leaving their leaders free to recruit new members and continue to operate and commit further crimes. As yet, no clear rules have been established to ensure that individuals who have committed serious human rights abuses will be prosecuted or even investigated. Among the paramilitary leaders scheduled to speak via video to a live television audience is Carlos Castaño, the head of the AUC. A survey of the crimes that Castaño has been convicted of or has admitted to makes horrifying reading. In 2001, a Colombian judge sentenced Castaño to 22 years in prison for his role in the assassination of Patriotic Union presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa, shot in 1990 in Bogotá's El Dorado airport. Since its founding in 1984, the Patriotic Union has been virtually exterminated in attacks on party members by paramilitaries under Castaño's command, often working in coordination with Colombia's military. In his authorized biography, Mi Confesión, Castaño gave a detailed account of how he selected and trained the juvenile assassin who in 1990 murdered a second presidential candidate, M-19 leader Carlos Pizarro; this was the same boy who authorities say he used to kill Jaramillo. As a result, the Attorney General's office recommended in June 2002 that Castaño be convicted of the murder and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Castaño has also acknowledged that he planned the 1994 assassination of Colombian Senator Manuel Cepeda, carried out in coordination with Colombian army officers. In April 2003, a judge in Antioquia sentenced Castaño to 40 years in prison for arranging the 1997 El Aro massacre of at least 15 people. Witnesses said that paramilitaries took one resident to a house, tied him to a tree, and then gouged out his eyes and cut off his tongue and testicles before killing him. Also this year, a Bogotá court sentenced Castaño to 40 years in prison for his role in organizing the 1997 Mapiripán massacre. At dawn on July 15, an estimated 200 heavily armed paramilitaries members began rounding up residents in this jungle town. Over a five-day period, paramilitaries are believed to have killed over 30 people, torturing them before throwing their bodies into a nearby river. As of January, Colombia's attorney general had opened at least 35 additional criminal cases against Castaño. In 27 of the cases, formal arrest warrants have been issued against him. """"There is no question that individuals like Carlos Castaño-who have planned, ordered, paid for, and even taken part in atrocities-belong in jail, not on a government-sponsored television broadcast,"""" Vivanco noted. Another paramilitary leader scheduled to take part in the event is Diego Murillo Bejarano, known as """"Don Berna"""" or """"Adolfo Paz."""" Currently, Murillo leads the Bloque Cacique Nutibara. Murillo is a former security chief for the Galeano crime family, in the 1980s associates of drug trafficker Pablo Escobar and other members of the Medellín cartel. Murillo has also been linked by the authorities to Medellín gangs used to carry out high profile assassinations. Earlier this year, advisers to President Álvaro Uribe Vélez identified Murillo as a major drugs trafficker. Also scheduled to speak is Salvatore Mancuso, another paramilitary chieftain. In April, a judge in Antioquia sentenced Mancuso to 40 years in prison for arranging the 1997 El Aro massacre. That same year, the Attorney General's office issued an arrest warrant for Mancuso in relation to his involvement in the 1996 murders of two brothers and another man in the department of Sucre. According to the investigation, 10 paramilitaries under Mancuso's command selected the three men from a list of names, then executed them on the spot. In total, the Attorney General's office has issued eight arrest warrants for Mancuso related to massacres and selective killings.","Americas, Colombia",""

Foreign oil companies operating in Sudan have been complicit in this displacement, and the death and destruction that have accompanied it. The report, """"Sudan, Oil, and Human Rights,"""" investigates the role that oil has played in Sudan's civil war. This 754-page report is the most comprehensive examination yet published of the links between natural-resource exploitation and human rights abuses.  """"Oil development in southern Sudan should have been a cause of rejoicing for Sudan's people,"""" said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"Instead, it has brought them nothing but woe.""""  The report documents how the government has used the roads, bridges and airfields built by the oil companies as a means for it to launch attacks on civilians in the southern oil region of Western Upper Nile (also known as Unity state). In addition to its regular army, the government has deployed militant Islamist militias to prosecute the war, and has armed southern factions in a policy of ethnic manipulation and destabilization.  Human Rights Watch urged that the current peace negotiations deal comprehensively with the legacy of Sudan's oil war, particularly the ethnic divisions that persist in oilfields of the south and threaten the long-term peace.  The report provides evidence of the complicity of oil companies in the human rights abuses. Oil company executives turned a blind eye to well-reported government attacks on civilian targets, including aerial bombing of hospitals, churches, relief operations and schools.  """"Oil companies operating in Sudan were aware of the killing, bombing, and looting that took place in the south, all in the name of opening up the oilfields,"""" said Rone. """"These facts were repeatedly brought to their attention in public and private meetings, but they continued to operate and make a profit as the devastation went on.""""  Conditions for civilians in the oilfields actually worsened when the Canadian company Talisman Energy Inc. and the Swedish company Lundin Oil AB were lead partners in two concessions in southern Sudan. Amid mounting pressure from rights groups, Talisman sold its interest in its Sudanese concessions in late 2002, and Lundin followed in June.  These Western-based corporations were replaced by the state-owned oil companies of China and Malaysia- CNPC, or China National Petroleum Corp., and Petronas, or Petrolium Nasional Berhad-which had already been partners with Talisman and Lundin. Following CNPC and Petronas, a third state-owned Asian oil company, India's ONGC Videsh Ltd., began operations in Sudan.  Statistics from the Sudanese government and the oil companies show how the major share (60 percent) of the US$580 million received in oil revenue by this poverty-stricken country in 2001 was absorbed by its military, both for foreign weapons purchases and for the development of a domestic arms industry.  """"The Sudanese government has used the oil money in conducting scorched-earth campaigns to drive hundreds of thousands of farmers and pastoralists from their homes atop the oil fields,"""" said Rone. """"These civilians have not been compensated nor relocated peacefully-far from it. Instead, government forces have looted their cattle and grain, and destroyed their homes and villages, killed and injured their relatives, and even prevented emergency relief agencies from bringing any assistance to them.""""  The 20-year civil war in Sudan has been fought between the Islamist, northern-based Arab-speaking government and the vast marginalized African populations of southern Sudan, where the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) has been the largest rebel group. The war spread to eastern and central Sudan, and while the parties signed a cease-fire agreement in October 2002 western Sudan remains engulfed in war.  The report also covers the SPLM/A's role in the struggle over oilfields. The regular SPLM/A forces have carried out serious human rights abuses, including summary execution of captured combatants. Commanding officers of the SPLM/A have taken no steps to investigate or punish these crimes.  Peace talks promoted by a troika of the United States, Britain and Norway have been underway in Kenya since June 2002. However, the Sudanese government and the SPLM/A, the only parties to the talks, have yet to agree on how to share revenue from the oil reserves, most of which lie in the south. The northern-based government has agreed to a self-determination referendum for the south, but not until 6 1/2 years after the peace agreement is signed.  """"The hundreds of thousands of persons displaced from the oilfields should be allowed to return, with guarantees of safety and compensation for their losses,"""" Rone said. """"This needs to be a central part of the peace agreement.""""","Africa, Sudan","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/24/uzbekistan-no-progress-ebrd-benchmarks","Uzbekistan- No Progress on EBRD Benchmarks","Uzbekistan: No Progress on EBRD Benchmarks","","11/24/2003","Uzbekistan has made no real progress toward meeting the human rights benchmarks set by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in its current country strategy for Uzbekistan, Human Rights Watch said today. In a new fact sheet, Human Rights Watch documents the Uzbek government’s increased persecution of political opposition figures and civil society activists, and the continued violent crackdown against independent Muslims in the months following the bank’s previous visit in July. Despite the release of four human rights defenders from prison, authorities have jailed Ruslan Sharipov, an independent journalist and human rights defender, on what appear to be politically motivated charges, and brought questionable criminal charges against another two defenders. Authorities have also failed to prosecute those responsible for the abduction and severe beating of Sharipov’s legal representative, Surat Ikramov, in late August. The Uzbek government has not allowed any independent local human rights group to register since the EBRD adopted its country strategy in March. The government says it has changed its legal definition of torture to bring it in line with the Convention against Torture, but otherwise has taken no real steps to curb it. A draft action plan, drawn up by the authorities to implement the recommendations of the United Nations special rapporteur on torture, has been widely criticized for emphasizing seminars and conferences while proposing little concrete action. “More than halfway through the one-year deadline set by the EBRD there is virtually no change on the ground,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “This should certainly set off warning signals within the bank and its shareholder governments. They should now redouble efforts to ensure that their engagement with Uzbekistan serves to promote human rights and democracy in the country.” The EBRD country strategy for Uzbekistan found that the country’s progress toward democracy and human rights remained “slow and characterized by setbacks,” and set three human rights benchmarks for the government to fulfill: greater political openness and freedom of the media; registration and free functioning of independent civil society groups; and implementation of the recommendations of the U.N. special rapporteur on torture following his country visit to Uzbekistan late last year. The bank gave the government a one-year deadline for compliance with these benchmarks. The bank’s country strategy was adopted at a critical moment for the institution’s engagement with Uzbekistan, less than two months before the EBRD in May held its annual meeting in Tashkent. The bank’s decision to allow the Uzbek government, among the most repressive in the region, to host its annual meeting stirred significant controversy. In 2002 Human Rights Watch began a campaign calling on the EBRD to use its leverage prior to the meeting to press for concrete progress in human rights. The bank instead argued that it was confident the meeting itself would serve as an incentive for reform. The annual meeting was marred by numerous incidents of government harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders who had used the event to speak out against abuse. The bank nonetheless trumpeted the meeting as a success and afterwards has not publicly reaffirmed its demand that the Uzbek government institute reforms. “It should be clear to everyone by now that quiet diplomacy simply doesn’t work in a country like Uzbekistan,” said Denber. “The EBRD would do better speaking out about the alarming lack of progress in human rights, and publicly calling on the Uzbek government to move forward with the necessary reforms.” Human Rights Watch also called on concerned governments and other intergovernmental institutions to help advance the benchmarks set by the EBRD. “Shareholder governments must make these calls an integral part of their bilateral dialogues with the Uzbek government, and use every opportunity to push for reforms,” said Denber. “Institutions such as the OSCE, the U.N. and the EU should make full use of the mechanisms available to them to drive home the message about needed reforms in Uzbekistan.” Among those best positioned to affect change in Uzbekistan are the United States and the European Union, both of which have important levers available to them in the coming months.

Massachusetts’s legislators should abide by the state Supreme Judicial Court’s ruling and amend the state’s marriage-licensing law to ensure equal access to civil marriage. “The Massachusetts court has clearly said that same-sex partners should have the same right to marry as heterosexual couples,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Any couple should be free to demonstrate their love and commitment to each other through marriage. The state should not discriminate in this deeply personal area because of the partners’ gender or sexual orientation.” On November 18, the state’s highest court ordered in Goodridge et. al. v Department of Public Health that gay and lesbian couples be admitted to the full rights of civil marriage. The court gave the state legislature six months to amend laws to conform with the decision. Since then, several prominent state officials—including Governor Mitt Romney, Attorney General Thomas Reilly, and Speaker of the House of Representatives Thomas Finneran—have suggested that the legislature create special “civil unions” for gay and lesbian couples. These “civil unions” would provide some of the rights of marriage, but would create a separate but unequal system that would fail to meet the court’s stipulation. “History shows again and again that separate is never equal,” said Roth. “Civil unions rarely if ever offer the full roster of rights that marriage entails. And they stigmatize same-sex relationships by suggesting they deserve only second-class recognition.” In a September 4 briefing paper (https://www.hrw.org/backgrounder/lgbt/civil-marriage.htm) on equality in civil marriage, Human Rights Watch noted that civil unions have represented progress—but insufficient progress. Civil unions do not carry the same promises of recognition across international borders that marriage ordinarily implies. The burden is on governments to justify the denial of recognition to foreign marriages, but the burden usually—and unfairly—rests on partners in civil unions to justify their recognition abroad. In Massachusetts, the Goodridge decision listed, “with no attempt to be comprehensive,” 21 different laws conferring 16 different benefits on married couples in relation to property rights alone. “There is no guarantee that civil unions will offer equality in all the benefits of marriage,” Roth said. “The simplest and fairest solution is to open the status of civil marriage to same-sex couples, and end all these inequalities with one stroke of a pen.” Governor Romney and other state officials have also called for an amendment to the Massachusetts state constitution to define marriage as the union of a man and a woman. Other politicians have advocated a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution. “Constitutions should protect people from prejudice, not enshrine inequality,” said Roth. The Goodridge decision took pains to distinguish civil marriage, which it called a “wholly secular institution,” from the marriage practices or beliefs of religious groups. In its briefing paper, Human Rights Watch observed that civil laws on marriage can be changed to end discrimination based on sexual orientation without violating the prerogatives of religions to their own rules and practices. However, so long as the state retains marriage as a marker of legal recognition of relationships, it should be governed by international protections for equality and against discrimination. Equality under law and protection against discrimination are basic principles of international human rights, as well as of civil rights in the United States. Numerous international bodies have affirmed that sexual orientation is a protected status. The United Nations Human Rights Committee held in 1994 that the prohibition of discrimination in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) should be understood to include sexual orientation. The United States ratified the ICCPR in 1992.

The organisations, Amnesty International, the Association for the Prevention of Torture (APT), Human Rights Watch (HRW), the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), the International Service for Human Rights (ISHR), and the World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) also have called on the Government of Nepal to extend invitations to visit the country to the human rights experts of the United Nations Human Rights Commission. On 18 November, the NHRC issued a call for United Nations human rights experts, including those charged with examining arbitrary detention and torture, to visit the country. The NHCR has presented a proposal for a Human Rights Accord to the Government and the Maoist rebels which would provide for five NHRC regional monitoring units in the country to operate in cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In a joint statement of 18 November, the Canadian Embassy, the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the French Embassy, the German Society for Technical Cooperation (GTZ), the Royal Danish Embassy, the Royal Norwegian Embassy, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Netherlands Development Organisation have expressed concern about """"the rapidly deteriorating human rights situation"""" and declared that there is an """"urgent need"""" for the Government and the Maoist rebels to sign the proposed Human Rights Accord. The Nepal Bar Association and many Nepalese human rights organisations have made similar calls for an international monitoring presence. Background Since the breakdown of peace talks in August, the incidents of extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detentions in Nepal have risen dramatically. A large number of persons have been held incommunicado in army barracks. Officers at army barracks have been refusing to accept habeas corpus notices issued by the Nepal Supreme Court, on behalf of detainees. The Government of Nepal has recently sought to undermine the independent NHRC by proposing the establishment of a parallel human rights unit directly under the supervision of the Prime Minister. Army officials have challenged the NHRC over the findings by its independent experts that at least 19 unarmed persons were extra-judicially executed by army personnel in Ramechhap District on 17 August 2003.","Asia, Nepal",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/24/sudan-rebels-religion-and-oil","Sudan- Rebels Religion and Oil","Sudan: Rebels, Religion and Oil","","11/24/2003","Whatever it did for the balance of payments, oil did not bring peace. Sudan, Africa 's largest country by geography and one of its poorest, has been battered by civil war for thirty seven of the forty seven years since the British left. The government - military or elected, Islamist or secular - has always belonged to a minority population , the educated Arab-speaking Muslim elite from the northern Nile Valley. Sudan's thirty five million population - sixty to seventy percent African and thirty to forty percent non-Muslim - was economically, socially, and politically marginalised. Ever since Chevron discovered substantial southern oil reserves in 1978, the impoverished African south feared the oil refinery, pipeline, port, and other infrastructure would be located in the north, and it would be cheated of its potential benefits. That is exactly what has come to pass. Now peace talks are under way in Kenya, strongly encouraged and pushed by the United States, Britain and Norway - the Troika. Oil battles It seemed for a while that oil would prolong the conflict. Indeed, in 1999, oil in the ground became the main objective of government military actions - scorched earth campaigns intended to run southern pastoralists off their land. Oil above ground became a target of sporadic rebel attacks designed to scare off foreign oil operators , as was done in 1984 with Chevron. The military did its best to create a cordon sanitaire. Hundreds of thousands of southern Sudanese whose families had unsuspectingly lived with their cattle on the oilfields for centuries have been brutally displaced, without notice, hearing or compensation. Finally production began - on the military's terms. Conveniently, the new oil revenues , soaring from $547 million in 2000 to $805 million last year, enabled the Sudanese military to purchase attack helicopters and weapons that intensified the war and expanded oil 'protection'. Up to sixty percent of the revenues went to military spending - which increased by almost fifty percent in two years. Sudan bought sixteen attack helicopters from Russia between 2001 and 2002, more than tripling its fleet. They were often used against civilian populations. In February last year, in plain view of international food monitors, helicopters targeted a relief distribution site in the oilfields, killing seventeen civilians and wounding many more. Seven died later of their wounds. The government claimed that the attack was a mistake, but defended its right to secure oilfield safety. This provoked its most controversial foreign investor, Talisman Energy of Canada, privately to rebuke Khartoum for linking oilfield safety and civilian deaths. Within a year, however, Talisman pulled out, giving in to an international human rights campaign. Abuses Human rights groups condemned Talisman and the other foreign oil investors for their role in oil development in Sudan, whose record of gross human rights abuses that intensified when the Islamist government came to power through a military coup in 1989. By 1998, when Talisman stepped in, two million Sudanese - mostly southerners - were already dead and four million displaced because of the war, not to mention war-provoked famines and epidemics. The human rights groups claimed that foreign companies operating in the southern theatre of war exacerbated the abuses; the companies built new oilfield airstrips, bridges, and roads which were promptly put to military use. Successful operations by Talisman and its partners - Petronas Nasional Berhad of Malaysia (Petronas) and the China National Petroleum Company (CNPC) - produced a revenue stream that enticed the government to clear more civilians from their pastures and small sorghum fields . The pipeline attracted further companies to this new frontier, making remote fields economically viable. As a result of the human rights drumming, Talisman sold out - not to a western oil company, but to yet another Asian state-owned oil firm, ONGC Videsh Ltd of India. Two European companies owning concessions to the south of Talisman's followed suit this year. Lundin of Sweden and OMV of Austria - a large privatising state oil firm - sold to Petronas and ONGC Videsh respectively. Ideally, for reasons of sovereignty and national security, the nation's main natural resource should not rest so firmly in the control of three Asian state oil companies, with their own foreign policy agendas and domestic needs. But the persistent human rights campaign was an effective deterrent to other western companies considering investment. Pariah no more This squeeze on the fledgling oil industry coincided with serious peace talks. The government, under stringent unilateral sanctions imposed by US presidential executive order in 1997, badly wanted to improve its relationship with Washington. It sought to be promoted from the pariah status to which the US had consigned it in 1993, putting it on its list of countries supporting terrorism. Sudan's opportunity came on September 11 2001. It promptly offered counter-terrorism cooperation with Washington, including over-flight permission, something not immediately provided by many European allies. US State Department personnel had already been allowed in to investigate whether the terrorist training camps it harboured when Osama Bin Laden was living in Sudan from 1990 to 1996 were still in place. Although it was widely denounced, the August 1998 American cruise missile bombing of a pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum softened up the Islamist government for this cooperation. But there was a powerful new lobby in the US: the conservative religious movement took Sudan as its first foreign policy target. It railed against religious persecution of Christians and slavery. With the election of its favourite son, President George Bush, it gained a powerful ally. Bush promptly appointed a special envoy for peace in Sudan, former senator and clergyman John Danforth. Within a year, Danforth had succeeded in moving much closer to peace than anyone thought possible. The main parties to the war, the Sudanese government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), went on to agree in July last year to a referendum for southerners on self-determination. They also agreed that sharia - Islamic law - would govern the north but not the south. For the next year and a half, they slogged through many other issues, but so far have not agreed on sharing power and oil revenue. Ethnic divide But the government's key weapon, which gave it a toehold in the oil concession operated by Talisman on the north-south border, threatens to blow back in the face of peace. This weapon was not military but political: an ethnic divide and conquer policy in the south. The government supported a faction of the SPLM/A that split from the rebel group in 1991 along ethnic lines - part of the Nuer ethnic group traditionally residing in the oilfields. The Nuer, the second-largest southern ethnic group, took on the largest , the Dinka, which dominates the officer corps of the SPLM/A. The Nuer temporarily pushed the SPLM/A out of the oil business. In this interlude, Talisman , Lundin, OMV, Petronas, CNPC and others decided to invest. The government's success in playing the ethnic card began to break down, however. It weakened the Nuer faction by causing a proliferation of 'warlords'. Then the Sudanese military insisted on 'guarding' all the oilfields, even in home areas of ex-rebel leaders, not allowing a role for the Nuer. Finally, ordinary southerners did not even receive the crumbs of the oil business: the government allowed CNPC to bring in ten thousand Chinese labourers to build the infrastructure. The faction leaders may have been fool enough to believe the government's promises, but they were not fool enough to miss the fact that none of them were kept. The main Nuer faction first went on the military offensive to prevent Sudanese government troop incursions into 'their' oilfields in 1999. Lundin and OMV had to suspend operations several times, for months at a time. They did not succeed in stopping Talisman, however. After almost three years of resistance, the main Nuer faction returned to the SPLM/A. Numerous militias remain behind, out of fear and loathing for the SPLM/A commander in chief, Colonel John Garang. They have political differences as well. Paradoxically, the militias are avowed separatists and Garang is a strong proponent of a united Sudan. One country or two? In peace talks, the Troika and the international community have supported unity. The Sudanese government prefers unity, if only because the oil lies mainly in the south. Thus the agreed referendum on southern self-determination has a long waiting period - six and a half years after signature, an aeon in politics. The internationally accepted myth is that this will give the northerners time to convince the southerners, through internationally funded development projects, that they would benefit from staying with a transformed united country and would no longer be second-class citizens. But can a tiger change his stripes? And will his victims suddenly want to live with him? Southern popular opinion is solidly pro-independence. The war, fought mostly in the south, has left enormous death and destruction. It also led to the resurgence of slave-taking, returning to the first relationship the north had with the south in the nineteenth century. The Troika has invested heavily in time and money in helping - or strong-arming - the parties towards an agreement. If successful, it would be a very bright spot in Bush's Africa and foreign policy. Pact between dictators One of the main controversies is that only the main two fighting forces are party to the talks; neither was chosen in free and fair elections. Northern political parties, which repeatedly won elections in democratic times, and southern militia leaders threaten that as long as they are excluded, the agreement will be no more than a pact between 'two dictators' - which they are not obliged to recognise. The Troika understood the downside of limiting talks to the two parties. But if the war was to be ended, then the principal contestants had to agree, by no means an easy task. The Troika also feared an 'open sesame' effect. Sudan is enormously diverse. Its hundreds of ethnic groups and religions cannot sit comfortably at the table, and would multiply the difficulties. Rights and Diversity Also controversial is the absence of any provision for human rights accountability. The Troika has not made serious accountability or truth proposals, and the parties - which have terrible human rights records - do not want to end up in jail. But this would be a big step backward from other recent African agreements providing some form of justice at war's end, or at the very least, disclosure. Indeed, one of the chief causes of the war's persistence and spread beyond the south - to central Sudan in the 1980s, the east in the 1990s, and the west this year - is that the ruling Islamist - military party does not respect diversity among Muslims and Arabs, much less the country's African majority. There are gross abuses of the rights of the majority. If the government could abandon its central programme of Islamising and Arabising the people and agree to real multi-party democracy and human rights, peace might have a chance. That is a big if. The government recently blew its chance to show it has changed. It failed to come to peaceful agreement with the marginalised people in the western region of Darfur and is seeking a military solution to land problems instead. Not only the government must change its stripes: the biggest challenge faced by the military - dominated SPLM/A is to convert itself into a governing political party, and allow power sharing and multiparty democracy in the south. There are hints, however, that the rebels are preparing a single-party government for the southern region, with no coalitions and no reconciliation with southern enemies, particularly the militias. The Troika has secured the commitment of the government and SPLM/A to share positions with those not already within their ranks. After all, this is a war that no one has won militarily. While the government is astonishingly making noises about democracy, transparency and accountability, Garang has not even paid lip service to political pluralism, aside from assurances that he is 'reaching out' to other southerners. The SPLM/A shunned a church-organised south-south reconciliation meeting in late May and ignored civil society groups as well as the militias. Militias While the Troika has kept to the successful negotiating strategy of not breaking rank on any issue, cracks have begun to appear over the approach to southern militias. The US considers south-south politics almost byzantine. Britain, which is more capable of such analysis because of its history in Sudan, has taken a hands-off position, saying that the two parties will have to resolve these issues. But history suggests that the parties are not eager to share the spoils, particularly if they are sweetened by the greater oil production that peace offers. The SPLM/A runs a major risk: if it does not even attempt to reconcile with the ex-rebel militia leaders entrenched in their home areas, these proud commanders will not disarm. A cut-off in government support will not immediately finish them, as Sudan is awash in weaponry - and intrigue. Hardliners in Khartoum still reject the notion of giving their long-time enemy, Garang, the post of vice-president. The militias now insist on being called 'armed groups' rather than the derogatory term 'militias', which suggests that they are ready to make a deal, but not on their knees. The time is ripe for bold new measures, in the spirit of peacemaking and wrapping up the entire war in the south. Until then, the militias remain a potential tool in the hands of the Islamist government awaiting its chance to undermine the peace agreement and press on with the Islamisation and Arabisation crusade. Unreconciled southern militias offer a sure-fire means of stirring up southerners to fight each other again, and thus prevent a self-determination referendum. Making sure this peace agreement is not simply another marker in a continuing war remains a major challenge.  _____Jemera Rone is Counsel/Sudan Researcher at Human Rights Watch, Africa Division.

Increasingly, armed opponents of the U.S.-led occupation of Iraq are targeting Iraqi civilians whom they perceive as cooperating with the CPA. On November 20, the body of Sargoun Nanou Murado, a member of the municipal council of Basra, was found after he was reportedly abducted on November 18. On November 19, the education ministry's provincial director general was killed in the southern town of al-Diwaniyya.  International humanitarian law, or the laws of war, absolutely prohibits the targeting of civilians. Civilians working for the occupying power are not legitimate targets of attack.  """"All Iraqi civilians are protected by the Geneva Conventions,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division. """"It doesn't matter whether they sympathize with the U.S. occupation, or with the insurgents.""""  Sargoun Murado represented Basra's small community of Assyrian Christians on the municipal council. In the immediate aftermath of the war, Basra's Shi`a Muslim religious leadership repeatedly stated its commitment to protecting the rights of the small but economically influential community.  These attacks targeting civilians continue a pattern of bombings and assassinations. Insurgents have warned that they will target anyone who works with the occupation authorities. In one of the more high profile assassinations, Aqila al-Hashimi, one of the three female members of the Iraq Governing Council, was shot by gunmen near her home in Baghdad on September 20, 2003, and died from her injuries five days later.  According to press reports, two prominent judges as well as two politicians connected with the occupation or with its Iraqi counterpart, the provisional council, were killed in early November. Judge Muhan Jabir al-Shuwaili, who was leading an investigation into abuses by Saddam's regime, was kidnapped in al-Najaf along with a prosecutor, and later murdered by assailants who told him just before he died, """"Saddam has ordered your execution."""" The prosecutor was allowed to live to tell the tale.  In Mosul, Ismail Yusif, a provincial judge who was a deputy to the head of the provincial appeals courts was killed on November 1. In Baghdad, deputy mayor Faris `Abd al-Razzaq al-A`sam was also killed this month, as was a prominent member of a Baghdad neighborhood committee set up by the U.S. authorities.

In 1993, when the fate of a free trade accord in North America hung in the balance, Mexico, Canada and the United States attached a side accord to NAFTA, committing themselves to promote basic labor rights in the region. Once the trade regime was in place, however, the labor commitment was largely forgotten. It didn't have to be this way. The labor side accord of NAFTA was the most ambitious effort ever to address labor rights in a trade agreement. It committed the three countries to enforce their laws on freedom of association, nondiscrimination in the workplace, a minimum wage and other workers' basic human rights. It required them to promote high labor standards and provide access to fair labor tribunals. Most importantly, it granted them the authority to hold each other accountable for failing to meet these obligations. Twenty-five complaints have since been filed under the accord, alleging widespread violations of labor law in all three countries. The violations include life-threatening health and safety conditions, denial of collective bargaining rights, firings for workers' organizing efforts, and mistreatment of migrant workers. Several major multinational corporations were named as violators. Under the accord, when a government of one country receives a complaint of violations committed in one of the other two, it can investigate the charges. If it finds that the neighboring government had failed to fulfill certain of the obligations, it can levy fines or impose sanctions. The complaint process is convoluted, and the threat of fines or sanctions tame when compared with the legal remedies that NAFTA grants corporations and investors to enforce their commercial rights. Still, the accord represents a breakthrough in the area of international labor rights: a treaty with teeth. Unfortunately, the governments have chosen not to bite. Not one of the complaints filed under the side accord has resulted in fines or sanctions. At most, the complaints have led to high-level consultations between governments, as well as local-level public meetings aimed at raising awareness about violations and discussing possible solutions. To take one example, a Human Rights Watch investigation in 1997 found that employers in the maquiladora factories of northern Mexico routinely required women to undergo pregnancy tests as a means of screening out job applicants who might require maternity benefits once hired. Together with other groups, Human Rights Watch together filed a complaint accusing the Mexican government of failing to curb this discrimination based on pregnancy. But after U.S. officials reviewed the complaint and confirmed the charges, the only action they took was to reach an agreement with the Mexican government to sponsor public """"outreach sessions"""" on this issue. These sessions did little to end the practice, and Mexican maquiladoras continued to conduct illegal pregnancy testing. The NAFTA side accord could have had a significant impact on labor rights if the governments had chosen to hold each other accountable. But they did not. And there is little reason to think that members of the proposed FTAA would do any better. A lesson of NAFTA is that tariff benefits, once granted, are rarely withdrawn. Instead, countries reap the benefits of trade accords while ignoring their obligations to promote labor rights. What is needed is a mechanism that makes the reduction of tariffs contingent upon countries' labor practices. Tariff reductions should be granted to a country only after an independent panel of experts has determined that it has met its labor rights obligations under the accord. Efforts to assure the protection of labor rights in a future Free Trade Area of the Americas would do well to borrow from the NAFTA recipe by incorporating the obligations that the labor side accord established. But they must be sure to include the missing ingredient needed to make those obligations count: accountability.  ____ **) Daniel Wilkinson is the author of """"Silence on the Mountain: Stories of Terror, Betrayal, and Forgetting in Guatemala"""" (Houghton Mifflin).","Americas, United States, Canada, Mexico","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

But there is another glaring illegality here — which is entirely the responsibility of the US Government. At Guantanamo, hundreds have been held without charge for two years, abandoned in a legal black hole. Before arriving in London, Bush insisted that the proposed military commissions for prosecuting these prisoners held at the US base would be “in line with international accords”. Nothing could be further from the truth. As currently proposed, these tribunals would trample the most basic principles of international law. Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, has had tough talks with Washington, hoping to secure fair trials for two Britons, Feroz Abbasi and Moazzam Begg. He got a guarantee that the pair will not be executed and will be allowed confidential access to their lawyers. Otherwise, the US Government sent him home empty-handed. That bodes poorly for all other Guantanamo detainees, including seven Britons, who could be brought before the commissions. Tony Blair told the Commons last month that we had to realise “there is a reason why these people have been detained”. The depressing fact is that there is no way for us to judge whether that is true. Any charges against the detainees have not been made public, and the stories told by prisoners eventually released from Guantanamo suggest that the flimsiest of reasons for detention sometimes suffice. The military commissions´ rules would not allow defendants to have their cases reviewed by independent civilian courts, even on appeal. This is why the commissions are profoundly unjust. Even US court-martial verdicts can be appealed to a civilian court. But these military commissions would allow appeal only to Bush, the Defence Secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, or their appointees. Bush and Rumsfeld have already proclaimed the guilt of those at Guantanamo, calling them “bad people” and “the worst of the worst”. In short: the US Government, with hardly an open mind, has made itself prosecutor, judge and jury. Under prodding from Lord Goldsmith, Bush would consider appointing civilians to an appeal panel of judges. But these judges could be removed by Bush, and thus still have no independence. As for the trial itself, the rules do not ensure that a suspect can see all evidence against him — leaving him in the extraordinary position of having to defend himself in the dark. The only person allowed to see all the secret evidence would be a lawyer appointed by the Pentagon, but that lawyer cannot discuss that evidence with the suspect. That makes it impossible for the suspect to marshal key facts that might prove his innocence. A suspect can hire his own lawyer, but he also would not have access to the most secret evidence, even after a full security vetting. Trials conducted in these circumstances would be a grotesque parody of justice. Repatriation for Abbasi and Begg would help those two men, not least because they might well be released for lack of evidence that could be used in a British court. It would, however, leave the broader concerns unaddressed. Defeating terrorism means convincing the world of the importance of the rule of law. The Bush Administration severely handicaps this effort if, in the process of fighting terrorism´s violation of the right to life, it so fundamentally violates the right to a fair trial. Blair must use his political capital in Washington to make that point — not discreetly, but loudly enough to be heard, at last, by the rest of the world.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, United Kingdom","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo - Military Commissions"

An Islamist organization linked to al-Qaeda and other armed militant groups abroad claimed responsibility for the attacks on the synagogues, and it seems likely that the same group, or a similar militant organization, was responsible for today’s killings. “These bombings are terrible crimes that display an appalling indifference to civilian life,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Violence of this kind threatens the stability of a country that is finding its way out of conflict and moving toward respect for human rights and the rule of law.” Human Rights Watch called for a thorough investigation of the bombings, and for those found responsible to be prosecuted in a trial with full guarantees of due process in accordance with international standards.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Taylor is charged with crimes against humanity, war crimes and other serious violations of international humanitarian law for his role in contributing to the deaths, rape and mutilations of thousands of civilians during Sierra Leone's civil war. Impunity for Taylor would defy international law, be an affront to Taylor's innumerable victims, and undermine the establishment of a lasting peace in the region based on the rule of law.   We believe Nigeria should resolve this issue urgently ahead of the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting you will host in Abuja from 5-8 December 2003. It is unacceptable for a leading member of the Commonwealth such as Nigeria to provide refuge to someone indicted for war crimes in another Commonwealth country such as Sierra Leone.   Nigeria's Obligations Under International Law   Over the past decade, the ad hoc criminal tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and United Nations (U.N.) bodies have consolidated the strong trend against impunity for perpetrators of serious human rights crimes. The U.N. Security Council has expressly affirmed the need to bring to justice those who violate international humanitarian and human rights law and the U.N. General Assembly has rejected the use of amnesty laws for serious violations of human rights. (S/PRST/1998/18; S/PRST/1999/6; A/RES/44/162; A/RES/47/133)   The heinous crimes committed during Sierra Leone's civil war have prompted U.N. bodies to make significant statements to ensure that perpetrators of these crimes do not escape justice. In 1999, the U.N. Special Representative of the Secretary-General attached a disclaimer to the Lomé Peace Agreement rejecting any interpretation that the amnesty under the accord would extend to genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during Sierra Leone's civil war. In 1999, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights stated in regards to Sierra Leone that, """"in any armed conflict, including an armed conflict not of an international character, the taking of hostages, wilful killing and torture or inhuman treatment of persons taking no active part in the hostilities constitutes a grave breach of international humanitarian law, and that all countries are under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches and bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before their own courts."""" (Resolution 1999/1)   Nigeria is well placed to react positively to the U.N. Security Council request that states cooperate with the Sierra Leone Special Court. (S/RES/1478) Nigeria has freely undertaken legal obligations to cooperate with efforts to bring those who commit serious human rights crimes to justice. For example, as a state party to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, Nigeria has committed to extradite or prosecute those responsible for war crimes that amount to grave breaches of the Conventions. As a state party to the Convention against Torture, Nigeria has committed to extradite or prosecute those responsible for all acts of torture.   The Special Court's statute and implementing legislation affirm that there is no legal basis for shielding Taylor from justice. Article 6(2) of the Special Court's statute provides that the official position of any accused person does not relieve him or her of criminal responsibility. Article 10 of the Statute provides that an amnesty granted to an accused person does not operate as a bar to prosecution by the Special Court. The International Court of Justice has also affirmed that immunity for high-ranking officials does not apply before international criminal courts with jurisdiction.   Nigeria's Commitment to Justice   As a state party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and a member of the Management Committee of the Sierra Leone Special Court, Nigeria has made a strong commitment in principle to end impunity for the most serious human rights crimes and to support the work of the Special Court to bring justice for the horrific abuses committed in Sierra Leone's civil war.   Both in your role as head of the Africa Leadership Forum and following your return to office as civilian head of state in Nigeria in 1999, you have personally played an important part in the adoption by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union of the Conference on Security, Stability, Development and Cooperation in Africa (CSSDCA). In 2000, the OAU adopted the Plan of Action setting up the CSSDCA at its summit in Lomé. In this plan of action, Nigeria, with other OAU member states, also committed to """"condemn genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes in the continent and undertake to cooperate with relevant institutions set up to prosecute the perpetrators."""" Dating back to 1996, the OAU Council of Ministers expressed its dedication to accountability for serious human rights crimes by endorsing a """"Plan of Action Against Impunity in Africa"""" adopted by the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights earlier that year.   The Rule of Law and a Lasting Peace   As the United Nations Secretary-General reaffirmed on 11 March 2003, without justice, there can be no lasting peace. Charles Taylor's past record of broken promises provides little basis for optimism that providing Taylor with safe haven will contribute to long-term stability or security in the region. As you know, less than two months after leaving Liberia, Taylor already was accused of interfering in Liberia's affairs from his new base in Nigeria.   It would be a tragedy if Charles Taylor were to live out his life in exile and luxury, like former Ugandan dictator Idi Amin, never facing a court of law. By the same token, bringing Taylor to justice would be a victory for the people of Liberia, Sierra Leone and indeed Africa, and an important step in restoring peace and the rule of law to the troubled region.   Continuing to provide Taylor with safe haven when he is an indicted war criminal flies in the face of Nigeria's expressed commitments to end impunity. We believe that Nigeria should honor its commitments to justice and abide by its obligations under international law by delivering Taylor to the Special Court. The victims of Sierra Leone's brutal civil war deserve no less.   Sincerely,   Kenneth Roth Executive Director   Cc: H.E.

The directors urge the Department of Defense to investigate Mr. Arar's case, in light of U.S. law as well as obligations under international law. November 17, 2003 Mr. William J. Haynes, II General Counsel Department of Defense 1600 Defense Pentagon Washington, DC 20301-1600  Dear Mr. Haynes:  We are writing to you to express our deep concern over the reported role of United States officials in transferring a Canadian citizen, Maher Arar, to Jordan with the understanding that he would then be turned over to Syria. Mr. Arar alleges that he was brutally tortured by Syrian authorities over a period of 10 months. As you may be aware, these allegations are contained in a front-page story on November 5, 2003 in the Washington Post. Mr. Arar claims that he strenuously protested being handed over to Syria and expressed the strong fear that he would be tortured there. We urge you to investigate his allegations, to report publicly on your findings, and to hold accountable any US officials who may have violated US law and human rights commitments in his case. On June 26th in a statement commemorating UN Torture Victims Recognition Day, President Bush pledged that the United States is leading the fight against torture by example. He called upon all governments to join the United States in “prohibiting, investigating, and prosecuting all acts of torture….” These statements reinforced the even more specific assurances you provided in your letter to Senator Leahy on June 25, 2003 stating that “United States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the receiving country that it will not torture the individual being transferred to that country. We can assure you that the United States would take steps to investigate credible allegations of torture and take appropriate action if there were reason to believe that those assurances were not being honored.”  Independent of these pledges, the United States has obligations under both the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment and US law to refrain from sending any individual to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being tortured. The United States has long protested the use of torture in Syria. Indeed, in the President’s November 6th speech to the National Endowment for Democracy he specifically mentioned the problem of torture there.  We urge the Administration to make good on these pledges and comply with its legal obligations by swiftly and thoroughly investigating this case and taking appropriate action against those responsible if the allegations prove correct. If Mr. Arar was in fact treated in the way he describes, it raises very serious questions over whether US officials have violated United States legal obligations and the President’s pledges. In addition, either US officials failed to obtain the “appropriate assurances” you discussed in your letter to Senator Leahy, or the Governments of Jordan and Syria violated those assurances.  There are many aspects of Mr. Arar’s report that are troubling. First, of course, is the allegation that US authorities actively participated in sending an individual to a country known to use torture when interrogating prisoners despite his fear that there was a substantial likelihood that he would be tortured. This report is similar to earlier reports that US officials participated in the transfer to Syria of a prisoner seized in Morocco. In this case, however, the individual was allegedly detained in the United States and then transported by US officials. It is not clear that even receiving assurances of proper treatment from a government like Syria that has a well-documented record of torturing prisoners would satisfy US obligations.  Second, it is not clear what legal basis exists for “rendering” an individual to another government in general or in this specific case. Mr. Arar is allegedly a Canadian citizen and resides there. He was reportedly traveling from Tunisia to Canada by way of New York City when US officials detained him and held him for two weeks before flying him out of the country. There is no allegation that he has been charged with or is being sought by any government for having committed a crime. Thus, it does not appear that he was extradited, removed or deported under any of those applicable statutory provisions in US law. In the absence of an express statutory authorization, US officials are not authorized to seize, detain, transport and surrender an individual to a foreign state.  Third, the Washington Post article quotes anonymous Bush Administration officials who appear to contradict the Administration’s public statements concerning the abuse and rendition of prisoners. In this instance, anonymous officials claim that the United States has engaged in “a lot of rendition activities” and that one of the reasons for these renditions is the desire to place suspects “in other hands because they have different standards….” While we appreciate the Administration’s repeated public assurances that suspects are not being transferred to other countries so that they will be abused in order to extract information from them, the repeated claims of unnamed Bush Administration officials involved in actual cases raise serious questions about whether the President’s policy against torture is being violated in practice. Those concerns are bolstered by the comments of former US intelligence officials, such as Vincent Cannistraro and Robert Baer, who have said publicly that they believe that transferred suspects are being tortured.  We call on the Administration to undertake a swift and thorough investigation into Mr. Arar’s case and to make public the results of that investigation. We also urge the Administration to investigate and publicly respond to the repeated public claims of past and present intelligence officers that the United States is participating in many prisoner transfers and that transferred prisoners are known to be tortured. Finally, we urge the Administration to end the practice of transferring persons to countries where it cannot effectively assure that they will be free from torture or other mistreatment. We look forward to hearing from you concerning this matter.  Sincerely,  William F.

Urged to Review Privations of First-Year Conscripts","11/13/2003","Conscript soldiers in Russia performing their first year of compulsory military service are routinely denied adequate food and access to medical care, Human Rights Watch said in  a report released today. The average Russian soldier is sick and hungry,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Yet, the Russian government fails to even acknowledge the problem, let alone address it.” On November 17, the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights will scrutinize Russia’s record on economic, social and cultural rights, including the rights to adequate food and health care. The 40-page report, “To Serve Without Health: Inadequate Nutrition and Health Care in the Russian Armed Forces,” details how conscripts are deprived of adequate food. The diet of conscripts often lacks meat and green vegetables, and falls short of the Russian military’s own nutritional standard for soldiers. The food they do receive is often of poor quality, rotten, or bug-infested. The hazing system that has made Russia’s military notorious also prevents junior conscripts from getting enough to eat, as senior conscripts confiscate younger conscripts’ most desirable food. Violent hazing in the military also discourages many first-year conscripts from seeking medical care for minor health problems, as they fear repercussions from senior conscripts. In some cases senior soldiers harass and beat conscripts after they seek medical care. In others, conscripts’ commanding officers and even doctors deny conscripts’ requests for medical care. In some dramatic cases, this treatment has led to the death of conscripts or permanently damaged their health. For example, Viacheslav Turov, a nineteen-year-old conscript from the Siberian city of Novokuznetsk, died in 2001 from complications of double pneumonia after only three and a half months in the military. Early in his service, he had complained about losing seven kilograms in just a few weeks because of an inadequate diet. The post-mortem report identified malnutrition as having contributed to his death. Violent hazing continues in many on-base sickbays and in some military hospitals, where senior soldiers beat or otherwise ill-treat first-years, or force them under threat of abuse to perform a variety of humiliating chores. In at least one case, the victim committed suicide after a night of particularly cruel treatment. Human Rights Watch calls on the Russian government to take the following steps to stop these abuses: Restore the effectiveness of enforcement mechanisms set out in the Code of Military Conduct aimed at ensuring that soldiers receive an adequate diet, monitoring their health,and ensuring effective access to health services when necessary. Conduct investigations to determine why existing enforcement mechanisms are not effective.  Institute mechanisms to ensure the protection of soldiers’ rights; hold accountable all officers and lower ranking personnel who infringe upon any soldier’s right to adequate food or health care, or who interfere with state and military mechanisms to protect and enforce those rights. Establish a permanent monitoring mechanism, possibly by creating an ombudsman for military servicemen, to ensure the existing standards are consistently and appropriately implemented. Ratify the European Social Charter.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Health, Health Care Access"

Bush that no detainee at Guantánamo Bay be tried in proceedings that fail to meet international standards of due process, Human Rights Watch said today. “The detainees have been held far too long without any kind of legal process,” said Wendy Patten, U.S. advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “But the military commissions proposed by the Bush administration will not provide a fair trial.” Following the announcement in July that two Britons were among the first six detainees President Bush declared eligible for trial by military commission, the British government raised serious concerns about due process. The U.S. government agreed to suspend proceedings against the two British nationals, Moazzam Begg and Feroz Abbasi, until these concerns were resolved. The U.S. and Australian governments are involved in similar talks regarding an Australian national, David Hicks, who is also among the first six detainees slated for possible trial by military commission. The talks thus far have failed to yield progress on the most serious deficiencies in the structure of the military commissions. The British government has obtained little beyond assurances that the two Britons will not be subject to the death penalty and that the U.S. government will not eavesdrop on their conversations with their lawyers. Blair has indicated that the two Britons may be repatriated if the two governments fail to reach agreement on the British government’s remaining concerns. While repatriation would avoid trial by military commission for these two men, it would do nothing to address the fundamental concerns about due process raised by the proposed military commissions before which the remaining Guantánamo detainees may be tried. Human Rights Watch insists that no one be tried by the proposed military commissions unless the rules are changed to ensure fair trials. Among the principal due process problems are: Lack of independent appeal – Detainees tried before military commissions will not be allowed access to independent civilian courts for review of any convictions and sentences. Trial results will be reviewed by military review panels, then by U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and, ultimately, by President Bush. Review of trial decisions, no matter how erroneous or arbitrary, will remain wholly within the military chain of command. By contrast, U.S. service members tried by courts martial may appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and then to the U.S. Supreme Court. The failure to provide this same right of appeal to those detainees who should have been classified as prisoners of war is a violation of the Third Geneva Convention.  Restrictions on an effective defense – The military commissions’ rules place numerous restrictions on the ability of defense lawyers to mount an effective defense. Among the most important restrictions are: infringing upon the defendant’s right to counsel of choice by requiring him or her to accept a military defense lawyer as part of his or her defense team; monitoring attorney-client conversations; failing to guarantee access by a civilian defense lawyer to all of the evidence against the defendant or to all of the proceedings in the case; and prohibiting defense counsel from talking to the press or the public about the case without prior permission from military officials. Improperly subjecting civilians to military jurisdiction – The military commissions will be permitted to try persons who were never combatants and whose connection to armed conflict may be tenuous at best. For example, a non-U.S. citizen living in the United States who has financially contributed to al-Qaeda could be prosecuted before a military commission for “aiding and abetting” the enemy. With U.S. courts fully functioning, there is no justification for subjecting civilians to military trial and violating their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. “Trials of the Guantánamo detainees must be scrupulously fair, both to protect the rights of the accused and to ensure the legitimacy of any verdict in the eyes of the world,” said Patten. For nearly two years, the United States has held detainees at its naval base in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Nine Britons are among the approximately 660 persons detained by the United States at Guantánamo. The Bush administration claims the detainees are all enemy combatants who are not entitled to prisoner of war status, even though the U.S. government has refused to afford them individual hearings to determine their status, as required by the Third Geneva Convention. By contrast, the U.S. government conducted over one thousand such hearings during the 1991 Gulf War and has conducted numerous such hearings in Iraq since the recent armed conflict. The Bush administration continues to oppose judicial review of the detentions at Guantánamo. On November 10, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether U.S. courts should be open to hear claims of unlawful detention by Guantánamo detainees.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, United Kingdom",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/12/food-political-tool-zimbabwe","Food a political tool in Zimbabwe","Food a political tool in Zimbabwe","","11/12/2003","Only one-quarter of the funding needed to feed southern Africa in the coming year has been received by the World Food Programme. The need for food aid in Zimbabwe is so great that it alone will absorb two-thirds of these funds. But even if the organisation’s southern African programme eventually receives full funding, hunger in Zimbabwe will persist. Zimbabwe’s food crisis is not simply a consequence of grain shortages. In Zimbabwe, people are hungry because food is a political weapon. Human Rights Watch fielded a research mission in Zimbabwe in February to investigate food distribution by both the government and international relief agencies. Despite the closed political environment and the pervasive reluctance of Zimbabweans to speak about food and land issues, Human Rights Watch found evidence that both the government’s subsidised food programme and international relief efforts were biased by political manipulation. Perceived political adversaries of the ruling Zanu (PF) or the government encounter obstacles in gaining access to food. Members of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), top the list of perceived enemies. But this category also encompasses teachers, former commercial farm workers and urban residents — groups generally considered to favour the MDC. In effect, without a Zanu (PF) party card one cannot register for or receive government-subsidised grain. Local authorities are also able to manipulate the international relief efforts. In some cases international agencies must rely on local authorities’ information to determine beneficiary status and register aid recipients.  According to insiders of the international aid regime, political concerns of donor governments also affect distribution. These sources indicated that some international donors oppose funding food relief for those resettled on the former commercial farms, which were redistributed under Zimbabwe’s land reform program. International aid agencies deny that political opposition to land reform is a factor, explaining that they cannot distribute relief food in these areas until the government completes an overall needs assessment. Yet both the former farm workers and the resettled farmers are hungry and cannot gain access to food. The government should instruct authorities in charge of beneficiary lists to abide by nondiscrimination laws. The government should impress upon the leadership of all political parties that it is prohibited for politicians and party supporters either to use food to influence or reward constituents and voters, or to withhold access to food as reprisal for perceived political opposition. Punitive action should be taken against those who flout this prohibition. International relief agencies have made considerable efforts to fight politicisation of relief food through tight controls on food distribution and to implement all aspects of relief efforts directly or through local nongovernmental organisations.  The international aid community and the donor countries that fund its programmes should not be influenced by any factor other than need. They must expand operations into the resettled commercial farm areas where some of Zimbabwe’s most vulnerable people are in dire need. Donors that have withdrawn support for humanitarian programmes in Zimbabwe should reconsider their duty to assist the countless people plagued by hunger.","Africa, Zimbabwe",""

Nhial Bol, former managing editor and reporter at the Khartoum Monitor, Sudan’s only daily English-language newspaper [see in Background section below], fled Sudan to Kenya in late October following repeated government actions against the Monitor, and arrests and threats against his life. The Monitor was shut down several times this year by the government, most recently in September. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned the Sudanese government’s attacks on the independent media. On November 1, Bol received an emergency grant from the Hellman/Hammett fund for persecuted writers, which is administered by Human Rights Watch. Last year the Monitor received one of the annual Hellman/Hammett grants after continual closings by security forces and spurious court proceedings by the Sudanese government threatened the newspaper’s existence. Bol intends to move to southern Sudan and start a newspaper in the territories of the rebel Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A). Ongoing peace negotiations to end the 20-year civil war between the SPLM/A and the government should be finalized by the end of the year. The United States has played a major role in mediating these peace talks. Under the peace agreement, a regional government will be formed in the south, with the SPLM/A as the dominant party. As a rebel group, the SPLM/A has had no track record of handling an independent press, because the rebel area lacks suitable communications and infrastructure. As it becomes a key player in the regional government, however, its performance will be watched closely. “An independent press will have a critical role to play in the future of Sudan, both in the south as well as the north,” said Jemera Rone, Human Rights Watch’s Sudan researcher. “The international community needs to support Nhial Bol and other journalists like him so that they can continue to shine a light on human rights abuses.” Nhial Bol was managing editor of the Monitor since its founding in 2000. The only English-language daily in the country, the newspaper served Khartoum’s large southern Sudanese population and reported on matters related to peace and dialogue between northern and southern Sudan. The newspaper’s articles on the peace process between the government and the rebel SPLM/A, human rights abuses by security forces, slavery, and the treatment of southern Sudanese aroused the ire of the Khartoum government, which subjected the Monitor and the rest of Sudan’s independent newspapers to censorship, intimidation and confiscation. Bol was arrested on dozens of occasions by government security forces. After the government-controlled National Press Council in February instructed newspapers not to report on the peace process, there was a new wave of crackdowns against the independent press. Monitor reporter Edward Tersu Lado was arrested and detained for 10 days in March, and a Khartoum criminal court in May shut down the Monitor for two months. In June, the Court of Crimes Against the State, a Sudanese security court, revoked the Monitor’s publishing license permanently, found Bol and reporter William Ezekiel guilty of crimes against the state, and fined the newspaper 400,000 Sudanese dinars (US$1,554). After being allowed to reopen on September 13, the newspaper was ordered shut down again two days later. The Khartoum Monitor remains closed. Each year, Human Rights Watch presents Hellman/Hammett grants to writers around the world who have been targets of political persecution. The grant program began in 1989 when executors of the estate of Lillian Hellman asked Human Rights Watch to design a program in her name and that of her long-time companion, novelist Dashiell Hammett, to provide assistance to writers in financial need as a result of expressing their views.","Africa, Sudan",""

The Chinese government announced on November 7 that it will provide antiretroviral drugs to all rural residents with HIV/AIDS and to urban residents experiencing """"economic difficulties."""" But Human Rights Watch warned that other elements of the Ministry of Health's """"five promises on AIDS work,"""" particularly the increased crackdown on drug users and sex workers, could open the door to systematic human rights abuses that would compromise the effective delivery of AIDS drugs. """"Providing antiretroviral drugs to poor people is a great step forward,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"But draconian crackdowns against people at high risk of HIV will only drive them underground and make it less likely that they will come forward for testing and treatment."""" The promise of antiretroviral drugs was but one of """"five promises on AIDS work"""" announced by Chinese Deputy Minister of Health Gao Qiang. Another commitment is to expand the crackdown against injection drug users and sex workers, two of the groups at highest risk of HIV infection. A recent Human Rights Watch report, """"Locked Doors: The Human Rights of People Living With HIV/AIDS in China,"""" showed that China's current harsh policy toward drug users includes arbitrary detention without due process, forced labor, detention in unclean and overcrowded facilities, and mandatory testing for HIV without informing detainees of the test results. """"China should repeal laws requiring forced detoxification, and work together with drug users and sex workers on HIV prevention and AIDS care,"""" said Adams. """"They are important allies in the fight against a burgeoning AIDS epidemic."""" A further commitment is to protect the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, but the Ministry of Health fails to say how it will do so. Human Rights Watch's recent report found that discrimination is widespread in Chinese hospitals and clinics. Many hospitals refuse to admit as patients people living with HIV; in Yunnan province, Human Rights Watch found that a hospital AIDS ward was closed and padlocked, barring all people with HIV/AIDS. People living with HIV/AIDS lack any means to seek redress because there is no national antidiscrimination law. In Henan province, the Chinese government has yet to address a scandal in which hundreds of thousands-or perhaps a million or more-villagers contracted HIV through state-run blood collection centers. In May, HIV-positive villagers in Henan were beaten and jailed when they protested lack of access to care. """"China urgently needs a national law barring discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS, and should establish a mechanism through which victims of discrimination can file complaints,"""" said Adams. """"How will the Chinese government give out medicine if the patients can't even get in the hospital?"""" Speaking at Beijing's Tsinghua University yesterday, former U.S. President Bill Clinton called on China to pass an antidiscrimination law protecting the rights of people living with HIV/AIDS. Tsinghua University scholars have repeatedly pressed for national legal reform to protect from discrimination people living with HIV/AIDS. Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the apparent downward revision of China's official estimate of the numbers of people living with HIV/AIDS in China. In 2001 the Ministry of Health estimated that there were 800,000 people living with HIV/AIDS in the country. Six months later, UNAIDS announced that there were as many as 1.5 million. In 2002, after international criticism, China revised its estimate up to 1 million people living with HIV/AIDS. As recently as September 2, Assistant Foreign Minister Shen Guofang said in Bangkok in a speech to the U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific that there were 1 million people living with HIV/AIDS in China. This month, without explanation, the Ministry of Health suddenly revised the estimate down to 840,000. Many observers estimate that there may be as many as 1 million cases in Henan alone, and China's application to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria also disclosed in six other provinces percentages of HIV infection higher than previously reported.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/11/08/human-rights-abdullahs-greatest-challenge","Human Rights- Abdullahs Greatest Challenge","Human Rights: Abdullah’s Greatest Challenge","","11/08/2003","Malaysia´s first new prime minister in more than 20 years, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, faces scores of challenges after succeeding Mahathir Mohammed on Friday. But none will be greater than those necessary to transform Malaysia from an authoritarian regime into a nation that respects human rights and operates under the rule of law. A critical first step would be to protect those members of society whose rights have consistently been under attack: migrant workers and those who defend their rights. Two million foreign migrant workers – predominantly from Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines– reside in Malaysia. Less than half work there legally. Increasingly, they are women who find employment within private homes, in factories or on plantations. Malaysia´s export-oriented economic strategy has relied heavily on the labour of foreign workers, who comprise about 10 per cent of the total workforce. Government estimates suggest that illegal migrant workers comprise up to 70 per cent of the labour force in manufacturing and construction, sectors that have driven Malaysia´s economic growth. After 22 years in power marked by a remarkable rise in standards of living, the Mahathir government has left a legacy of excessively punitive policies and practices that often deny basic rights to migrant workers – especially those without full legal status – and stifle the work of human-rights groups investigating alleged abuses. A stark example is the October 16 conviction of Irene Fernandez, a leading advocate for the rights of women and migrant workers, for publicising human-rights abuses in Malaysia. In 1995, Tenaganita (Women´s Force), a nongovernmental organisation led by Fernandez, issued a report documenting beatings, sexual violence and inadequate food and water in immigration detention camps. Instead of prosecuting the prison guards allegedly responsible for these abuses, however, the government targeted Fernandez under the restrictive press laws for “maliciously publishing false news”. Fernandez´ seven-year trial, the longest in the country´s history, became a symbol of the government´s hostile stance towards human-rights defenders. It drained the resources of one of the country´s few organisations addressing the needs of migrants, whose legal status and poverty renders them particularly vulnerable to abuse. Fernandez is an internationally recognised human rights advocate, who has worked to reform laws on rape and domestic violence, provide support services to women trafficked into forced labour and sex work, and create programmes to improve health and awareness for HIV-positive women. What reward did Dr Mahathir´s government confer upon this activist who has worked tirelessly for social justice? Twelve months in prison. Years of being called to court. Increased monitoring and harassment. And a clear warning to others who dare to speak up about state violations of migrants´ rights. In the face of this repression, local human rights groups and women´s organisations have courageously expressed defiance. As Fernandez observed after her conviction: “Other Malaysian NGOs are becoming vocal about the incidence of state violations of human rights. There is more solidarity between organisations because of this development.” Another worrying development was the amendment last year of Malaysia´s immigration law and tough enforcement measures to provide for caning, fines, imprisonment and mass deportation of undocumented migrant workers. Local nongovernmental organisations report that migrant workers suffer poor conditions in detention facilities, violations of due process and lack of access to health care. The country´s punitive immigration law deters migrant workers from reporting or escaping abusive employment situations, but it fosters impunity for exploitative employers. Women domestic workers, because of their isolation in private homes, are particularly at risk of abuse and often have no options for redress. Arbitrary quotas and high registration fees create ample opportunities for extortion by government officials and private agents. With the retirement of Dr Mahathir, Malaysia has a chance to redefine itself as a rights-respecting nation. Mr Abdullah should take the opportunity to promote reforms that protect the rights of migrant workers. He should also endorse laws that abide by international human-rights standards, such as the Migrant Workers Convention, a UN human rights treaty that entered into force in July. Mr Abdullah should also request a pardon for Fernandez and focus his government´s attention on pursuing human-rights abusers instead of harassing human-rights defenders. He can either obstruct the important work of human-rights groups, or create an environment where they can operate freely. The choice he makes will tell us much about what kind of Malaysia he intends to govern.

Efrain Rios Montt, a retired general, is seeking the presidency of Guatemala. In the early 1980s he headed a military regime that carried out hundreds of massacres of unarmed civilians and -- according to a U.N.-sponsored truth commission -- """"acts of genocide."""" Now Rios Montt is attempting to return to power, and as part of his campaign has even displayed a picture of himself with Ronald Reagan that was taken in the '80s. The U.S. Embassy has pointed out that this photo was taken in a different context, and indeed it was. The context was the Cold War, and the Reagan administration, concerned about leftist insurgencies in Central America, was seeking congressional approval to restore direct military aid to Guatemala. Reagan posed with Rios Montt, praised him as """"a man of great personal integrity"""" who was """"totally dedicated to democracy,"""" and dismissed charges of atrocities in Guatemala as a """"bum rap."""" As Reagan spoke, Rios Montt's troops were preparing to march on a village called Las Dos Erres for a counterinsurgency operation that was to include the rape of young women, smashing of infants' heads and the interment of more than 160 civilians -- some while still alive -- in the village well. Now the skeletons have been exhumed from the well in Las Dos Erres, as well as from hundreds of other clandestine cemeteries scattered throughout the countryside. A truth commission has documented tens of thousands of abuses committed by the Guatemalan state, as well as a much smaller number committed by leftist guerrillas. And in 1999 President Clinton issued a public apology in Guatemala for the U.S. role in supporting that country's abusive regimes. The apology came backed by aid -- millions of dollars that the U.S. government has invested in efforts to promote the rule of law in Guatemala, including the truth commission, an extensive U.N. peacekeeping mission and the litigation of human rights cases. And what does Guatemala have to show for these efforts? Only two major human rights cases have resulted in convictions of senior army officers. And these came only after witnesses were assassinated and investigators, judges and prosecutors forced to flee the country. (Both convictions were subsequently overturned on dubious grounds and remain under review in the courts.) Neither Rios Montt nor his fellow officers have been tried for the massacres of the 1980s. Although the public prosecutor's office has opened a formal investigation into charges that they committed acts of genocide, it has moved at a snail's pace. Meanwhile, the general is running for president and stands a decent chance of forcing a runoff with the rightist politician who is the frontrunner. Whoever wins the election, the country's most pressing problem will remain its perilous journey toward the rule of law after the years of repressive violence that peaked under Rios Montt's previous rule. The biggest obstacle to recovery is the existence of a shadowy network of private, illegally armed groups that appear to have links to both government officials and organized crime. They are powerful, ruthless and apparently responsible for scores of threats and attacks against rights activists, justice officials, journalists and others. Given these groups' ability to corrupt and intimidate, it would be easy to conclude, as many have, that the situation in Guatemala is hopeless. But it isn't. At least not yet. A new initiative has emerged that could offer Guatemala its last best opportunity to restore the rule of law. This year the Guatemalan government and civil society leaders agreed to support the creation of a special U.N.-sponsored commission to investigate and promote the prosecution of these groups. To be successful, this commission will require substantial support -- political and economic -- from the United States and the rest of the world. Without adequate resources and personnel, the commission is likely to fail, a failure that could make things in Guatemala even worse, with half-baked investigations leading to the acquittal of dangerous criminals and reinforcing the climate of impunity in which they thrive. Given Guatemala's position as both the largest economy in Central America and a major transshipment point for the illegal drug trade, any further deterioration of the country's rule of law could have implications far beyond its borders. If, on the other hand, the commission succeeds, it could serve as a useful model for other countries in the region. Two decades after supporting Rios Montt, the United States should do all it can to help Guatemala clean up the human rights disaster it helped create. The context may have changed, but the wounds have not healed.","Americas, Grenada, United States",""

(Arabic) In the 40-page report, Security Forces Abuse of Anti-War Demonstrators, Human Rights Watch documented excessive use of force by security forces to disperse demonstrators protesting the U.S.-led war against Iraq in March, violating their right to freedom of assembly. After arresting hundreds of protesters, police then beat and mistreated many detainees, some to the point of torture, and failed to provide medical care to persons seriously injured. """"Plainclothes officers viciously attacked protestors with pipes and clubs, and arrested demonstrators and bystanders without cause. Then the jailers beat those they considered to be the ringleaders,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government has an obligation to carry out an impartial inquiry and hold accountable those responsible for this brutal behavior."""" On March 21, following a massive but largely peaceful public protest the previous day against the Iraq war, Egyptian security forces attacked would-be demonstrators and bystanders in and around Cairo's Tahrir Square, beating many with clubs and pipes, arresting persons arbitrarily and preventing them from gathering to protest U.S. and Egyptian government policies. Later the same day, plainclothes security forces attacked a peaceful sit-in at the headquarters of the Egyptian Bar Association, where they beat and arrested a number of defense lawyers and two members of parliament. """"The government should make public the names of these security officials who were responsible for ordering, carrying out or condoning these attacks,"""" Stork said. Most of the some 800 persons arrested that day were released within 24 hours, but 61 were held for investigation and charged with destruction of property, promoting disorder and other offenses. Over the following weeks, other alleged activists and demonstration leaders were detained unlawfully, and some were tortured in detention. Most were subsequently released, but the charges against them have not been dismissed. Human Rights Watch called on the government to dismiss charges against persons detained solely for attempting to exercise their right of free assembly. """"If the government has any evidence of criminal wrongdoing, it should promptly bring those persons to a fair trial,"""" Stork said. Ashraf Ibrahim, an engineer and antiwar activist, goes to trial on December 16 before a Higher Emergency State Security Court on charges of, among other things, """"sending false information to foreign bodies-foreign human rights organizations-which include, contrary to the truth, violations of human rights within the country."""" Security forces arrested him on April 12 and held him for nearly four months before the Higher State Security Prosecution Office indicted him on August 7 under Egypt's emergency legislation.

Fernandez, one of Malaysia’s most prominent advocates for the rights of migrant workers and women, was denied a passport on November 4. On October 16, the Kuala Lumpur magistrate’s court convicted Fernandez of “maliciously publishing false news” for issuing a groundbreaking 1995 report that documented beatings, sexual abuse and inadequate food in detention camps for migrant workers. Her one-year jail sentence has been stayed pending appeal. Over the course of the seven-year trial, the longest in Malaysian history, Fernandez applied for—and received—a passport 42 times. The prosecutor urged the court to deny Fernandez’s most recent request for a passport on the grounds that she would likely “tarnish the image of the country” if allowed to speak about Malaysia’s human rights situation at international conferences, which she is scheduled to attend this month in the United States and Canada. The magistrate’s court agreed with the prosecutor and rejected Fernandez’s application, although the prosecutor conceded that Fernandez was not likely to flee. Fernandez is appealing the decision. Human Rights Watch urged the government to withdraw its objection to the issuance of the passport when the case goes to the Kuala Lumpur High Court. “Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi should take this opportunity to show that Malaysia can and will tolerate criticism,” said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “Fernandez was sentenced to a year in prison for speaking out against abuses. Now the government is adding insult to injury by keeping her from traveling abroad for the same reason. This does not bode well for free expression in Malaysia.” Although the prosecution of Irene Fernandez began under the government of Mahathir Mohamed, who stepped down as prime minister on Friday, October 31, her case is a test of how Abdullah’s government will address free expression. Mahathir’s government harassed and sometimes jailed its critics, and restricted civil society groups and the media. In his opening speech as prime minister, Abdullah stressed the need for free expression in Malaysia. “We believe democracy is the best system of governance,” he told the Malaysian parliament on November 3. “We must be open and ready to accept criticism and contrary views to ensure that a culture of democracy thrives.” “Prime Minister Abdullah needs to live up to his rhetoric,” Adams said. “He can signal the beginning of a new era of openness in Malaysia, or just continue with Mahathir’s policies. Malaysia’s image will be tarnished if Irene Fernandez is forced to stay at home.” Fernandez is scheduled to attend a conference on human rights defenders in the United States and a conference on HIV/AIDS in Canada. The conference in Canada is being held by the International Council of AIDS Service Organizations, of which Fernandez is a board member. The conference in the United States is co-sponsored by the Carter Center, founded by former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, and the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Human rights activists from around the world will attend the conference.","Asia, Malaysia","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Domestic Workers, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

An August peace agreement ended fourteen years of civil war in the West African nation. As vital defender of the rule of law in Liberia, Tiawan Gongloe has often spoken out against government and rebel abuses at great personal risk. In April 2002, he was detained without charge and tortured after giving a speech on the role of non-governmental groups in bringing peace to the region. “During the darkest days of Liberia’s civil conflicts, Tiawan Gongloe was a beacon of hope,” said Binaifer Nowrojee, counsel with Human Rights Watch’s Africa divison. “Without Mr. Gongloe’s courageous intervention, many political detainees, journalists, and other victims of abuse would have languished in prison – or worse.” President Charles Taylor, a former warlord in power from 1997 until his August 2003 exile to Nigeria, systematically silenced all critical voices. During this time, journalists, political opposition and human rights activists came under attack and were regularly subject to violence at the hands of Taylor’s security forces. Taylor regularly manipulated the courts to bring politically-motivated criminal charges. As the rebel incursion worsened, the Taylor government became ever more heavy-handed. As critics began to flee the country for fear of their lives, Mr. Gongloe stayed. Whenever an organization or an individual came under attack by the government, Mr. Gongloe was there, indefatigably appearing in court and speaking out publicly. “Liberians in trouble always knew Tiawan Gongloe’s door was open,” said Nowrojee. In April 2002, Mr. Gongloe was arrested without charge and detained overnight in police custody. By the following morning, he had been brutalized so severely he was unable to stand. His body and head were badly bruised, he was urinating blood, had lost some hearing in his left ear and one of his eyes was bloodied. In the morning, when he was taken again for police interrogation, he was unable to stand or sit as a result of his injuries. Lawyers who had been notified of his whereabouts finally pressured the police to hospitalize him. Although no charges were ever brought, Mr. Gongloe was arrested for a speech he gave at a March 2002 conference in neighboring Guinea on peace in the region. The speech dealt with the important role of civil society groups in the attainment of peace. He also condemned the use of violence as a means to state power. The same day Mr. Gongloe was arrested, the government closed down The Analyst newspaper, which had just printed a copy of the speech. Mr. Gongloe’s arrest prompted a local and international outcry. With pressure from Human Rights Watch and others, the government did transfer Mr. Gongloe to a hospital. Fearing that he would be rearrested and tortured again on his release from the hospital, Human Rights Watch helped organize for Mr. Gongloe and his family to leave Liberia. He is currently based in Philadelphia, where he is recuperating. “Tiawan Gongloe embodies the hope for justice and stability for so many Liberians,” said Nowrojee. “The nation will need citizens with his incredible courage and strength to rebuild.” As of November 2003, Liberia remains volatile. Despite the arrival of West African and U.N. peacekeepers, and the deployment of a transitional government in the capital Monrovia, fight still continues in some area. Outside urban areas, ragtag government militias and fighters from both rebel groups—Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the splinter group of ex-LURD members called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL)—continue to terrorize civilians. Hundreds of thousands of Liberians remain displaced. In some areas, killings, abductions, rapes, and looting by fighters from all sides continues. When the security situation stabilizes, Mr. Gongloe intends to return to Liberia to help rebuild the nation’s shattered justice system. “What Liberia desperately needs today is to rebuild a culture of respect for human rights and the rule of law,"""" said Tiawan Gongloe. “That is my mission.”","Africa, Liberia",""

Bush should end the transfer of detainees to countries that routinely engage in torture, such as Syria, if he is to fulfill his pledge to champion democracy and human rights in the Middle East and honor the United States' international legal obligations, Human Rights Watch said today. In a November 6 speech to the National Endowment for Democracy in Washington, President Bush condemned the government of Syria, along with Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq, for leaving its people """"a legacy of torture, oppression, misery, and ruin."""" According to the U.S. State Department's annual human rights reports, Syria torture methods include beatings, administering electric shocks, pulling out of fingernails, forcing objects into the rectum, and bending detainees into the frame of a wheel and whipping their exposed body parts.  Yet last year, the United States reportedly transferred Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian citizen, to Syria after having detained him in New York as he was en route from Tunisia to Montreal. On November 4 in Ottawa, Arar publicly asserted that, while held in Syrian prisons for 10 months, he was repeatedly tortured by being whipped with a thick electric cable and threatened with electric shocks.  Since September 11, 2001, the Bush administration has reportedly facilitated or participated directly in the transfer of numerous persons without extradition proceedings, a practice known as """"irregular rendition,"""" to countries in the Middle East known to practice torture routinely. """"Denouncing torture in Syria, and then handing over prisoners to Syrian torturers sends the ultimate mixed message,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Bush Administration cannot effectively promote change in the Middle East and elsewhere unless the United States is seen as a credible and consistent champion of human rights."""" Expelling, returning or extraditing a person to a country where there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would be subjected to torture is a violation of the Convention against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, a treaty that the United States ratified in 1994.  The Bush administration has acknowledged this obligation, and asserts it does not render suspects if it believes it is likely that they will be tortured. The U.S. Defense Department General Counsel, William Haynes, on June 25 wrote to U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy: """"Should an individual be transferred to another country to be held on behalf of the United States, or should we otherwise deem it appropriate, United States policy is to obtain specific assurances from the receiving country that it will not torture the individual being transferred to that country. We can assure you that the United States would take steps to investigate credible allegations of torture and take appropriate action if there were reason to believe that those assurances were not being honored.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the United States to promptly investigate Maher Arar's allegations, including the conduct of U.S. officials and the legality of his detention and subsequent transfer to Syria. The U.S. government should publicly report on its findings and hold accountable those responsible for unlawful actions.  """"This case shows that diplomatic assurances about the treatment of detainees are often hollow and are not being effectively monitored,"""" Malinowski said. """"The Bush administration has an obligation under its own policy to investigate these allegations and take appropriate action.""""  It also urged the Bush administration to institute a moratorium on the rendition of persons to countries that routinely use torture until it has undertaken a broader review of the U.S. practice with regard to renditions. The review must examine the nature of the assurances the United States receives from countries prior to transfer, the steps it takes to ensure persons are not abused after rendition, and the actual fate of those who have been turned over to countries known to practice torture.  Before it lifts the moratorium, the United States must also ensure that its practices are consistent with U.S. and international law, and that procedures are in place to protect transferred detainees from being subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.","Americas, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Canada, Syria",""

Stauring mobilized a local interfaith coalition in June to protest abuses against youths in the Men’s Central Jail, leading the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to declare that the jail was unfit for detainees under the age of 18. Stauring’s decision to speak publicly cost him the opportunity to minister to detainees in Men’s Central. Citing privacy concerns, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department revoked Stauring’s access to the jail on June 20, 2003,one day after he criticized detention practices for youths in the jail. Although the county now plans to move the youths to more suitable facilities, Stauring’s status remains unresolved. “Javier’s shown great courage in speaking out on behalf of an unpopular group, and he’s remained true to his convictions in the face of reprisals,” said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. “In doing so, he’s reminded lawmakers that treating detained kids inhumanely benefits nobody—not the youths themselves, not the adults who are charged with their care, and not the communities to which they will one day return.” When Human Rights Watch began an investigation of the Men’s Central Jail earlier this year, it found that youths in the jail are generally locked in windowless single cells for 23 1/2 hours each day. In addition to a 30 minute period each day to shower and make telephone calls, they have three hours of recreation once each week in individual rooftop cages containing a pull-up bar and a telephone. Other than these periods, family and attorney visits, and trips to the nurse, they remain in their cells with little or nothing to do. There is no classroom instruction in the jail; instead, youths see a teacher for five to 15 minutes each through the cell bars two or three times a week. Jail staff told Human Rights Watch that state education laws required only one hour of face-to-face instruction per week, but the jail does not meet even that minimal requirement. In addition, the jail does not make an effort to identify youths with special education needs, in violation of federal law. Harsh detention conditions may have contributed to three suicide attempts by youths since the end of May. One youth tried to kill himself on June 30. Two others attempted suicide on or about May 24; one of these boys had a history of mental illness and had earlier attempted to kill himself while in police custody following his arrest. These suicide attempts prompted Stauring to go public with his concerns, suggesting that the suicide attempts were “a direct result of youth routinely being locked in their cells for 23 1/2 hours a day” and urging an end to the “inhumane practice of incarcerating juveniles” in adult jails. In response, the sheriff’s department revoked his clearance to minister at all adult county jails because, it said, he had disclosed confidential information about youths in detention. Stauring has served as a chaplain at the Central Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles since 1995 and is now co-director of detention ministries for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, a position he has held since January 2003. He also serves as policy director for Faith Communities for Families and Children, a Los Angeles-area interfaith coalition that advocates on behalf of youths in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Human Rights Watch staff members work closely with these brave individuals as part of our defense of human rights in more than 70 countries around the world. The 2003 Human Rights Watch Annual Dinners in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco will honor: Dr. Aida Seif El-Dawla, for her work to combat torture and promote women’s rights and freedom of association in Egypt; Tiawan Gongloe, for defending the rule of law and human rights during Liberia’s violent civil war; Javier Stauring, for fighting to improve detention conditions for youths tried as adults in the United States. Human Rights Watch is a nonprofit, international monitoring group with headquarters in New York. We accept no financial support from any government. Brief biographies of the three honorees follow: Dr. Aida Seif El Dawla, Egypt: For three decades, Dr. Aida Seif El Dawla has actively fought for human rights in Egypt and the Middle East. In 1984, Dr. Seif El Dawla was a founder of the New Woman Research Center, which played a key role in challenging the obstacles to women’s liberation in Egypt. She also fought religious fundamentalists’ efforts to force women -- literally and figuratively -- back into a veiled position in society. -Dr. Seif El Dawla is also an active advocate against female genital mutilation, a practice that in the early 1990s affected an estimated 97 percent of married Egyptian women between the ages of 15 and 45. In 1993, Dr. Seif El Dawla helped found the El Nadim Center for the Psychological Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence. The first and only organization of its kind in Egypt, El Nadim focuses on helping men, women and children tortured by Egyptian police and security forces, and has also developed an independent program for the treatment of female victims of all forms of violence. More recently, Dr. Seif El Dawla was named chairperson of the Egyptian Association Against Torture, a group she helped found. The association uniquely provides legal, medical, and social services to ensure victims of torture and their families receive necessary support. The association also monitors and reports on cases of torture, and presses for prosecutions and legal change. Tiawan Gongloe, Liberia: Tiawan Gongloe is one of Liberia’s leading human rights lawyers. During the 10 years he has worked with Human Rights Watch, he has defended political detainees, independent journalists, human rights activists and victims of abuse in Liberia’s 14-year civil war. Both in and outside the courtroom, Mr. Gongloe is a well-known voice in Liberia, regularly commenting in the media or at meetings on human rights issues. Before his August 2003 exile, Liberia’s then president, Charles Taylor, attempted to silence all critical voices. During this time, journalists, the political opposition and human rights activists were regularly subject to violence at the hands of Taylor’s security forces. Many fled for their lives. But Mr. Gongloe stayed to defend persecuted colleagues. In April 2002, he was arrested without charge and detained in police custody. By the following morning, he had been brutalized so severely he was unable to stand. Following pressure from local and international groups, the government transferred Mr. Gongloe to a hospital. Fearing that he would be rearrested and tortured again on his release from the hospital, Human Rights Watch helped organize for Mr. Gongloe and his family to leave Liberia for the United States. When the security situation in Liberia stabilizes, Mr. Gongloe intends to return to his country to help rebuild the nation’s shattered justice system. Javier Stauring, United States: Javier Stauring is a Catholic lay chaplain who has worked to improve the conditions in which juvenile offenders are incarcerated. Mr. Stauring has served as a chaplain at the Central Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles since 1995 and is now co-director of detention ministries for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles. He also serves as policy director for Faith Communities for Families and Children, a Los Angeles-area interfaith coalition that advocates for youths in the juvenile justice and child welfare systems. Shocked by abusive detention conditions for children in Los Angeles’s Men’s Central Jail, Mr. Stauring mobilized and led a local coalition to press for change. After the coalition publicized abuses in the jail, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors declared the Men’s Central Jail was unfit for detainees under the age of 18. However, when he spoke at a protest in front of the jail and questioned whether conditions contributed to two May suicide attempts, the sheriff’s department -- in an apparent act of retaliation -- revoked his clearance to minister to the youths at Men’s Central. Mr. Stauring has worked effectively to promote creative approaches to crime prevention, alternatives to incarceration, and systemic change of the juvenile justice system.","Africa, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Liberia, Egypt",""

Security Council Member Facilitates Atrocities","11/05/2003","(New York, November 5, 2003) – The government of Guinea violated the United Nations arms embargo on Liberia and supplied weapons that Liberian rebels used to commit atrocities, Human Rights Watch charged in a briefing paper released today. “It’s appalling that Guinea — a current member of the Security Council — has flouted the arms embargo on Liberia,” said Lisa Misol, arms researcher with Human Rights Watch. “The Security Council must hold Guinea accountable for this major breach.” The briefing paper, """"Weapons Sanctions, Military Supplies, and Human Suffering: Illegal Arms Flows to Liberia and the June-July 2003 Shelling of Monrovia,"""" documents the bloody assault on Liberia’s capital, Monrovia. The Guinea-backed rebel group, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), fought forces loyal to Liberian President Charles Taylor. In the final offensive in July, LURD indiscriminately shelled civilian areas. Scores of people were killed, and at least 2,000 more — overwhelmingly civilians — were injured. Human Rights Watch investigated the supply of the mortar rounds fired by LURD, which accounted for many of the casualties, and found that the rebel offensive was possible only because fresh arms supplies arrived through Guinea. Guinea’s Ministry of Defense ordered mortars and other ammunition from Iran and arranged their onward transport to LURD. “Guinea has blood on its hands,” said Misol. “By supplying munitions to the Liberian rebels, it not only breached an arms embargo, but also became complicit in egregious violations of the laws of war.” One of the areas of central Monrovia hit worst in the shelling was the U.S. Embassy compound, where thousands of displaced people sought refuge. The U.S. government traced some of the mortar rounds to Guinea, which is a recipient of U.S. military aid. Human Rights Watch called for a suspension of U.S. and other military assistance to Guinea, in light of its longstanding ties to LURD and reports that arms continue to flow across the Guinea border for use by the rebels—despite the embargo. On Thursday the Security Council will discuss a report by a U.N. panel of experts investigating sanctions-busting in Liberia. The panel repeatedly has raised suspicions about Guinea’s role in the Liberian civil war. In the briefing paper, Human Rights Watch directly implicates Guinea’s Ministry of Defense in illicit arms supplies to Liberia. The former government of Charles Taylor and a second rebel group, the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), both of which like LURD have a dismal human rights record, also were able to obtain weapons despite the arms embargo, often with the help of regional allies. In August a flight carrying an arms shipment for Taylor’s government was intercepted in Monrovia. The seized container was recently opened, and more than 22 tons of small arms and munitions were found. “The Liberia example shows that arms embargoes are only as good as their enforcement,” Misol noted. “Liberia’s fragile peace depends on a reinvigorated response to sanctions-busting on all sides.” A peace deal for Liberia was signed in August after Taylor left for exile in Nigeria. A transitional government of national unity took power in Liberia on October 14. The warring factions have committed to disarm, but skirmishes have broken out and the potential for renewed hostilities remains.","Africa, Guinea, Liberia","Arms, United Nations"

The November 4-10 visit of Ambeyi Ligabo, the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, is the first by a U.N. expert on freedom of expression to Iran since 1996. Under the mandate created by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the special rapporteur gathers information on discrimination and threats or use of violence and harassment against persons seeking to exercise, or promote the exercise, of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. The Kenyan diplomat will meet with Iranian government representatives, journalists, academics and civil society groups. """"The U.N. Special Rapporteur has gone to Iran at a time when speaking freely incurs grave risks,"""" said Joe Stork, acting director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Iranians need to know that the international community will hold the government to account."""" In the week leading up to Ligabo's visit, many Iranians have been attempting to highlight systematic repression of freedom of expression by the judiciary branch. Mohsen Armin, an outspoken member of the Iranian Parliament's Commission for the Oversight of the Judiciary, said on November 3 that the Commission had heard testimony from numerous individuals who had been detained for expressing views critical of the government. Testimony was also heard from defense attorneys representing those jailed for their opinions. Armin's comments came days after the October 28 release of a report by the parliament's Article 90 Commission, which hears individual complaints of violations of the Constitution committed by branches of government. The commission's report investigated the death of Iranian-Canadian photojournalist Zahra Kazemi, who died of a brain hemorrhage from a blow to the head suffered in custody. The report identified Tehran Chief Prosecutor Said Mortazavi and other members of the judiciary branch as being directly involved in subjecting Kazemi to violent interrogations in the capital's Evin Prison and later attempting to cover up the cause of her death. The report noted that Kazemi had applied for and received official government permission to act as a journalist and photographer while in Iran in June and July, which highlights the risks faced by journalists working in Iran today. """"When Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize, the first thing she said was that freedom of expression is the most urgent human rights issue in Iran,"""" said Stork.

The case that was just decided, like the other cases from this period under investigation, is being pursued by the Special Prosecutor's Office. That office, created by President Vicente Fox in November 2001, is responsible for investigating and prosecuting human rights violations committed under previous governments. The special prosecutor's first attempt to indict former officials was dealt a major setback in March when a federal judge refused to issue arrest warrants, arguing that the time allotted by the statute of limitations for the crime had expired. The Supreme Court today unanimously rejected this ruling. The Court found, instead, that the statute of limitations on abduction does not begin to run if the victim's body remains missing. The victim in this case was Jesus Piedra Ibarra, the alleged leader of the guerrilla group Liga 23 de Septiembre. He was allegedly abducted by police and intelligence agents in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1975, and his body has never been found. The Ibarra case is one of hundreds currently being investigated by the Special Prosecutor's office. In July, Human Rights Watch released a report, Justice in Jeopardy, that showed how the Special Prosecutor's Office has been seriously undermined by a lack of resources, limited access to declassified documents and a lack of cooperation by the military.

Dr. Seif El Dawla’s pioneering work provides torture victims not just solace and care, but also the tools to work for justice.  At least 13 people have died as a result of torture by Egyptian police and security forces since March 2002. Thousands of men, women, and children live with the physical and psychological scars wrought by electroshocks, beatings, suspension from ceilings, and sexual violence. Neither the police who commit the torture nor their supervisors who condone it are punished. “Everyone in Egypt knows torture is commonplace, but those who speak out face the risk of torture themselves,” said Clarisa Bencomo, researcher in Human Rights Watch’s Children’s Rights Division. “Dr. Seif El Dawla’s work breaks that silence, and gives victims and their families the support they need to begin healing. She also helps victims file legal complaints and claim compensation.” Aida Seif El Dawla is a founder and chairperson of the Egyptian Association Against Torture. The Association uniquely combines networking with nongovernmental organizations providing legal, medical, and social services to ensure that victims of torture and their families receive necessary support. The Association also monitors and reports on cases of torture, and lobbies both for prosecutions and legal and social change. In August 2003 the government rejected the Egyptian Association Against Torture’s application for nongovernmental organization (NGO) status, asserting it violated Egypt’s highly restrictive NGO law without saying why. The vaguely worded NGO law gives the government unprecedented powers to dissolve NGOs and imprison and fine those who operate unauthorized associations. “Dr. Seif El Dawla’s steadfast commitment to combating torture and other human rights abuses is an inspiration to her fellow activists in Egypt and abroad,” said Bencomo. “Their resolve to continue to challenge repressive legislation is keeping alive hope for civil society in Egypt.” This is not the first time Dr. Seif El Dawla has put herself at risk in defense of human rights in Egypt. She stood out as a whirlwind of energy as activists rallied to protest mass arrests and torture of anti-war demonstrators in March and April 2003. She documented victims’ injuries, arranged for their legal defense, and even demonstrated in front of Egypt’s Prosecutor General’s office demanding medical care for those still in prison. In 1999 Dr. Seif El Dawla was part of a nationwide campaign against an earlier version of the current NGO law, and held a one-week hunger strike to lobby the government-dominated parliament to reconsider the law. “Successive Egyptian governments have become accustomed to using the threat of arrest and torture to stifle peaceful dissent,” said Bencomo. “We hope that honoring Aida Seif El Dawla’s passion for justice will give courage to others to join in calling for an end to torture and impunity.” Background on Dr. Aida Seif El Dawla: For three decades, Dr. Aida Seif El Dawla has actively fought for human rights in Egypt and the Middle East. Born into a politically active family in the 1950s, she came of age at a time when the Egyptian government was pursuing limited economic and social reforms while severely restricting civil and political rights. “Before I had entered university I had seen my father arrested twice, and two other family members arrested as well, all for the unforgivable ‘crime’ of thinking differently and expressing what they thought and believed,” she says. These experiences encouraged Dr. Seif El Dawla to become involved in Egypt’s student movement in the 1970s, when she and others organized to address social, political and gender-based injustices. As a founding member in 1984 of the New Woman Research Center, Dr. Seif El Dawla played a key role in the development of strategies challenging the obstacles to women’s liberation posed by weak government policies. She also fought religious fundamentalists’ efforts to force women back into a—literally and figuratively—veiled position in society. Dr. Seif El Dawla is also an active advocate against female genital mutilation, a practice that in the early 1990s affected an estimated 97 percent of married Egyptian women between the ages of 15 and 45. In 1993 Dr. Seif El Dawla helped form the El Nadim Center for the Psychological Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence. The first and only organization of its kind in Egypt, El Nadim initially focused primarily on services for victims of state violence—men, women, and children tortured by Egyptian police and security forces—but later developed an independent program for the treatment of female victims of all forms of violence. That program is almost completely based on the work of women volunteers, and operates in several of Cairo’s poorest districts and in four other governorates in Egypt.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

Neither Ríos Montt nor his fellow officers have been tried for the massacres. In the seven years since the war ended, only two major human rights cases have resulted in the conviction of senior army officers. These rulings came only after witnesses were assassinated, and investigators, judges and prosecutors fled the country. Both convictions were subsequently overturned on dubious grounds and remain under review in the courts. The most pressing obstacle to progress on human rights cases has been the country's climate of political violence and intimidation. Rights activists, justice officials, journalists, and others who have promoted accountability have faced scores of threats and attacks over the past two years. There is a solid consensus among local and international observers that the perpetrators of many of these acts of violence and intimidation are affiliated with clandestine groups that have links to both state agents and organized crime. These groups threaten not only specific individuals and organizations, but also Guatemalan society as a whole, given their capacity to corrupt public institutions and undermine the rule of law. Earlier this year, the Guatemalan government, the national human rights ombudsman and civil society leaders agreed to support the creation of a special U.N.-sponsored commission to investigate and promote the prosecution of these groups. The current foreign minister, Edgar Gutiérrez, signed an agreement committing the Guatemalan state to establishing the commission, known as the Commission of Investigation into Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatuses (CICIACS). The proposal has strong support from the international community, including the United States. As a condition for its participation, the United Nations recently submitted recommendations to the Guatemalan government to strengthen the initial proposal.

Human Rights Watch warned that the initiative could backfire unless the Thai government respects the right of drug users to obtain services for HIV prevention, treatment, and care. The US $1,000,000 grant, announced on October 16 by the Geneva-based Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, aims to protect drug users from HIV by expanding education and outreach efforts among drug users’ social networks. The Thai government has consistently refused to support such services. Worse, it has engaged in a brutal crackdown against people suspected of smuggling and dealing drugs, resulting in the unexplained killings of several thousand drug dealers since February. Research by Human Rights Watch shows that anti-drug crackdowns can increase drug users’ chances of HIV infection. As with other populations at high risk of infection, such as sex workers and men who have sex with men, health experts fear that police brutality can push drug users into hiding and drive them from HIV prevention services. “Violent crackdowns won’t solve Thailand’s drug problem, but they will fuel its AIDS epidemic,” said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS and Human Rights program at Human Rights Watch. “Preventing HIV requires working respectfully with drug users, not trampling on their human rights.” Widely hailed as a “success story” in the fight against AIDS, Thailand has undermined many of its earlier achievements on HIV prevention since launching its anti-drug initiative on February 1. During the first phase of the crackdown, Thai police reported that approximately 2,700 alleged drug criminals were killed. Human rights activists allege that the government adopted a shoot-to-kill policy. Local authorities reportedly drew up blacklists of suspected drug dealers and gave police chiefs short deadlines to clear names from the list. Thailand’s Interior Minister, Wan Muhamad Nor Matha, said of drug dealers, “They will be put behind bars, or even vanish without a trace. Who cares? They are destroying our country.” The Global Fund grant provides funding for peer support programs among drug users, information and education on HIV prevention, and measures to increase drug users’ access to health care and HIV testing services. It also aims to increase the capacity of policy makers to promote HIV prevention services for injection drug users. As many as 60 percent of injection drug users in Thailand are thought to be infected with HIV. Human Rights Watch urged the Global Fund to closely monitor human rights abuses committed by the countries it supports. It recommended that the Global Fund demand an independent evaluation of the health impact of Thailand’s anti-drug initiative. Human Rights Watch also advocated that the Global Fund include human rights requirements in any financial assistance it provides directly to the Thai government and develop all future programs in Thailand with full attention to human rights. “The recent Global Fund grant provides a welcome contrast to the Thai government’s spine-chilling statements against people involved in drugs,” said Csete. “The challenge now is to ensure that the grant gets results.”","Asia, Thailand",""

He reckoned that he could sell 5kg of gold from his new mine for $50,000 (£30,000). He said it would be traded for guns. According to countless reports, those guns, in turn, are used to massacre civilians. Human Rights Watch has documented many of these attacks where men, women and children are brutally killed, raped or mutilated.   The drive to control the DRC's vast mineral wealth has been a prime motive for the war. Multinational companies and the DRC's neighbours are accused of profiteering from the war, yet the UN Security Council has taken no action. The war has left more than three million people dead in the past five years.   The DRC is blessed ­ or in this case cursed ­ with some of the world's largest diamond reserves, rich gold fields, as well as huge reserves of cobalt and coltan (a mineral used in laptops and mobile phones). All the warring parties have exploited these reserves to finance their military operations and buy weapons, often committing serious human rights abuses in the process. A peace process has begun but the deadly business practices persist.   Companies in Britain are among the 85 accused of ignoring fundamental principles and international standards of good practice as laid down in the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which spell out how companies should behave. And Britain has failed to investigate even one of them.   Britain has also failed to confront the DRC's neighbours, Uganda and Rwanda, who have funded and supported Congolese rebel groups. In the decade before Ugandan troops arrived in the DRC, for example, Uganda exported few diamonds but, once Ugandan soldiers were on the spot, it sold diamonds abroad worth millions of dollars. Rwanda multiplied its exports of coltan in the same way.   Uganda and Rwanda have now pulled their troops out of the DRC but they have reportedly kept their economic links with the warlords. It is precisely this murky trade that destroys Congolese lives and undermines hope for the peace process.   Looking the other way guarantees continued profits for a few and continued horror for the many.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Democratic Republic of Congo, United Kingdom",""

The biannual summit, hosted in Rome on November 6 by the Italian Presidency of the European Union, marks the highest-level bilateral encounter that takes place between the European Union and Russia. In a letter to EU heads of state and government, Human Rights Watch called on the European Union to engage in sincere and frank discussions of ongoing abuses in Chechnya and Ingushetia, and to seek concrete commitments from Russian President Vladimir Putin regarding protection for displaced persons, accountability for abuses, and access for international monitors to the conflict zone. “We know the European Union has long been concerned about human rights abuses in Chechnya,” said Rachel Denber, acting director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “But what’s really troubling is that it has consistently failed to impress upon its Russian counterparts the seriousness of these concerns.” Human Rights Watch also noted that the human rights situation in the northern Caucasus was but one of a number of issues that mar Russia’s record on human rights. Others include the treatment of conscripts in the Russian military, threats to freedom of expression, and rising xenophobia. But what dominated Human Rights Watch’s concerns were the continued abuses perpetrated against Chechen civilians in Chechnya and Ingushetia, and the blatant disregard demonstrated by the Russian government for its obligations under international and national law. In the weeks leading up to the summit, Russian authorities have continued their relentless efforts to compel internally displaced persons in Ingushetia to return to Chechnya, most recently targeting the Bella and Satsita camps. They have failed to remedy the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Ingushetia, where Human Rights Watch has recently found that Russian forces perpetrate the same abuses as they do in Chechnya, as the conflict spills over the border. This has made Ingushetia an increasingly unsafe place for displaced Chechens and Ingush civilians alike. The Russian government has also persisted in its failure to facilitate access to the region by international monitors, and to hold accountable perpetrators of abuses committed during the conflict. “EU leaders cannot continue to shy away from what may be an uncomfortable topic to raise,” said Denber. “They owe it to the hundreds of thousands of Chechens who suffer the consequences of this silence, and to the values the Union purports to stand for.” Human Rights Watch urged EU leaders to seek President Putin’s commitment to heed the following specific calls during the summit meeting: Implement the recommendations by the U.N. Representative of the Secretary-General on Internally Displaced Persons following his recent visit to the region, including “reaffirming” the Russian government’s commitment to “voluntary return[s],” and providing “dignified circumstances” to people in areas of displacement; Cease the closing of tent camps without providing alternative shelter that is reasonable and humane, and the policy of compelling displaced people to return to Chechnya under current circumstances; Ensure full access to camps for humanitarian organizations;  Take measures to address the deteriorating security situation in Ingushetia and ensure that any law enforcement operations conducted in Ingushetia conform to Russian and international law;  Respond positively to outstanding requests for invitations made by U.N. thematic mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteur on Torture and the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions; Set a firm date for the long overdue visit by the Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women;  Cooperate fully with the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Exposing the truth is more than half the battle when it comes to averting famine.   In many ways, the same is true of HIV/AIDS. The deadly epidemic thrives best where it can be shrouded in secrecy, where inaction or counterproductive actions by governments can be hushed up, and where the needs of those at risk and those living with the disease can be swept under any available carpet. Despite government promises of increased openness post-SARS epidemic, secrecy continues to be a hallmark of AIDS in China, where tens of thousands, maybe a million, maybe more -- impossible to know for sure -- have been stricken with HIV because officials conspired with private businesses to cash in on the highly profitable blood plasma of poor rural people. Some of those living with AIDS have been harassed and arrested for demanding that the state provide care and treatment. Stigma and abuse heighten the HIV risk faced by millions of other Chinese. And people courageous enough to speak out about the epidemic may land themselves in detention. The government has taken some positive steps in recent years. State agencies have launched some small-scale AIDS education and HIV prevention projects in the provinces and cities. Beijing has made positive policy statements about non-discrimination, though these lack the force of law. But these important steps don't go far enough. So many of HIV's potential victims are virtual sitting ducks, thanks to the Chinese government. Injection drug users face the highest risk and, according to a recent Human Rights Watch investigation, anti-drug policies add to that risk. Drug users are vilified, arrested and detained without due process. They're also forced to undergo repressive and ineffective detoxification """"treatment"""" that includes chanting of state-approved slogans. Detainees in detoxification centres are forced to labour without pay, making trinkets for tourists. Drug users not in detention are driven underground by fear and harassment. These abuses fling open the doors for HIV/AIDS to rush into the drug-using population. And the story is similar for sex workers and men who have sex with men, forced to live in secrecy or on the margins of society. For parts of the world where the AIDS epidemic is younger than in Africa or the United States, there is always the hope that lessons painfully learned in those places will benefit governments confronting newer epidemics. Here are some of the lessons: Universally available information and openness about the basics of HIV transmission, and care and compassion for people with AIDS, are a sine qua non. With every instance of abuse and repression against injection drug users, sex workers, and others at risk, those persons are marginalized and driven away from prevention services, and the virus gains a stronger foothold. But these lessons have been ignored in China. Even farmers have been turned into sitting ducks. The blood scandal -- China's own Plasmagate -- may turn out to be the biggest boost any government ever gave to HIV/AIDS in the history of the epidemic. After extracting the profitable plasma, blood collection centres run by Henan province officials pooled the remaining blood and re-injected it in the arms of donors, enabling them to give blood often without becoming anemic. The state spread HIV/AIDS across Henan -- and government documents reveal this also happened in six other provinces -- but not one official has yet been prosecuted for one of the world's worst blood scandals. There has been one exception: In August, Henan province health official Ma Shiwen was thrown in jail, but for """"circulating state secrets"""" or allegedly sending an official government report on HIV/AIDS to Chinese AIDS activists. Beijing must launch a full investigation, punish those responsible, and give treatment and compensation to the victims. Beijing officials do not have to go as far as Africa or the United States to study positive practices. They could start by visiting Hong Kong. Hong Kong offers subsidized antiretroviral drugs and medical care to all residents with HIV/AIDS. Hong Kong also has a Disability Discrimination Ordinance that protects them against discrimination, an Equal Opportunities Commission where victims of discrimination can seek redress, and a vibrant community of AIDS organizations. Some of these Hong Kong organizations want to take their decades of AIDS experience into the mainland, but have difficulty because of the culture of fear and secrecy in mainland China. Endorsement of these programs by Beijing would make a dramatic difference. It is time for the curtain of secrecy to be drawn open on AIDS in China.

The European Union is slated to decide whether to open formal membership negotiations with Turkey at the end of 2004. The European Union has made clear that outstanding concerns in human rights are the main issues that stand in the way. During his visit to Ankara on October 27 and 28, Roth met with Deputy Prime Minister and Human Rights Minister Abdullah Gül, Interior Minister Abdulkadir Aksu, and Parliamentary Human Rights Commission President Mehmet Elkatmýþ, as well as government officials and representatives of the parliamentary opposition. In his meetings, Roth welcomed the increased pace of legislative reform over the past 14 months, including politically sensitive measures such as the abolition of the death penalty, laws permitting broadcasting in minority languages, and provision of safeguards against torture for people detained under the Anti-Terror Law. Roth also noted the increased acquittal rate in freedom of expression cases, but told ministers that it was frustrating that prosecutors were still bringing charges against people for expressing peaceful opinions. In addition, he expressed concern that four parliamentary deputies were still in prison for legitimate political activity, that broadcasting and teaching in minority languages have not yet begun, and that human rights organizations are still being officially harassed as a consequence of the outdated and restrictive Law on Associations. Roth welcomed the marked reduction in certain forms of torture, such as electric shocks and hanging by the arms, but expressed concern about the persistence of other forms of torture, including severe beating. Hundreds of people have continued to report ill-treatment because official and independent monitoring of detention facilities are not sufficiently tight. “The best way to end this mistreatment is for the governors and prosecutors regularly to visit all police stations and gendarmeries in their area, and for the Interior Ministry to permit access by independent monitors, including bar associations,” said Roth. There was a high degree of agreement between Roth and the ministers in their analysis of the outstanding reform steps to be taken, but Roth urged Interior Minister Aksu to adopt a much more liberal approach to peaceful demonstrations. “Too often police intervene to stop peaceful demonstrations, frequently with violence,” he explained. “Obviously police must prevent demonstrators from committing acts of violence, but beyond that the presumption should be that demonstrators can exercise their right to peaceful assembly in areas where their message can be heard, including near government buildings, in public squares, and within commercial areas.” On October 28, at virtually the same time as Human Rights Watch’s meeting with the Interior Minister, police detained students gathering to march from Istanbul to Ankara in protest against education conditions.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

Human Rights Watch called on President Karzai to speak out against the violence and to take action to minimize the number of warlords and their proxies attending the constitutional convention. """"These attacks on political freedom are putting Afghanistan's future at risk,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"The drafting of a new constitution is a critical step in Afghanistan's reconstruction and is essential to protect the rights of the weakest members of Afghan society. What hurts the constitutional process today will hurt Afghans for a long time to come."""" Elections to select delegates for the constitutional loya jirga, or """"grand council,"""" began this month in regional centers around Afghanistan. Through November, regional representatives from the June 2002 loya jirga will meet to elect delegates for the constitutional loya jirga. Those elected will gather in Kabul in December for the loya jirga. A Constitutional Commission is currently finalizing a draft constitution that will be debated at that meeting. Human Rights Watch conducted dozens of interviews over the last three weeks documenting regional military commanders and troops threatening loya jirga candidates and regional representatives, issuing death threats, and nominating themselves for the loya jirga, in violation of a July 2003 decree from President Karzai forbidding military commanders and local government officials from attending the loya jirga. Human Rights Watch found that abuses had already occurred in the two provinces that held special early elections-Badakshan and Ghor. In both places, candidates were intimidated and threatened to keep them from taking part in the elections. In Badakshan, a nominated candidate who had received support from other candidates withdrew his candidacy after a senior commander, allied with former President Burhanuddin Rabbani, allegedly told him, """"Avoid nominating yourself, otherwise we will kill you and throw your corpse into the Kokcha river."""" Other candidates received similar explicit threats from commanders in Kandahar and Herat, and appear to have been intimidated by commanders in several other provinces. Human Rights Watch called on powerful local and national leaders to act responsibly, and order the men under their control to avoid interfering with local processes to elect loya jirga delegates. Human Rights Watch also urged President Karzai and the international community to work together to ensure that the constitutional loya jirga is not marred by the presence of warlords and other de facto strongmen, as was the Emergency Loya Jirga of June 2002. """"A stronger message needs to be sent to the warlords,"""" said Adams. """"President Karzai, the United Nations, and the entire international community have to make it crystal clear that-unlike last time-the warlords and strongmen will be kept out."""" Human Rights Watch called on President Karzai to ensure that procedures for investigating and remedying threats are met. """"President Karzai needs to tell all Afghans that if they order or commit acts of violence or intimidation they will not be allowed to participate in the loya jirga or next year's elections."""" Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to expand protection of vulnerable delegates and regional representatives by increasing the number of human rights monitors working around the country, establishing closer contact with persons and groups likely to face threats, facilitating the assistance of international peacekeeping forces in monitoring (where feasible), and reporting on local leaders implicated in threats. Human Rights Watch also encouraged UNAMA and the NATO leadership of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) to explore whether peacekeeping forces can be deployed in coming weeks to strengthen the protection of vulnerable persons during local elections.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The repeal of this repressive law should be the first step in opening Malaysia's tightly controlled political climate.   The outgoing prime minister, Mahathir Mohammed, handpicked Badawi as his successor. Badawi, a longtime civil servant who served as Mahathir's deputy for four years, inherits a government with a mixed record on human rights. After assuming power in 1981, the autocratic Mahathir used various repressive laws to silence or even imprison his critics. While during the past two decades many Malaysians enjoyed rising standards of living, they could not exercise basic political rights. """"Mahathir's human rights legacy is not one to be proud of. Badawi needs to do things differently on human rights,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Badawi has the opportunity to make Malaysia a leader in the region by promoting political and cultural pluralism."""" In its letter, Human Rights Watch urged the incoming prime minister to: Repeal the Internal Security Act. Passed in 1960, the Act allows the government to detain individuals indefinitely and without adequate procedural safeguards, and violates international human rights standards relating to due process and judicial review. Ensure the independence of the judiciary. During Mahathir's term in office, the government limited the judiciary's ability to carry out its core function of checking executive abuse of power, both by rewriting laws to prohibit judicial review and by the continuing intimidation of judges who rule against the government. End media censorship. Mahathir's government used both formal and informal means to censor the Malaysian media, and resorted on occasion to open intimidation of journalists. In January police raided the offices of Malaysiakini.com, one of Malaysia's leading independent news sources. Promote women's rights. Despite some progress, Malaysia has not provided women adequate protection under criminal and domestic law, particularly in regard to domestic and sexual violence. In addition, Human Rights Watch called on the Malaysian government to ensure the protection of the rights of association and assembly, to safeguard the rights of refugees and migrants in the country, to put an end to the government's prosecution of prominent rights advocate Irene Fernandez, and to free political prisoner Anwar Ibrahim, who preceded Badawi as deputy prime minister. """"Mahathir ran a paternalistic government that tried to decide what was right for the Malaysian people,"""" Adams said.

The first demonstration took place in the capital, Riyadh, on October 14, the opening day of a human rights conference organized by the Saudi Red Crescent Society under the patronage of the Minister of Interior, Prince Nayef. The Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia (MIRA), a London-based political opposition group, called for the demonstration. Police forcibly dispersed the demonstrators, who were advocating political reform and the release of political prisoners, and arrested 271 persons. The government announced that 83 of those arrested will face trial. Prince Nayef said on October 22 that the government will not tolerate public demonstrations and promised """"deterrent punishment"""" in the courts. """"Everyone in Saudi Arabia should be free to express his or her political views publicly and peacefully without being thrown in jail and put on trial,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The reality of the repression speaks louder than the promises of reform."""" Most of those arrested on October 14 were released """"after proving that they had been drawn into the crowd and acted out of curiosity,"""" an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Eighty-three others, including three women, were detained for questioning and trial on unspecified charges. An Interior Ministry spokesman denounced this group, stating that it """"does not reflect the reality of Saudi society"""" and """"is not compatible with Islamic values."""" The crackdown on the demonstrators, MIRA said on October 16, made it """"inevitable that the thinking has to be on the basis of comprehensive change and removal of this despotic regime."""" The Saudi exile group added that it would call for additional peaceful protests but warned that """"it will find it difficult to blame the parties that believe in the use of force"""" and that it """"will not hesitate to hold the state responsible for any acts of violence that might happen in future."""" On October 21, MIRA called for demonstrations two days later in Riyadh, Jeddah and seven other Saudi cities """"to denounce the injustice and the corruption in the kingdom."""" A massive and well-organized deployment of security forces on October 23 kept protesters away in each city. Reuters reported that police filmed pedestrians near a mosque in Jeddah that was designated as the gathering place for demonstrators, and security officials in plainclothes recorded license plate numbers. According to the daily Bahrain Tribune, in Riyadh """"police vehicles blocked access to side streets leading to the [designated] mosque … and pedestrians were turned away from the immediate vicinity of several of the mosque entrances. Checkpoints were set up on a main road leading to the neighborhood, and the police stopped some cars."""" One government official reported that 30 people were arrested in Jeddah, 31 in Dammam, and 13 in Ha'il. The government announced that those arrested would also be put on trial. Freedom of assembly is an internationally recognized basic right codified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which in Article 20(1) states: """"Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association."""" Saudi Arabia's Basic Law of Government, promulgated in 1992 and which the government describes as """"a bill of rights for the citizen,"""" fails to provide for freedom of peaceful assembly. Human Rights Watch urged Crown Prince Abdallah and other senior government officials to: Determine and make public the basis under Saudi law for the continued detention of some 150 demonstrators, and clarify if they are under investigation for alleged criminal offenses. Ensure that each detainee is provided all the rights under Saudi Arabia's new criminal procedure code, including the right to a lawyer during investigation and trial. Set forth the legal or administrative procedures that residents of the kingdom can utilize in order to exercise the right to peaceful assembly. Such procedures should enable, not hamper, the exercise of this right, and they should be consistent with internationally recognized human rights standards. Advocates of reform in Saudi Arabia have long pressed for freedom of expression, association and assembly. In January 2003, hundreds of Saudi citizens signed a petition, the National Reform Document that urged comprehensive reforms """"to strengthen relations between the leadership and the community."""" One of the requests was for a """"royal announcement"""" guaranteeing the rights of freedom of expression and assembly. Crown Prince Abdallah, the country's de facto ruler, received the petition and later met with a group of the signatories. Another petition in September 2003 criticized the slow pace of reform and the absence of popular participation in decision-making. It advocated election of the 120-member Consultative Council and observed that the lack of freedom of expression fostered the growth of intolerance and extremism.","Middle East/North Africa, Saudi Arabia",""

Donor countries should convene an international conference to devise a solution to the longstanding crisis. The two governments heralded the bilateral talks, held last week in the Bhutanese capital, Thimpu, as a “historic breakthrough.” “These talks between Nepal and Bhutan were neither historic nor a breakthrough,” said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy advisor at Human Rights Watch. “The bilateral talks have ignored the concerns of the international community and failed to provide a solution for the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal. Donor countries must insist on the full involvement of the international community in solving the refugee crisis.” The coalition of NGOs—Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the Lutheran World Federation, Habitat International Coalition and the Bhutanese Refugee Support Group—called on donors to urgently convene an international conference involving the two governments, refugee representatives, the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), and other relevant U.N. agencies to devise a comprehensive and just solution to the 12-year-long refugee crisis. More than 100,000 Bhutanese refugees—an estimated one-sixth of the population of Bhutan—have been living in camps in southeastern Nepal since the early 1990s when they were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality and forcibly expelled from Bhutan in one of the largest ethnic expulsions in modern history. After years of stalemate, the governments of Bhutan and Nepal in March 2001 agreed to conduct a pilot screening of the refugees in Khudunabari camp, which houses 12,000 refugees, to determine their identities and eligibility to return to Bhutan. The refugees were divided into four categories: Category I – bona fide Bhutanese citizens (just 2.5% of the refugees);  Category II – refugees who supposedly """"voluntarily"""" migrated from Bhutan (70% of the refugees); Category III – non-Bhutanese (24% of the refugees); Category IV – refugees who have committed """"criminal"""" acts, including those who participated in so-called """"anti-national"""" pro-democracy activities in Bhutan (3% of the refugees).  In August, a group of NGO representatives visited Khudunabari camp as part of a joint international mission to Nepal and India. The mission expressed grave concern about flaws in the screening process as it excludes UNHCR, fails to comply with international human rights and refugee standards, and risks leaving tens of thousands of refugees stateless. The mission also identified the refugees’ key concerns regarding repatriation to Bhutan. These include guarantees of safety and security, full citizenship rights, and return to original homes and properties for refugees returning to Bhutan. None of these conditions was addressed by the latest round of talks, said the NGOs. The NGOs had hoped that the 15th round of bilateral talks would answer some of the serious concerns about the ongoing screening of the Bhutanese refugees and plans for their repatriation. Instead, the NGOs pointed out the following shortcomings in the outcome of the talks: Both governments have rejected the strong appeals of the international community to involve an independent third party, preferably UNHCR, in the screening and repatriation process. The Bhutanese government repeated its position (announced at the 14th round of talks in May) that it would allow refugees in Categories I, II and IV to return. However, the talks failed to clarify the conditions under which the refugees would be readmitted. The Bhutanese government affirmed that refugees in Category II would have to reapply for citizenship in Bhutan after a probationary period of at least two years, even though the majority of them were forced to sign so-called “voluntary migration forms” when leaving Bhutan. The stringent and discriminatory nature of Bhutan’s citizenship laws, including the requirement that all applicants are fluent in the language of northern Bhutan, Dzonkha, could exclude many southern Bhutanese from reacquiring citizenship. The Nepalese government repeated their offer of citizenship for refugees in Category II, the supposedly “voluntary” migrants, who choose not to return to Bhutan. But the growing insecurity and instability in Nepal raise questions about the viability of this offer. Refugees in Category IV, including those who participated in peaceful pro-democracy activities, would have to stand trial in Bhutan if they returned, despite the absence of any guarantees of fair trials or due process in Bhutan. The talks gave no guarantees that refugees would be able to return to their original homes and properties or enjoy basic human rights protections and full access to social services, including education, all of which are critical conditions for sustainable return. The governments agreed that the screening would proceed in a second camp— Sanischare—without any assurances that the serious anomalies and inadequacies in the process would be addressed. The decision to continue the screening process camp-by-camp in the other 6 camps will further delay the process. It took over two years just to complete the screening in Khudunabari camp. The governments set a deadline of January 2004 for reviewing the appeals of refugees in Category III but failed to address the serious concerns of the international community regarding the flaws in the appeal process. These include: the absence of an independent third party to hear the appeals, the lack of transparency regarding the criteria for screening, and the extremely short timeframe for appeals. “The two governments look set to repeat all the mistakes of the initial screening in Khudunabari camp,” said Peter Prove, Assistant to the General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. “None of the fears of the refugees have been properly addressed, and the process could drag on for years, prolonging the suffering of the refugees.” In a move criticized by the NGOs, UNHCR announced earlier this month that it would begin phasing out assistance to the refugee camps in the absence of a just and lasting solution by Nepal and Bhutan. The NGOs called on donors to apply new pressure to Nepal and Bhutan and insist the two governments uphold the refugees’ rights and allow UNHCR to monitor the repatriation process. “For too long donor governments have offered tacit support to the bilateral process between Nepal and Bhutan,” said Eve Lester, refugee coordinator at Amnesty International. “Now they must recognize that this strategy has failed and international efforts are needed to find a comprehensive solution for the refugees.”","Asia, Bhutan, Nepal","Women's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Second, we wish that they would collect all the guns from the gunmen, so girls can go out and go to school. Third, we wish they would talk with families - girls are interested but some families won't let them go out. Yes, people are afraid of what would hap- pen from the gunmen if they allowed their girls to go to school. Of course they are afraid of men with guns or other groups,"""" she said.   """"Safia,"""" a student in the western town of Herat, has less to fear from the gunmen who continue to roam much of Afghanistan almost two years after the ouster of the Taliban. But, at the age of I8, she despairs about her future. Punished by Herat officials for writing an article saying that women, like men, should be able """"to go out, find a job in the highest posts and live in society,"""" Safia has stopped working as a journalist. """"You are wrong. We are not the Taliban,"""" the official told her. She replied, """"We should compare our situation with the whole world and not just the Taliban.""""   The gunmen who still hold Afghan women and girls hostage are not just ordinary criminals. They are soldiers, policemen and intelligence officers of local commanders and warlords, many of whom ultimately answer to high-level Afghan officials and who rule the country outside of the capital of Kabul. Many warlords were previously in power in the early I990s, before the Taliban seized power, and Afghans have not forgot- ten the abuses they committed then. As one woman in a rural area under the control of commanders loyal to political figure Abdul Rabb al-Rasul Sayyaf explained: """"We are afraid because we remember the past.""""   In Kabul, patrolled by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) now under the command of NATO, things are somewhat better. Still, women's representation in government ministries is severely limited, and women and men who seek to create new political parties or publicly criticize government officials have been intimidated and sometimes silenced.   Despite high hopes when the Taliban were driven from power, many Afghan women are now disappointed. Throughout Afghanistan, severe discrimination and sexual violence are still keeping Afghan women and girls marginalized - politically, economically and socially. Secretary of State Colin Powell declared in November 2001 that """"the recovery of Afghanistan must entail a restoration of the rights of Afghan women.... The rights of women in Afghanistan will not be negotiable."""" While conditions are better than under the Taliban, the Afghan interim government and international community have yet to deliver on the promises made to Afghanistan's long-suffering women and girls.   Gender-Based Violence   """"There are lots of men with guns looting and stealing money and raping the women. This is happening everywhere, including to our neighbors,"""" a rural woman said in March. """"We keep awake and walk around so that no intruders can come here.... Of course we are afraid. I have a young daughter, and I am a young woman.""""   In many areas of the country and even in some parts of Kabul, security forces are committing violent criminal offenses - armed robbery, rape, extortion and kidnappings.[1] In Paghman district, less than an hour's drive from Kabul, people are staying awake all night long, patrolling their property in shifts, to protect themselves from marauding soldiers and po- lice. In eastern and southeastern provinces and parts of Kabul, men and women recount harrowing stories of soldiers breaking into their homes, holding them hostage, stealing their valuables and sometimes raping the women and girls. Women, girls and boys have been abducted outside of their homes in broad daylight. In parts of Ghazni province, soldiers have reportedly kidnapped girls on the way to school.   """"Roya"""" was stabbed four times in her Kabul home by intruders she believes were police. When she told the men she had no more money to give them, they tore her baby from her arms and threw him to the ground. """"I didn't even let him walk fast because I was scared that he would fall down, so how could I bear to see this?"""" she said. Roya and her family left their home, which they own, and now rent a few rooms closer to central Kabul. She has given up her dream of driving. """"Still during the night I am scared,"""" she says. """"When I hear a noise, I see the faces of those men.""""   In addition to the terrible physical and psychological harm caused by the attacks themselves, women and girls suffer severe restrictions not imposed on males. In many parts of the country, these restrictions compromise the most basic freedoms: to seek education, to seek life-saving health care and, in some cases, even to leave the walls of the family compound. If women cannot move freely within their communities and country, they cannot play their full role in the country's political life, whether in shaping the imminent new constitution or actively participating in the planned 2004 elections. While the de jure discrimination imposed by the Taliban has ended in many places, life for too many women and girls in Afghanistan remains subject to de facto restrictions. """"We couldn't go out during the Taliban,"""" another woman in rural Paghman said. """"Now we are free and we can go out, but we don't.""""   Girls Not in School   Neither """"Farishta,"""" 13, nor her seven-year-old sister are in school in 2003. Their brothers can go, their mother explained, but the girls' school is several kilometers away and armed men had recently raped neighboring women. They could hear their neighbors screaming for help, Farishta said. """"We were afraid. The men had guns and we do not."""" Farishta and her sister can- not read; they spend their days working at home.   The return of girls to school has been one of the most lauded gains of post-Taliban Afghanistan. About I.I4 million girls are now enrolled, according to UNICEF, but millions more are not. In some areas, girls' participation rate is as low as 3 percent.   Cultural barriers are only one reason why. For many girls (and boys) there is no school nearby. When schools are far away, girls are disproportionately affected because parents are less likely to allow them to walk long distances, especially in dangerous areas. As a farmer explained in March: """"Those who do want to send the girls to school face all sorts of problems from the armed men. If a family does want to send girls to school, they have to keep in mind that the girls might be dishonored. Why? Because there are armed men who have no fear of God or fear of other people. They rob, they enter into houses, they loot and they touch women."""" Outside of Kabul, many families say that they value education but are unable to send their older girls to school, even where one is available, for fear they will be attacked or kidnapped. Many of these same families have sent their girls to school in Iran or Pakistan, where they were refugees during the civil war of the I990s.   In some parts of Afghanistan, access to education is further impeded by attacks on schools, often by groups opposed to the Kabul-based government. From August zoo2 to June 2003, in at least nine provinces there were more than 30 such attacks in which educational materials, tent and buildings were burned or bombed.[2] School attacks often coincide with the anonymous distribution of threatening leaflets in mosques or high-traffic areas, warning parents not to send girls to school or threatening Afghans working with the government, with foreigners or with """"infidels."""" Many schools have reopened after being attacked, and many teachers and girls bravely say that they will continue despite threats. Others, however, say they have been deterred.   Extreme Discrimination in Herat   Even where the threat of sexual violence looms less large, women are still being intentionally marginalized. In the western province of Herat, the local governor, Ismail Khan, provides women and girls with relative physical security but little else, restricting their access to work, civil society and transportation, and policing their dress and speech.[3] While girls and women have better access to education and are not beaten by authorities in the street as they were under the Taliban, Ismail Khan's government is policing virtually every aspect of their lives.   For women and girls in Herat, every decision of every day presents dangers or challenges. Unlike under the Taliban, they can now leave their homes during the day without being ac- companied by a close male relative (mahram). However, they still may not walk or ride in a car alone with a man who is not a close relative, even a taxi driver. A police task force patrols the city, arresting men and women who are seen together and are suspected of being unrelated or unmarried. Men are taken to jail; women and girls are taken to a hospital to undergo forced medical examinations to determine whether they have recently had sexual intercourse.   Women and older girls must wear a burqa or chadori; if they go without it, they may be harassed and threatened by the police as well as private individuals. Unlike in neighboring Iran and Pakistan, women are not permitted to drive cars and have been arrested for trying. They do not ride bicycles (Even if these acts were permitted, they would be impossible wearing a burqa.) A public transportation system hardly ex- ists, and where it does it is inadequate, leaving women and girls with few ways to get to school, work or the market, or to seek medical care.   Once a Herat woman arrives at her destination, she must conform her speech, behavior and appearance to Ismail Khan's restrictions and edicts, which she has no way to challenge. If she is a teacher, for example she must not let any hair escape from her headscarf shake hands with a man or shake hands with a man or criticize the government. If she works for a foreign organization, she must not ride in cars with foreign men or be seen talking too loudly and laughing with them-at least one woman has been arrested and detained for similar reasons. Students and professors at Herat University report that they fear discussing anything political. Women students, who are completely segregated from the men, have been castigated for wearing high-heeled shoes that make noise when they walk and for telling journalists that they want co-educational classes. Girls cannot study music or play sports.   At home, a woman or girl can expect no protection from violent or abusive family members-as in most parts of the country, fleeing from domestic violence or a forced marriage may result in her arrest and prosecution. She lacks any official means of contesting male family members' decisions about whom she will marry or whether she can attend school or work.   Few jobs are open to women in Herat, and Ismail Khan has pressured women not to work with international NGOs or for the United Nations, although these agencies need women to administer many of their emergency aid and reconstruction programs. At the same time, almost no women have been invited to work in the Herat government. Denying women and girls the opportunity to use their studies in effect makes a mockery of the right to education. According to one Herati: """"These things, these attitudes, mean that for the few women who have an education at the university - it is useless.""""   Many rules are aimed at keeping the sexes segregated, which affects women and girls differently than men by excluding women and girls from bodies where decisions are made, from civic and cultural activities, from work, and from equal education. The consequences of breaking these rules are also different for women than for men.   Price of Speaking Out   """"Women should be participating in policy, social and cultural things and throughout the community and the government,"""" said """"Mena,"""" a Herat university student. """"But women are just sitting there and listening. They should be able to create things that they want and give their ideas to others. Their ideas are important. Men and women's ideas are equal. Men should be respectful of women's ideas. But I don't know anyone who speaks her ideas freely now,"""" she explained.   Throughout Afghanistan, women and girls like Mena express a strong desire to participate in their country's civil and political life, to be able to speak freely, both publicly and privately, and to have a voice in government decisions - especially those that affect them. At present, warlords like Ismail Khan are not allowing ordinary women or men to take part in most decision-making processes, but this repression is falling doubly hard on women. Very few forums are open to women outside of Kabul, and those that are open are heavily censored by local rulers.   In Jalalabad, Laghman and Herat provinces, women have been targeted simply for speaking publicly or for speaking about and promoting women's rights. In March 2003, troops in an eastern province assaulted a teacher in her home the day after she read aloud a poem about women's rights at a ceremony commemorating International Women's Day. The troops reportedly told her: """"You are going out and teaching, and going to meetings and acting for women's rights. You are just a teacher. If you want to go to school, go and come back home, but don't talk to anyone about women's rights.""""   Attacks on women's rights activists not only punish the women involved, but also have a chilling effect on all women who wish to advocate on behalf of other women or participate in public affairs. Still, another activist, who had herself been threatened repeatedly, remained defiant: """"This is my duty and as long as I have blood in my body, I will not give up and stop work.""""   Amidst official proclamations that restrictions on women are part of Afghan culture and values, many women and girls say they want to participate in decisions about what their values and culture comprise. """"We don't want to live like European women,"""" said one. """"We want to live as humans. It is our right to live as human because we are humans just like men."""" For instance, in addition to wanting to work, study, speak freely and participate in the decisions that affect them, many say they would like to decide for themselves whether to wear the burqa as opposed to modest clothing that places far fewer constraints on mobility. But most, especially outside of Kabul, are not free to decide. In some areas, including Paghman district outside of Kabul and Herat city, soldiers, police and other armed men are actually enforcing the wearing of the burqa. In Jalalabad and Laghman, certain government officials have threatened to beat or kill women who do not wear it.   Sexual violence, and accompanying restrictions on women and girls' freedom of movement and access to education, make it harder for women to work. But even where they are not in direct physical danger, women face discrimination by employers, including government officials, and, especially in rural areas, a dearth of jobs even for women who could fill them. Several women in Jalalabad left their teaching positions in 2003 because the education department head, Abdul Ghani, had ordered teachers not to attend public occasions or meetings without his permission, intimidated women for speaking publicly about women's rights, harassed teachers in school for wearing lipstick and nail polish, and threatened personally to beat teachers seen outside without a burqa.   Necessary Tasks Ahead   Improving Afghan women's physical security is critical. """"When women are afraid to go out in the street, they can't take advantage of the theoretical freedoms that are now available to them,"""" says a Kabul-based gender expert. While some 5,000 troops of the new Afghan National Army have been trained, it is many years away from being able to guarantee the country's security. At present, the military faction Shura-e Nazar is dominating the Ministry of Defense and, thus, efforts to rebuild the army. The faction's dominance is also impeding the disarmament and demobilization of former fighters and commanders. Until the new army is functional, ISAF should be expanded outside of Kabul and regional warlords like Ismail Khan with terrible records on women's rights must no longer be entrusted with providing security. While increasingly recognizing the need to expand ISAF, states have yet to commit the requisite troops and resources.   But guaranteeing physical security alone, without ensuring other basic human rights, will not fulfill the promises made to Afghan women. The US and the international community, as major power brokers in Afghanistan, have put too little pres- sure on military leaders outside of Kabul to obey President Hamid Karzai's authority, to uphold human rights standards or to relinquish power. Karzai's own efforts to sideline regional commanders have not been particularly effective, partially be- cause of the lack of US support. While the warlords themselves are, of course, ultimately to blame, the United States and other foreign powers also bear responsibility for the actions of those they have propelled to power or for failing to take steps against other abusive commanders. Having ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in March, the Karzai government now faces the challenge of incorporating the convention's protections into law, and making them available to Afghan women and girls in practice. Women and men be able must participate in all aspects of governance and society without facing violence or discrimination. If women and girls continue to be marginalized, by warlords or policy, efforts at national reconstruction will fail.        [1] Human Rights Watch, """"Killing You Is a Very Easy Thingfor Us"""": Human Rights Abuses in SoutheastAfghanistan (New York, July 2003).

The article, published on October 23 by Venpres on the website, quoted Americas Division Executive Director José Miguel Vivanco as saying that “Venezuela enjoys full democracy and freedom of expression.” Taken out of context and used as a headline for an article defending the government’s proposed Bill on the Social Responsibility of Radio and Television, the quotation misinterprets the opinion of Human Rights Watch. At a recent breakfast in Washington with Venezuelan authorities, Vivanco offered strong criticisms of both the draft law and of the country’s other obstacles to freedom of expression. He noted that the proposed law contains repressive provisions that could stifle the public debate and foster self-censorship in the media. He also expressed concern about the recent confiscation of broadcasting equipment from Globovisión. Vivanco specifically rebutted remarks made by Jesse Chacón, Minister of Communications and Information, who said that there is no norm in Venezuelan legislation at present that penalizes criticism of government authorities (desacato). As Vivanco pointed out, the Venezuelan Supreme Court has expressly declared the desacato norms in the country’s Criminal Code to be constitutional. In doing so, the Court ignored Venezuela’s international treaty obligations to protect free expression. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly stated that Venezuelans enjoy ample margins of freedom of expression. It has pointed out that the country’s major newspapers and television channels are highly critical of or even opposed to the current government, and do not hesitate to express their views. Nevertheless, Human Rights Watch has also firmly opposed actions or legislation that might restrict this freedom. In a letter sent to President Hugo Chávez on July 1, for instance, Human Rights Watch criticized the investigations opened by the Ministry of Infrastructure against RCTV, Globovisión, Televen and Venevisión. Such investigations, Human Rights Watch stated, could encourage a climate of self-censorship. In the same letter, Human Rights Watch also expressed its concern about the proposed television and radio law. Human Rights Watch believes that, with a recall referendum currently under discussion in Venezuela, the democratic benefits of an open public debate are more than ever crucial. It therefore urges the government to firmly avoid infringing on the freedom that Venezuelans currently have to express their views.","Americas, Venezuela",""

In the briefing paper, “Russia’s ‘Spy Mania’: A Study of the Case of Igor Sutiagin,” Human Rights Watch said that the Sutiagin case was part of a broader pattern of dubious espionage charges brought against Russian citizens who were working with foreign contacts on sensitive issues that until recently had been under thorough KGB control. These issues include nuclear-waste dumping, environmental degradation, national defense preparedness and military technology. In the past eight years, the Federal Security Service (FSB)—the successor to the KGB—has pressed espionage charges along these lines against about a dozen people. Sutiagin, in pretrial custody at the FSB’s Lefortovo Prison in Moscow, is the only one of those similarly charged who remains in prison. “Four years of pretrial detention is excessive,” said Rachel Denber, acting director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Igor Sutiagin should be released immediately.” Four years ago today, FSB officers detained Sutiagin, an employee of the Institute of U.S.A. and Canada Studies, at his home in Obninsk, Kaluga province. Several days later, the FSB charged him with spying for U.S. military intelligence. In December 2001 the Kaluga Province Court returned the criminal case to the FSB, stating that procedural violations committed during the investigation made it impossible to rule on the case. The case recently returned to the courts, and a jury at the Moscow City Court is expected to start hearing the case later this year. Sutiagin faces a 12- to 20-year prison term if convicted. Leading Russian human rights campaigners have coined the term “spy mania” (in Russian, shpionomania) to describe the trend of dubious espionage cases. They believe the FSB has intentionally pressed false charges against these individuals to reclaim what it sees as its exclusive dominion over sensitive issues, and to impose new limitations on freedom of expression on these topics. In each of these criminal cases, the FSB systematically violated the defendants’ right to a fair trial: it put forward vaguely formulated charges, refused to verify claims that all information provided to foreign contacts came from the public domain, and based the charges on secret decrees that the defendants were not allowed to see. FSB officials publicly asserted the defendants’ guilt. In the Sutiagin case, a court ruled in December 2001 that the charges were so vaguely formulated that they were “impossible to understand.” “Spy mania” appears to have a prescriptive aim: to have a chilling effect on the wider community of journalists, scientists and activists who work on sensitive issues and to serve as a warning to them. Some of the “spy mania” defendants had told Human Rights Watch that their fellow journalists and researchers had become reluctant to engage in research or writing that could trigger the FSB’s suspicion. “The effect of these cases goes well beyond the individual defendants,” Denber said. “It fosters an atmosphere of self-censorship.” The paper furthermore called on the Russian government to take steps to strip the FSB of its powers to conduct criminal investigations and to run detention centers. Such reforms were among the accession criteria for Russia’s membership in the Council of Europe.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Must Address Corporate Role in War","","10/26/2003","The United Nations Security Council should insist that member states launch immediate investigations into the involvement of multinational corporations accused of profiteering from the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), said a leading group of nongovernmental organizations today. The Security Council on Thursday will examine the final report of a Panel of Experts examining illegal exploitation of natural resources in the DRC. The Security Council has failed to act on previous reports from the panel showing the link between the activities of multinational corporations and armed groups guilty of massacres and other atrocities. The war in the DRC is estimated to have caused the deaths of more than three million people, the highest death toll in terms of civilian lives since World War II. According to the Panel of Experts, established by the Security Council in June 2000, the drive to control natural resources was a major motive for the war. """"The Security Council can no longer ignore clear evidence linking the exploitation of resources to the war in the Congo,"""" said the nongovernmental organizations. """"It must insist that member states hold the companies and individuals involved to account, including companies based in Western countries. Business must demonstrate its commitment to change the way it operates in conflict situations."""" Despite criticism of the Panel of Experts, its central findings have been corroborated by a growing number of independent reports. Human rights groups have recently concluded that the desire to exploit DRC's mineral and economic wealth has been the biggest single factor in the continuing violence in eastern DRC. Natural resources have been exploited by all warring parties allegedly to finance the war and acquire weapons, often resulting in widespread human rights abuses against civilians. In an October 2002 report, the Panel of Experts alleged that 85 companies involved in business activities in Congo breached international norms, including the Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises formulated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). None of the governments participating in the OECD has yet investigated the conduct of any of the companies listed. Instead, several governments have pressured the Panel to remove from the list the names of companies registered in their jurisdictions or to declare that such cases have been resolved. """"It is not just the Security Council but also the governments of member states that must live up to their responsibilities,"""" said the nongovernmental organizations. """"They must conduct open and transparent investigations using the OECD process or other judicial procedures to clarify the role that companies have played in the conflict in Congo."""" The Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Luis Moreno Ocampo, has stated that his office may also investigate the way businesses have contributed to the prevalence of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the DRC. The Security Council should ensure that information gathered by the Panel is made available to the prosecutor to assist in his investigations. Since August 1998, the DRC has been enmeshed in one of Africa's most widespread wars, directly involving six other countries. The armies of Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi along with Congolese rebel groups were pitted against the DRC government, supported by Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. Under increasing international pressure, the bulk of the foreign armies have withdrawn from Congo in the past year but they left behind many vested interests and a network of economic ties. Illicit economic exploitation reportedly continues through armed groups linked to neighboring countries and corrupt government officials. """"The Security Council has heavily invested in the current fragile peace process in the DRC, but its efforts risk failure unless it also addresses the underlying economic motivations that have driven the war,"""" said the nongovernmental organizations.

From around the world came a huge wave of sympathy for the Nigerian woman who had been found guilty of adultery and sentenced to death by stoning. When she won her appeal on September 25, there was a collective sigh of relief - and another stream of requests for Human Rights Watch to comment on the verdict.  Human Rights Watch researcher Carina Tertsakian had just returned from a mission to states in northern Nigeria where Sharia (Islamic law) had been extended to cover criminal offenses. Tertsakian knew the issues cold, but she also knew that many reporters were chasing the wrong story. “Amina Lawal’s case deserves attention, and we are delighted at the outcome of her appeal, but hers is not the only case, nor is the punishment of stoning the only human rights problem in Nigeria,” says Tertsakian, who has worked at Human Rights Watch since 2001. “Much of the Western media has oversimplified the issue by focusing exclusively on this type of punishment under Sharia.” The more fundamental human rights issue in Nigeria is the dysfunctional justice system, Tertsakian noted. She also describes how dysfunction lies at the heart of how Islamic law is being practiced too. Amina Lawal, for example, was convicted in a trial that was seriously flawed and did not follow due process, even under the Sharia legislation. She was not aware of her rights and did not even have a defense lawyer until the appeal stage Tertsakian’s reports for Human Rights Watch have highlighted the absence of justice that underlies Nigeria’s many human rights problems. Impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations and the inability of victims to obtain redress are the common threads linking problems as diverse as killings by the security forces, vigilante violence, and ethnic and religious conflicts.  Amina Lawal’s case has helped raise awareness of the parlous state of Nigeria’s justice system, but these other human rights problems, which have claimed several thousand lives since 1999, are crying out for the same level of attention.  Tertsakian, 41, formerly worked at Amnesty International as a researcher on Rwanda and the Great Lakes region. She works out of Human Rights Watch’s London office. Her next report will focus on violations of freedom of expression in Nigeria.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/26/wrong-man-job","Wrong Man for the Job","Wrong Man for the Job","","10/26/2003","By Michael Bochenek and Marc Schindler, Counsels to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch Published in The Washington Post October 26, 2003 D.C. officials disclosed recently that their top candidate to run the District's juvenile justice agency is LaMont Flanagan, who headed the Baltimore City Jail for 11 years. That they would consider Flanagan for this job is symptomatic of the city's lack of attention to juvenile justice issues. Flanagan took charge of Baltimore's jail in 1991 after two decades of litigation had left that city facing fines it could not afford. It would be nice to report that Flanagan cleaned up Baltimore's jail, but when Human Rights Watch and the Youth Law Center investigated the jail in 1999, that was not the case. Youths held there faced daily threats to their safety. They were confined in poorly lit cells crawling with cockroaches and rodents. Frequent fights, sometimes encouraged by guards, led to lockdowns during which juvenile detainees were restricted to their cells for days or weeks at a time. Mental health services were minimal to nonexistent. Cells designated for suicide watch lacked important safety elements and contained numerous objects that a detainee could use to hang or injure himself. Flanagan reacted to the Human Rights Watch report by questioning its accuracy and denouncing it. When the U.S. Department of Justice completed its own investigation nearly three years later, it found that the jail was unsafe, that it provided inadequate medical and mental health care and that it failed to protect youth from harm in violation of their constitutional rights. The jail was directed to implement 107 specific measures to correct the abuses; changes are still being negotiated. If that sounds familiar, it's because the District's track record is so similar. After a class action lawsuit, numerous court orders and $3 million in fines, the District still is not in compliance with a 17-year-old consent decree requiring it to address problems plaguing the juvenile justice system. The system's repeated failures have had tragic results, including the deaths of 20 children under the city's supervision since 1998 and the brutal rape of a 12-year-old girl at Oak Hill juvenile detention center. At a contempt hearing in September, the District again requested more time to come into compliance with the consent decree, demonstrating its lack of urgency toward providing the District's troubled youth with adequate services. Even Mayor Anthony A. Williams has acknowledged the failures of his administration, saying, """"There hasn't been an embrace at the agency level of the issue. There hasn't been a sense of urgency."""" To address these longstanding problems, the District should do at least three things: First, it should comply with the requirements of the consent decree and ensure that youth are safe and receiving appropriate services at Oak Hill. Second, it should implement the recommendations made by the mayor's Blue Ribbon Commission on Youth Safety and Juvenile Justice Reform in 2001. In particular, the District should close Oak Hill and follow the lead of juvenile justice systems in Chicago and Missouri that use a network of small facilities and day programs to provide services that keep young people close to home and on the right path. Williams also should reaffirm his support of the commission's recommendations, including a commitment to reject misguided policies such as transferring youth to the criminal justice system, as some are suggesting. Finally, the District should reopen its search for a candidate to head the Youth Services Administration, with the focus on finding a proven leader with experience in implementing effective and innovative juvenile justice programming. The District's young people need effective prevention, intervention and development activities to help them grow into responsible adults. Now is the time to see that this happens.","United States","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

International relief agencies in Zimbabwe fail to ensure that access to food is based on need alone and is not biased by domestic or international political concerns. The 51-page report, """"Not Eligible: The Politicization of Food in Zimbabwe,"""" documents how food is denied to suspected supporters of Zimbabwe's main opposition party and to residents of former commercial farms resettled under the country's """"fast-track"""" land reform program. The report examines the widespread politicization of the government's subsidized grain program, managed by the Grain Marketing Board, as well as the far less extensive manipulation of international food aid. According to the report, government authorities and party officials of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) manipulate the supply and distribution of government-subsidized grain and the registration of recipients for international food aid. Though international aid agencies, including the World Food Programme, have gone to great lengths to prevent interference, this kind of manipulation remains a problem. International aid agencies must devote greater resources and attention to preventing the manipulation of recipient lists. The report also examines international community's tacit complicity in preventing food from reaching former commercial farm areas resettled under land reform. """"Select groups of people are being denied access to food,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is a human rights violation as serious as arbitrary imprisonment or torture."""" Today one-half of Zimbabwe's population of nearly 14 million is considered """"food-insecure,"""" living in households that are unable to obtain enough food to meet basic needs. The international community has spent hundreds of millions of dollars pouring food aid into Zimbabwe, yet thousands continue to go hungry. Any perceived political adversaries of ZANU-PF or the government encounter difficulty gaining access to food. Known members of the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), are top-most among perceived enemies. This category also encompasses teachers, former commercial farm workers and urban residents-groups generally considered to favor the MDC. In effect, without a ZANU-PF party card, a Zimbabwean cannot register for or receive government-subsidized grain. Often international relief agencies need to rely on local authorities in some cases to determine beneficiary status, which leads to a certain degree of political manipulation. However, some international aid programs are also politicized. According to insiders of the international aid regime, some international donors are opposed to funding aid for those resettled on the former commercial farms that were redistributed under the """"fast-track"""" land reform program. The international aid agencies universally deny that donors' political opposition to land reform is a factor, explaining that they cannot distribute any relief food in these areas until a comprehensive needs assessment has been completed by the government. """"Politically, it is disadvantageous for the Zimbabwe government to investigate need on the resettled farms,"""" said Takirambudde. """"If the farms are not productive and people are hungry, the government's land reform program will look like a failure. It seems that the government is manipulating relief efforts, and that the international community is playing along even though people on the resettled farms need food desperately."""" Human Rights Watch asserted that the Zimbabwe government has an obligation under international and domestic law to supply food without reference to race, religion, ethnicity or regional origin, or to residence, sex or political affiliation. The government should instruct authorities in charge of beneficiary lists to abide by the principle of nondiscrimination. The government should impress upon the leadership of all political parties that it is prohibited under domestic and international law for politicians and party supporters to use food to influence or reward constituents or voters. Punitive action should be taken against those who flout this prohibition. Human Rights Watch recommended that the international community continue to fight the politicization of relief food through its efforts to maintain tight controls on food distribution and to implement all aspects of relief efforts directly or through local non-governmental organizations. Human Rights Watch also emphasized that international aid should not be based on any factor other than need. In particular, farmers who were resettled under the """"fast-track"""" land reform program should be eligible to receive food aid from all international sources. Donors that have withdrawn support for humanitarian programs in Zimbabwe should reconsider their duty, under international law, to assist those in need.","Africa, Zimbabwe",""

Zahedi traveled to Iran in June to visit his family. In early July, the 37-year-old professor was attending a meeting at his brother's office in Tehran when it was raided by the authorities. The other attendees were arrested and quickly released, but Zahedi was detained in Tehran's Evin Prison in a section controlled by the Ministry of Intelligence. """"Dariush Zahedi has been held in solitary confinement and is at risk of being tortured,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Iranian government has not provided any evidence of wrongdoing. Professor Zahedi should be freed immediately and allowed to leave the country."""" Zahedi has been accused of espionage, according to Mohsen Armin, a member of the Iranian parliament who met with Ministry of Intelligence officials. Zahedi was also reportedly told that he was under suspicion of organizing student protests because he had been to Iran for several consecutive summers on dates that coincided with the politically charged anniversaries of the 1999 Tehran University protests. After a 40-day investigation by the Ministry of Intelligence into espionage charges, Zahedi was reportedly cleared of suspicion. However, it appears that Tehran Chief Prosecutor Said Mortazavi intervened and transferred Zahedi's case to the judiciary. He has been kept in the judiciary-controlled sector of Evin Prison since, almost entirely in solitary confinement. His family has received no information regarding the legal status of his case. Informal efforts to secure Zahedi's release have failed. His family has known of his detention since the summer, but kept silent because security forces told them that if they publicized the case, he would be harmed. Zahedi's family has visited him briefly in prison twice, and has been able to speak with him only once by phone in the presence of a guard. He does not have a lawyer, and his family has little information about his condition in prison. Human Rights Watch fears that Zahedi may be tortured in order to obtain a videotaped """"confession,"""" a tactic often used against political detainees in Evin Prison. Zahedi has taught at several universities in the United States and has published numerous academic works focusing on Iran and the Middle East. He was scheduled to teach a class this fall at the Peace and Conflict Studies Department at the University of California, Berkeley. University of California officials have also expressed concern for Zahedi's safety. Zahedi's detention is by no means unique. Iranian authorities are holding scores of professors, lawyers, students and activists arrested after expressing their views. Human Rights Watch on October 9 named other political prisoners in a letter to European Union officials who were meeting with Iranian government officials in Brussels on October 8-9.

One in six U.S. prisoners is mentally ill. Many of them suffer from serious illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression. There are three times as many men and women with mental illness in U.S. prisons as in mental health hospitals. The rate of mental illness in the prison population is three times higher than in the general population. According to the 215-page report, Ill-Equipped: U.S. Prisons and Offenders with Mental Illness, prisons are dangerous and damaging places for mentally ill people. Other prisoners victimize and exploit them. Prison staff often punish mentally ill offenders for symptoms of their illness – such as being noisy or refusing orders, or even self-mutilation and attempted suicide. Mentally ill prisoners are more likely than others to end up housed in especially harsh conditions, such as isolation, that can push them over the edge into acute psychosis. “Prisons have become the nation’s primary mental health facilities,” said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch’s U.S. Program and a co-author of the report. “But for those with serious illnesses, prison can be the worst place to be.” Woefully deficient mental health services in many prisons leave prisoners undertreated – or not treated at all. Across the country, prisoners cannot get appropriate care because of a shortage of qualified staff, lack of facilities, and prison rules that interfere with treatment. According to Human Rights Watch, the high rate of incarceration of the mentally ill is a consequence of underfunded, disorganized, and fragmented community mental health services. State and local governments have shut down mental health hospitals across the United States, but failed to provide adequate alternatives. Many people with mental illness – particularly those who are poor, homeless, or struggling with substance abuse problems – cannot get mental health treatment. If they commit a crime, even low-level nonviolent offenses, punitive sentencing laws mandate imprisonment. “Unless you are wealthy, it can be next to impossible to receive mental health services in the community,” said Fellner. “Many prisoners might never have ended up behind bars if publicly funded treatment had been available.” The Human Rights Watch report is based on more than two years of research and hundreds of interviews with prisoners, corrections officials, mental health experts and attorneys. It describes prisoners who, because of their illness, rant and rave, babble incoherently, or huddle silently in their cells. They talk to invisible companions, living in worlds constructed of hallucinations. They lash out without provocation, beat their heads against cell walls, cover themselves with feces, mutilate themselves until their bodies are riddled with scars, and attempt suicide. The Human Rights Watch report documents how prisoners with mental illness are likely to be picked on, physically or sexually abused, and manipulated by other inmates, who call them “bugs.” For example, a prisoner in Georgia, who is both mentally ill and mildly retarded, has been raped repeatedly and exchanges sex for commissary items such as cigarettes and coffee. Mentally ill prisoners can find it difficult if not impossible to comply with prison rules, and end up with higher than average rates of disciplinary infractions. Security staff – who usually lack training in mental illness – do not distinguish between the prisoner who is disruptive or fails to obey an order because of illness and a prisoner who causes problems for other reasons. Mentally ill prisoners have been punished for self-mutilating (“destroying state property”); attempting suicide with a torn sheet (“destroying state property”); for yelling and kicking cell doors because of hearing voices (“creating a disturbance”); for throwing papers at a guard while delusional (“battery”); and for smearing feces on the cell door (“being untidy”). Untrained staff escalate confrontations with mentally ill prisoners, sometimes using excessive force. Several mentally ill prisoners have died from asphyxiation after struggling with guards who used improper methods to control them. Over the past two decades, prison mental health services in the United States have improved – usually because of prisoner litigation. But the surging number of mentally ill men and women entering prison has outrun the availability of services. Public officials have been unwilling to provide the funds necessary to ensure adequate treatment for all the mentally ill offenders who need it. “Prison officials are being asked to do something they aren’t equipped to do,” said Fellner. “Prisons are designed for punishment, not as places to provide comprehensive mental health treatment. If people with mental illness must be incarcerated, they should be housed in facilities designed and funded to meet their mental health needs.” Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. Congress to enact legislation proposed by Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) and Congressman Ted Strickland (D-Ohio) that would provide federal grants to divert mentally ill offenders into treatment programs rather than jail or prison, and to improve the quality of mental health services provided to jail and prison inmates. Human Rights Watch also recommended the use of independent mental health experts to assess mental health services in each prison system, urged elected officials and the heads of correctional agencies to ensure that mentally ill prisoners receive mental health services consistent with community standards of care, and called for rules to prevent housing prisoners with mental illness in isolated confinement or super maximum security prisons.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Disability Rights, Health"

Ilham Aliev, the son of the outgoing leader, was elected president in a vote that international and local observers said was marred by widespread fraud. “The Azerbaijani authorities are using the post-election violence, an affair in which they themselves played a major role, to justify a massive crackdown on the opposition,” said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch’s senior emergencies researcher. “Arbitrary arrests have to stop. Those arrested without cause must be released immediately, and those in custody should have access to an attorney.” Human Rights Watch called on the government to publish a full list of all those arrested in the aftermath of the election, their whereabouts and the charges against them. Human Rights Watch urged the international community to press the Azerbaijani government to launch an independent commission, with international participation, to investigate election fraud. Almost immediately after the polls closed on October 15, violence erupted between opposition supporters and the police. Later that evening, Azerbaijani security forces attacked peaceful opposition supporters gathered outside the headquarters of the main opposition party, Musavat (“Equality”), injuring at least 50 protesters. Most of the arrests have occurred since October 16, when attempts by the security forces to prevent a march organized by the opposition turned violent. For details, please see Human Rights Watch press release “Azerbaijan: Post-Election Clashes Turn Deadly.” Human Rights Watch has been able to confirm at least 190 arrests of opposition leaders and supporters, although the actual number of detainees is much higher. For example, the Minister of Interior stated on October 17 that 190 persons had been detained during the October 16 violence alone. Many of those arrested were beaten while being taken into custody. The charges, if any, against those detained are unknown, as in many cases they have not had access to counsel. Several national leaders of the opposition have been among those arrested, including Sardar Jalaloglu, secretary-general of the Azerbaijan Democratic Party (ADP), taken from his home on October 18 by armed masked men; Igbal Agazadeh, chair of the Umid (“Hope”) Party, arrested on October 17; Panah Huseinov, chair of the Khalq (“Nation”) Party, and a former prime minister of Azerbaijan, arrested on October 19; and Vagif Hajibeili, chair of the Ahrar party, arrested on October 17. Most of the national leaders are being held at the Organized Crime Unit of the Ministry of Interior, a department that routinely uses torture and other physical abuse against detainees, according to Human Rights Watch research. For details, please see Human Rights Watch briefing paper “Azerbaijan: Presidential Elections 2003.” The main opposition leader and presidential contender Isa Gambar, chair of the Musavat party, is under house arrest, and his bodyguards have been detained. Several Musavat deputy chiefs have been arrested, including Sulheddin Akper, deputy chief for international affairs; Ibrahim Ibrahimli, deputy chief for humanitarian affairs; Arif Hajiev, deputy chief for organizational affairs; and Mirbaba Babaev, a member of the Musavat supreme council. The campaign of arrests has also focused on members of the “Our Azerbaijan” bloc, including many civil society leaders, who supported the candidacy of Musavat leader Isa Gambar. Mehti Mehtiev, director of the Human Rights Resource Center, was arrested at his home on October 18. Itimar Asadov, chair of the Karabakh Invalids Association, was arrested on October 17. The security forces also attempted to arrest Ilgar Ibrahimoglu, a major religious leader and the head of the Center for the Protection of Conscience and Religious Freedom; he received refuge in the Norwegian Embassy after two of his associates, Azad Nazimanoglu and Najaf Allahverdiyev, were arrested on October 17. The authorities have also detained local opposition activists in villages and towns throughout Azerbaijan. For example, on October 17, police in the town of Saatli arrested Agarza Miriev, the local Musavat chief; Beibala Akperov, his deputy; Mikhail Humbatov, chair of the local ADP branch; Chingiz Umudov, the local chief of the Liberal Party; and Fakhreddin Abdiev, the local chief of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party (APFP). Among other local leaders whose arrest Human Rights Watch has been able to confirm are: the chairs or deputy chairs of the Musavat party branches of Ali Bairamli, Gazakh, Gabala, Ismaili, and Jalilabad, Sumgait; the head of the ADP branches in Ali Bairamli, Imishli, and Zagatla; the chairs of the Azerbaijani National Independence Party (ANIP) branches in Ganja, Quba, and Shamkir; and the chairs of the APFP branches in Jalilabad and Siazan. Human Rights Watch also confirmed the arrest of the head of the Umid party in Ali Bairamli. All of their names are on file with Human Rights Watch. In addition, the Azerbaijani authorities have arrested dozens of opposition members who served as observers and polling-station officials during the October 15 election because they refused to sign vote tallies from their polling stations that they believed were fraudulent. The tallies, known as protocols, require the signatures of polling-station officials. In the town of Ganja alone, Human Rights Watch has obtained the names of 32 opposition polling-station officials who are currently being detained for their refusal to sign fraudulent vote tallies. International monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe and the National Institute for Democracy (NDI) have confirmed widespread fraud on election day. According to many reports, the families of opposition election officials who refused to sign forged protocols have also come under pressure and been victims of intimidation from government officials, and in some cases have themselves been arrested. Human Rights Watch calls on the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately end the crackdown against members of the opposition. Human Rights Watch further urged the Azerbaijani government to carry out a prompt, independent and impartial investigation into the violence plaguing the country prior and subsequent to the election, and to investigate and prosecute security officials and others implicated in abuses. Urgent international action is needed to prevent a further decline in human rights conditions in Azerbaijan, Human Rights Watch stressed. Human Rights Watch also urges the Council of Europe and the OSCE, together with the United States and the European Union, to press the Azerbaijani government to form an independent commission to investigate election fraud. Election experts from the Council of Europe and OSCE should be part of this commission. “Azerbaijan is going through its most serious human rights crisis of the past decade,” said Bouckaert. “If this crackdown continues, there won’t be an opposition left in Azerbaijan by the end of the month.”","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

In a memorandum to donor governments and agencies, Human Rights Watch stressed that reconstruction efforts would only succeed if they addressed longstanding human rights problems in Iraq and strengthened human rights protection for the future. """"The needs assessment presented to donors this week recognizes the importance of human rights, but it fails to address many critical issues and does not allocate the resources that will be required to solve them,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch called on donors to support the creation in Iraq of a national human rights commission to review laws and investigate complaints, and an independent mechanism to prevent abuses by police and the courts. Donors should also help foster the capacity of local nongovernmental organizations to address human rights issues. As the development of local human rights monitors would take time, the United Nations should expand its monitoring role in the interim. Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations to prepare for an expanded human rights operation in Iraq and deploy monitors as security conditions permit. """"Donors should not assist with training police and security forces in Iraq without monitoring their conduct in conformity with international policing and human rights standards,"""" Mungoven said. Human Rights Watch said significant resources would be needed to ensure accountability for past human rights abuses beyond the small provision made in the needs assessment. Help would be needed with investigations and witness protection, and for support to victims and their relatives. """"Donors will only be successful in reconstructing the rule of law in Iraq if they also address the serious abuses of the past,"""" said Mungoven. """"But justice cannot be done on the cheap, nor should donors support a flawed justice process."""" Human Rights Watch warned that an Iraqi-led accountability process as supported by the United States would likely fail to ensure justice, because the Iraqi judiciary lacks the capacity and expertise for trials of this kind. Instead, donors should commission a group of international and Iraqi experts to make a proper assessment and recommend the best justice model. The United Nations and World Bank have also identified property restitution for refugees and internally displaced persons as a critical issue. Human Rights Watch urged donors to help provide shelter to families in immediate need and to establish a special mechanism to settle longer-term property disputes. Other countries should not require refugees to return to Iraq, however, until security conditions permit. Human Rights Watch said the needs assessment presented to donors paid insufficient attention to the specific needs of children in post-war Iraq. Special efforts are needed to reach vulnerable groups such as street children and to combat trafficking and hazardous child labor. Human Rights Watch also urged donors to help build the capacity of Iraq's law enforcement and judicial sector to address sexual violence against women and girls.

The 56-page report, Hearts and Minds: Post-War Civilian Casualties in Baghdad by U.S. Forces, confirms twenty deaths in the Iraqi capital alone between May 1 and September 30. In total, Human Rights Watch collected credible reports of 94 civilian deaths in Baghdad, involving questionable legal circumstances that warrant investigation. This number does not include civilians wounded by U.S. troops. The precise number of Iraqi civilians killed by U.S. soldiers since the end of major military operations is unknown, and the U.S. military told Human Rights Watch that it keeps no statistics on civilian deaths.     October 20, 2003  Hearts and Minds   Post-War Civilian Casualties in Baghdad by U.S. Forces            Download this report       “It’s a tragedy that U.S. soldiers have killed so many civilians in Baghdad,” said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “But it’s really incredible that the U.S. military does not even count these deaths. Any time U.S. forces kill an Iraqi civilian in questionable circumstances, they should investigate the incident.” Thus far, the military says it has concluded only five investigations above the division level, ordered by the deputy commanding general, into alleged unlawful deaths. Of these, soldiers were found to have operated “within the rules of engagement” in four cases. In the fifth case, a helicopter pilot and his commander face disciplinary action for trying to tear down a Shi`a banner in Sadr City in Baghdad, an incident that provoked a violent clash with demonstrators on August 13. Human Rights Watch conducted its own investigation of two of these five cases, and found evidence to suggest that soldiers had used excessive force, including shooting a person who had his hands in the air and beating a detainee. In some cases, U.S. forces faced a real threat, which gave them the right to respond with force. But that response was sometimes disproportionate or indiscriminate, harming civilians or putting them at risk. “The cases we documented in this report reveal a pattern of over-aggressive tactics, excessive shooting in residential areas and hasty reliance on lethal force,” Stork said. In compiling its report, Human Rights Watch conducted more than 60 interviews and gathered information from five sources: Iraqi witnesses and family members of victims, police records from all the police stations in Baghdad, local and international human rights groups, media accounts, and the U.S. military. The Human Rights Watch report categorizes civilian deaths in Baghdad since May 1 in three basic groups: during raids, at checkpoints, and after ambushes on convoys. In all three circumstances, soldiers often quickly resorted to the use of lethal force. Their fire was not always directed at the intended target, or proportionate to the threat. “Iraq is clearly a hostile environment for U.S. troops,” said Stork. “But that does not absolve the military from its legal obligations to use force in a restrained and proportionate manner – and only when necessary.” Part of the problem is the deployment of combat troops, such as the 82nd Airborne Division and the 1st Armored Division, for essentially law enforcement tasks. Many of these soldiers fought their way into Iraq and were then asked to switch from acting as warriors to serving as policemen who must control crowds, pursue thieves and root out insurgents. For these policing tasks they are not properly trained, equipped or psychologically prepared. In some cases, U.S. soldiers have behaved with unnecessary rudeness toward Iraqi civilians. Human Rights Watch strongly recommended that U.S. forces desist from the practice of putting their feet on the heads of Iraqis whom they have detained face-down on the ground. In Iraqi culture, the use of feet against another person is highly insulting and offensive. U.S. military officials told Human Rights Watch they were providing extra training for U.S. forces. Human Rights Watch researchers met many U.S. military personnel who dealt respectfully with Iraqis and were working hard to train Iraqi police, guard facilities and pursue criminals. Some of these soldiers expressed frustration at the behavior of their colleagues. “It takes a while to get the Rambo stuff out,” one officer told Human Rights Watch. In the meantime, the lack of timely and high-level investigations into many questionable incidents has created an atmosphere of impunity. “Soldiers must know they will be held accountable for the improper use of force,” Stork said. “Right now, soldiers feel they can pull the trigger without coming under review.” The Human Rights Watch report proposed concrete ways to reduce civilian deaths in Iraq. Checkpoints should be better marked with signs in Arabic and lights, and interpreters should accompany all raids. The military’s rules of engagement are not made public due to security concerns, but Iraqi civilians have a right to know how they are expected to behave at checkpoints and during raids. Coalition forces should make such information available through the local media, Human Rights Watch urged. Most importantly, U.S. military authorities should investigate all credible allegations of unlawful killings by coalition soldiers, and punish soldiers and commanders found to have used or tolerated the use of excessive or indiscriminate force.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, United States",""

It was dark, and he couldn't see the American soldiers from the 1st Armored Division operating a checkpoint with armored vehicles and heavy-caliber guns. No signs or lights were visible, and he did not understand that he was supposed to stop. So he drove a bit too close and the soldiers opened fire, killing him along with three of his children, the youngest of whom was 8 years old. Such accidents are no longer rare in Iraq. They occur at checkpoints, during raids or after roadside attacks as edgy U.S. soldiers resort with distressing speed to lethal force. Even when they have good reason to shoot, soldiers sometimes respond in an excessive and indiscriminate way that puts civilians unnecessarily at risk. The U.S. military does not keep statistics on the civilian deaths it has caused, saying it is """"impossible for us to maintain an accurate account."""" But in two weeks of research last month, Human Rights Watch confirmed the deaths of 20 Iraqi civilians in Baghdad at the hands of American troops since the end of major combat operations in May. In total, we collected reports of 94 civilian deaths in Baghdad involving questionable legal circumstances that warrant investigation. U.S. soldiers are hot, tired and homesick. They face attacks every day from an increasingly organized resistance that melds into the local population and does not care about civilians. But that doesn't mean that coalition forces should be allowed to operate with near total impunity, as they currently are. They are exempt from Iraqi law, and the military is not adequately investigating allegations of abuse. Thus far, the military has publicly announced only five completed investigations into civilian deaths in Iraq. In each case, the soldiers who fired were found to have operated within the rules of engagement. I re-investigated two of the five incidents and found evidence to suggest the contrary -- that, in fact, excessive force had been used. In one, which occurred Aug. 9, soldiers from the 1st Armored Division mistakenly shot at an unmarked Iraqi police car as it chased criminals in a van. The Americans killed two Iraqi police officers. A witness said one of the officers was killed after he had stepped out of his car with his hands raised, shouting """"No -- police!"""" A third police officer in the car was beaten by the Americans. The second case was the shooting of the Kawwaz family on Aug. 7, which the military called """"a regrettable incident"""" but ultimately determined had been within the rules of engagement. Our research, however, revealed that the troops used overwhelming firepower on a family without first firing warning shots. The U.S. military gave the Kawwaz family $11,000 """"as an expression of sympathy."""" There are numerous other complaints against U.S. troops these days, including many that do not involve civilian deaths. When I waited in Baghdad three weeks ago to see a legal officer from the 82nd Airborne Division at his base, two Iraqi lawyers were with me at the gate, both with armloads of complaints against U.S. soldiers. The legal officer told me that his brigade alone had received more than 700 complaints against U.S. troops, ranging from property damage to car accidents to beatings to killings. The military's public affairs office later told me it had paid out $901,545 in compensation for a variety of offenses committed by American troops. But this is not about money. The excessive behavior of American soldiers is creating animosity at least, and possibly even new recruits for the resistance. Not only individuals but whole tribes are swearing revenge, according to the interviews we conducted. Part of the problem is the reliance on combat troops to perform post-conflict policing tasks for which they are not prepared. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne or the 1st Armored Division are trained to fight wars -- not to control crowds, pursue thieves or root out insurgents. Some military officials recognize the problem and have ordered extra training for combat troops. But as of now, the danger still exists. I met many Iraqis during my visit who were hopeful the U.S. would help build a democratic Iraq. But many were dismayed by the cultural insensitivity and aggression of some U.S. troops that were alienating Iraqis day by day. """"I wish Saddam would return and kill all Americans,"""" Adil abd al Karim al Kawwaz's distraught wife, Anwar, told a journalist a few days after the U.S. soldiers had killed her husband and three of their children. Her view is not shared by many, but the number is growing with each civilian killed.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, United States",""

In the former Soviet bloc's first dynastic succession, Ilham Aliyev, son of the ailing Communist-era holdover Heydar Aliyev, has now become president. Many in Western policy circles viewed this transition as critical to the stability of billions of dollars of investments in the country's energy sector. The violent events of the past few days should make them think otherwise. International and domestic monitors reported widespread irregularities in the Oct. 15 election. I saw it myself at a polling station where the election chief kicked out local observers and made off with the votes, claiming she had to take a nap. The government clearly stole the election, and then brutally beat hundreds of people who poured out in the streets in protest. The day after the election, I watched from the roof of a hotel in Baku as thousands of riot police beat protesters unconscious. Afterward the riot police raised their shields to the sky and turned their batons into drumsticks, celebrating the victory of intimidation. Now hundreds have been arrested, while Isa Gambar, the opposition leader, is effectively under house arrest and activists from his Musavat party are being beaten and detained all over the country. Everyone I speak to is scared. The violence surrounding the election was shocking yet predictable, as the government for years has shut the opposition out of the political process. In the months leading up to the poll, Azerbaijani authorities blatantly manipulated the electoral process to ensure that Ilham Aliyev would inherit his father's presidency. The opposition had nowhere to go but the streets. More astonishing, however, were the public assessments of the election made by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe. Their election-monitoring missions in Azerbaijan took due note of the violence and election irregularities, but their overall appraisals were alarmingly upbeat. The OSCE mission chief, Giovanni Kessler, said the election showed """"an increased vitality of political life and serious efforts in Azerbaijan towards democracy and international standards.” Meanwhile, the head of the Council of Europe's parliamentary delegation, Guillermo Martínez Casañ, said he hoped the election could """"mark the beginning of a new era in Azerbaijan in which progress could be achieved through cooperation of all democratic forces in the country."""" The Aliyev government has a terrible human rights record, and a long history of imprisoning its opponents, rigging elections and breaking up public protests with excessive violence. International and local observers have charged that the country's last national election, the parliamentary election of 2000, was blatantly fraudulent. The international community is well aware of this sorry history, but it seems to want to wish it away so it can get on with business with the oil-rich country's government. Europe's foremost human rights body, the Council of Europe, admitted Azerbaijan in 2000 despite the country's disastrous parliamentary election. The Council of Europe did establish a body that monitors the country's democratic development and requires the government to report back on charges of election fraud. But this measure did little to restrain the government from repeating election fraud last week. This time, the international community must not passively accept a violently stolen election. Azerbaijanis are justifiably tired of the corruption and arbitrariness of years of rule under the current government. They are growing increasingly suspicious of the West and its unwillingness to be tough on the Aliyev clan. Moreover, letting the Azerbaijani government steal its election will embolden other governments to do the same. In the long run, this will contribute to more public discontent and destabilize this oil-rich region.

Burma's pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, was arrested on May 30 following a deadly attack by Burmese security forces on a convoy of National League of Democracy (NLD) supporters. In the wake of Suu Kyi's arrest, Burma's military government, known as the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), has been under pressure from the United Nations, the United States and the European Union to release the Nobel Peace laureate and to engage in genuine political negotiations with the political opposition. But this pressure has been undermined by continued support for the SPDC from China and Thailand and other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries. """"Continued economic and political support from some ASEAN members and China has undermined attempts to send a clear message to Burma's military rulers that it is time for them to make way for an elected civilian government,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"The APEC meeting is the perfect opportunity for the international community to take a united stand against a government that systematically abuses human rights, provokes refugee flows to neighboring countries, and destabilizes the region."""" Human Rights Watch noted that Malaysia and Indonesia, although closely allied to the SPDC, have called for the release of Suu Kyi, who remains under house arrest after months in detention. Last week the United Nations special envoy to Burma, Razali Ismail, was rebuffed when he demanded her release. """"While the Burmese military government claims that it has a 'roadmap' to democracy, there is no evidence that any such plan exists or that it has any intentions of engaging in good faith negotiations with the political opposition,"""" said Adams. """"Thailand and others in ASEAN should no longer accept the fiction that such a 'roadmap' exists and should insist that Burma's military leaders sit down with the opposition and the ethnic minority parties and hash out a plan for a return to an elected, civilian government."""" While public demands from ASEAN countries for Suu Kyi's release are welcome, Human Rights Watch said that a more significant step would be for countries with close relations with the SPDC-such as China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia-to halt the economic and political support that allows the SPDC to continue in power. Limitations on trade and investment with Burma by the United States and limitations on aid by the United States, Japan, and the European Union are being seriously undermined by continued private international investment and military aid from other countries, particularly China. Human Rights Watch urged Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra of Thailand, which is hosting the APEC meeting, to relax the Thai government's recent crackdown on Burmese refugees and migrants in Thailand and to drop plans to repatriate Burmese citizens into the hands of the SPDC. A disproportionate number of Burmese in Thailand are members of Burma's ethnic minority groups. """"So long as Burma's military government continues to use violence, forced displacement and forced labor, people fleeing Burma will have nowhere to go but Thailand,"""" said Adams. """"Mr. Thaksin should be told that forced repatriation to Burma in these circumstances is a violation of international law and will not be tolerated. The participation of the ethnic minority groups is essential to a political settlement in Burma, but Thailand seems determined to close the political space of Burmese in Thailand in order to bolster its relations with Burma's military government."""" Human Rights Watch urged donors to step up support for Thai human rights nongovernmental organizations and those organizations offering support for Burmese refugees and migrants, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Though APEC is primarily an economic forum, it has put the issue of terrorism at the heart of its agenda for the past two years. Human Rights Watch urged APEC to take human rights just as seriously, particularly when it is meeting next door to one of the world's most abusive regimes. Such issues have been addressed at APEC before, notably with reference to the situation in East Timor in 1999. """"The situation in Burma has reached such a critical stage that APEC's leaders cannot ignore it,"""" said Adams. """"If they offer the excuse that their meetings are about economics and not about human rights, they will send the message to Burma that they are not serious about the need for change. It is rare that all the key players on Burma are at the same table. This in an opportunity that should not be missed.""""","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

That was hardly the environment the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) envisioned when it decided to hold its 2003 meeting in Bangkok.  While the leaders at next week's APEC meeting will be treated to the traditional splendor of Thai culture, including a grand flotilla of royal barges on the Chao Phraya River, they won't see, as one human-rights worker put it, """"stray dogs, homeless people, or human-rights activists."""" That's because Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has ordered a Potemkin welcome for APEC, in which the streets are scrubbed, new trees planted, and tens of thousands of homeless people and prostitutes run out of town. A number of undocumented Cambodians, mostly beggars, have even been flown back to Phnom Penh. The Thai government has also banned some 500 human-rights and social activists from entering the country and threatened potential organizers of protests. Mr. Thaksin seems intent on making sure the clang of different voices that has been the hallmark of a remarkably successful civil society over the past decade -- and which has helped make Thailand so refreshing in a region not noted for tolerance of free expression -- disappears while APEC is in town. Many members of Thai civil society are worried that a temporary hiatus will turn into a permanent slumber. Most worrying is the return of terms such as """"extrajudicial execution"""" to the Thai political vocabulary. Since February, when Mr. Thaksin responded to the widespread and growing problem of methamphetamine trafficking and use by declaring a """"war on drugs,"""" Thai police report that approximately 3,000 alleged drug criminals have been killed. The government says that only about 100 were killed by police, in self-defense, and the rest in internal turf wars among dealers. Tens of thousands have been arrested. Many of those who have looked into these deaths have alleged the involvement of state security officials. Instead of conducting investigations or urging restraint in the midst of such carnage, Mr. Thaksin, a former police officer, has called for law enforcement to be conducted on the basis of """"an eye for an eye."""" Early on Mr. Thaksin disclaimed official responsibility for the large number of deaths, saying, """"In this war, drug dealers must die. But we don't kill them. It's a matter of bad guys killing bad guys."""" However, few in Thailand find this explanation credible, particularly after his subsequent statement in August that Thai security forces """"would shoot to kill"""" when they encountered Burmese drug traffickers, """"Their drugs have gradually killed our children, so we won't spare them."""" Interior Minister Wan Muhamad Nor Matha put the lack of concern for due process just as bluntly, saying, """"They will be put behind bars or even vanish without a trace. Who cares? They are destroying our country."""" While the government claims that its war on drugs has been successful and the drug problem in Thailand has largely been wiped out, it has now turned to a new war on a more nebulous group of """"dark forces."""" Targeted groups include mafia kingpins and corrupt officials. Many fear another bloodbath is brewing. Mr. Thaksin has shown his contempt for human rights by offering political support for Burma's military government and its bogus """"roadmap"""" to political normalization. He has also taken steps to crack down on Burmese refugees and migrants in Thailand. Most were driven into Thailand by the brutal policies of Burma's ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). Yet Thailand is considering forcibly deporting tens of thousands back into the hands of the SPDC without any assurances for the respect of human rights. This is extremely worrisome, given the atrocious human-rights record of the SPDC and the well-documented persecution of the largely ethnic-minority population that is at greatest risk of repatriation. A climate of fear and self-censorship now shadows Thai and foreign nongovernmental organizations and activists, particularly those working near the Burmese border. They have been intimidated, harassed and pressured not to engage in activities that might interfere with the Thai government's plans or to criticize neighboring governments, such as the SPDC. While Mr. Thaksin campaigned for political office as a modernizer, his tactics represent a step back to the dark days of military rule in Thailand. Though APEC is primarily an economic forum, it took on the issue of international terrorism last year. This year, meeting in a country in a human-rights crisis, APEC's leaders, including U.S. President George W. Bush, Australian Prime Minister John Howard, and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, must take up human-rights issues when they meet their host. They should demand an end to the use of state-sponsored violence and an independent investigation of all killings related to Thailand's war on drugs and dark forces. To ensure credibility, Asma Jahangir, the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, should be invited to investigate. Donors should step up support for Thai human-rights NGOs and those offering support for Burmese refugees and migrants, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. So long as the SPDC continues to embrace the tactics of violence (including sexual violence), forced displacement, and forced labor, they truly will have nowhere else to go. Mr. Thaksin should be told that forced repatriation to Burma in these circumstances is a violation of international law and will not be tolerated. He should also be pressed to lean on the SPDC with the full weight of Thai economic and political influence in order to obtain the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners, and to encourage the SPDC to engage in genuine political negotiations with the opposition. If APEC's leaders offer the excuse that their meetings are about economics and not about human rights, they will effectively give the green light to Mr. Thaksin. They will also show APEC to be irrelevant to the basic needs of its citizens. This would violate one of APEC's own goals, which is """"Making APEC Matter More.""""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/16/azerbaijan-post-election-clashes-turn-deadly","Azerbaijan- Post-Election Clashes Turn Deadly","Azerbaijan: Post-Election Clashes Turn Deadly","Security Forces Use Excessive Force on Protesters","10/16/2003","Violent clashes between security forces and opposition protesters in Azerbaijan have left at least one civilian dead and hundreds wounded just one day after presidential elections, Human Rights Watch said today. Human Rights Watch criticized the Azerbaijani government for using excessive police violence against the protesters. “The Azerbaijani security forces have crushed post-election opposition protests by beating and severely injuring countless civilians,” stated Peter Bouckaert, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, who witnessed the violence in Baku and interviewed more than a dozen of those injured by police beatings. “The violence could have been avoided, had the Azerbaijani authorities given political space to the opposition. But instead, for months the government consistently failed to allow peaceful political protest.” Thousands of opposition protesters took to the streets of Baku, the capital, at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. The demonstration quickly grew violent, in part because once the protesters began to congregate, police and military forces immediately surrounded them. The protesters drove away members of the security forces there and marched to Baku’s Azadliq (Freedom) Square. During their march, protesters severely beat some police officers and soldiers, who remain hospitalized. The protesters also destroyed a number of police and military vehicles, and damaged government buildings along the way. Soon after the opposition protesters arrived at Azadliq Square, several thousand riot police and military troops surrounded the entire plaza. Riot police and military stormed the opposition protest, using tear gas, rubber bullets, police dogs and truncheons. From the roof of a nearby building, a Human Rights Watch researcher saw police and military troops chase down protesters, surround them and viciously beat them. Many of the protesters continued to be beaten after they had fallen to the ground. Human Rights Watch observed a number of civilian pro-governmental supporters participating in the beatings with the security forces. Police beat to death at least one person, Hamidagha Zakhidov, 52, whose body Human Rights Watch viewed after the protests. His body was completely black and blue, and his head smashed and bloody. Zakhidov had come to Azadliq Square that morning from the city of Saatli to “protect his rights,” according to his brother. Another of Zakhidov’s brothers was also badly beaten, but a clinic refused to treat him. Human Rights Watch is investigating numerous but unconfirmed reports of additional deaths. Footage shot by international television crews showing security forces gathering and removing several inert bodies from the square appears to indicate additional fatalities. Human Rights Watch called upon the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately release information about the number of persons killed during the violent clashes. So far, an estimated 300 persons have sustained serious injuries during the clashes, according to local hospital officials and other sources. Many of the wounded were unable to walk and had to be carried away from the square. Human Rights Watch has conducted interviews with more than a dozen of the wounded, all of who describe being surrounded by groups of riot police and military troops who beat them severely, leaving many unconscious. Police also attacked and severely beat local members of the press, even after they identified themselves as journalists. Also among the injured are several dozen police and army personnel. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials states that law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall as far as possible apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force. Whenever the lawful use of force is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall use restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offense. The legitimate objective should be achieved with minimal damage and injury, and preservation of human life respected. “The consistent pattern of wanton violence against the political opposition suggests that the government has given the security forces free rein to use excessive force,” Bouckaert said. “The government must fully investigate this and previous incidents, determine the chain-of-command, and prosecute those responsible for excessive use of force. The culture of impunity for such attacks must end.” Clashes continued this evening in Baku, with heavy concentrations of riot police and military troops deployed throughout the city. The security forces continue to beat anyone suspected to be part of the opposition. Some of the victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch in the hospital were entirely unconnected to the opposition. Asif Aliskerov, 28, was shopping for shoes in the center of Baku when he was beaten unconscious by a group of about 50 members of the security forces. The violent clashes today followed Wednesday’s presidential elections, which took place in a climate of constant intimidation and government-sponsored violence against the opposition. Last night, government forces repeatedly and violently attacked the headquarters of the main opposition party, Musavat, severely beating at least 50 opposition members. For details, please see Human Rights Watch press release “Azerbaijan: Police Attack Protesters on Election Day”. The opposition supporters were shouting pro-opposition slogans outside the Musavat headquarters when they were attacked. The Musavat headquarters had been surrounded, leaving hundreds blocked inside. After additional clashes during the night, people were finally able to leave the building. Human Rights Watch regrets the use of violence by members of the opposition, and has repeatedly met with opposition leaders in the past days to urge non-violent protests. Without condoning the use of violence by the opposition, Human Rights Watch stressed that the violence could have been avoided, had the government allowed a wider margin of political freedom for the opposition in the lead-up to the election and on the election day.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

The decision by a criminal court in Algiers came in a retrial of Sidhoum’s earlier conviction in absentia, which had resulted in a sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. “We are delighted that Salaheddine Sidhoum is now able to return to a life in freedom and hope that this is a positive sign for human rights defenders in Algeria who must be able to carry out their work without interference or harassment,” said June Ray, director of Amnesty International’s Middle East and North Africa Program. Sidhoum, a physician and human rights activist, lived in hiding since 1994 following threats against him allegedly by both the security forces and armed groups. Wishing to clear his name and return to a normal life, he presented himself to the public prosecutor in Algiers on September 29 and was remanded in custody to await a retrial on the charges previously brought against him. He spent 10 days in Serkadji Prison in Algiers, most of the time on hunger strike, until he left the court yesterday a free man. Sidhoum’s conviction in absentia was handed down in 1997 while he was still in hiding. He had been accused of undermining the state, among other charges related to “acts of terrorism or subversion.” The trial took place at a time when Algeria's courts routinely and massively violated the right of defendants to a fair trial, especially those charged with security offenses. At the retrial, defense lawyers asserted that the court file contained only vague charges against Sidhoum but did not connect him to any specific deeds. The file contained incriminating statements by others, but these were unpersuasive, according to defense lawyers. The prosecutor argued yesterday that, if Sidhoum had been in hiding all these years, he must have been with an armed group. He asked the court to impose a seven-year prison sentence on Sidhoum. The court deliberated for only about one hour before finding Sidhoum innocent on all charges. The court is expected to issue a written decision in the case at a later date. The trial was attended by journalists and international observers, including Tunisian lawyer Samir Ben Amor, who represented Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. However, police and security officers cordoned off the area around the courtroom and prevented access to members of the public, according to Ben Amor. Human rights organizations have repeatedly expressed concerns about restrictions imposed by the Algerian government on human rights defenders in their efforts to document and raise awareness about ongoing killings and torture, and the legacy of the past. “Algeria faces an overwhelming problem of impunity for the most serious human rights violations committed over the past decade,” said Joe Stork, acting director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. “Tens of thousands of killings and thousands of ‘disappearances’ remain uninvestigated to this day. The Algerian authorities should do all they can to ensure that those working to protect human rights will not be subjected to arbitrary restrictions, harassment or intimidation.” Background Since the late 1980s, Sidhoum has been documenting human rights violations and disseminating reports filled with details of incidents of torture, summary executions and """"disappearances"""" attributed to the security forces and their allies. This work, which continued even while he was living clandestinely, helped to alert the international community to human rights conditions in Algeria. He also published a chronology of killings committed over the past decade, including killings of civilians committed by armed groups. Sidhoum went into hiding in December 1994, not long after he gave an interview to a BBC documentary filmmaker in which he denounced torture and summary executions attributed to the security forces. On December 18, 1994—the day after the documentary, “Algeria's Hidden War,” aired on French television—three armed men in plainclothes who were believed to be security officers, came to Sidhoum’s home in Algiers and demanded to see him. Upon being told that he was not home, they threatened his 80-year-old aunt to reveal his whereabouts, and then left. Sidhoum's fears for his personal safety had already been aroused by an article in the September 22, 1994, edition of the Algerian daily newspaper El-Watan that alleged that he belonged to a network of doctors providing medical care to wounded militants. Some of the physicians mentioned in the article had already been placed in detention. One of them was allegedly tortured, partly to extract a “confession” that Sidhoum was an Islamist supporter. That article appeared only two weeks after Sidhoum had sent an open letter to Algerian President Lamine Zeroual that provided details on 53 cases of alleged torture or summary executions. Under international standards—including the United Nations Declaration on the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms—the Algerian authorities have an obligation to ensure that human rights defenders are able to enjoy all their rights and freedoms in practice and to carry out their work without harassment or intimidation.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria",""

In a ruling issued yesterday, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida held Armando Fernández Larios liable for the torture and killing of Winston Cabello, a Chilean economist. The crime was committed in Copiapó, Chile, one month after the September 1973 military coup that brought to power Gen. Augusto Pinochet and extinguished democracy in Chile for 17 years. """"This is a heartening verdict that will make former torturers think twice before coming to the United States to escape justice,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. Cabello, whose relatives live in the United States, was one of 13 political prisoners in Copiapó taken out of jail, tortured and murdered by members of an army task force on October 17, 1973. Other members of the squad, known as the """"Caravan of Death,"""" are on trial in Chile. The task force was formed on the written orders of Pinochet, who was charged in 2001 with covering up the crimes, but was excused from trial in Chile on grounds of mental health. The civil action against Fernández was brought under the Aliens Tort Claims Act (ATCA) of 1789 and the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991, which allow foreign victims of serious human rights abuses committed abroad to sue the perpetrators in U.S. courts. Since the landmark Filartiga case of 1979, dozens of cases have been brought under the ATCA. Under Attorney General John Ashcroft, however, the U.S. Department of Justice has recently challenged its use in human rights cases. """"If ever there was a case to show the value of the ATCA, this is it,"""" said Vivanco. Fernández came to the United States in 1987 after reaching a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in which he pleaded guilty to covering up the 1976 assassination in Washington, D.C., of former Chilean foreign minister Orlando Letelier and his assistant, U.S. citizen Ronni Moffitt. Under the agreement, the U.S. justice authorities undertook not to extradite him to Chile. After serving a five-month prison term, Fernández moved to Miami as a free man. An Argentine court is currently seeking the extradition of Fernández from the United States to try him for his alleged role in the September 1974 assassination in Buenos Aires of former Chilean army commander Gen. Carlos Prats, and his wife Sofía Cuthbert. The extradition request, filed by Argentina in December 2002, is currently under review by the U.S. Department of Justice. """"Now that a U.S. court has found Fernández liable for torture and murder, the Justice Department should turn the extradition request over to a court so that he can be extradited and finally brought to justice in Argentina,"""" said Vivanco. Fernández, who served as a member of Pinochet's secret police, the DINA, has been implicated in numerous other human rights crimes.","Americas, United States, Chile","International Justice"

At least three-dozen wounded have been trapped inside the headquarters of Musavat, one of Azerbaijan’s leading opposition parties. Demonstrators outside the Musavat headquarters in the capital, Baku, had been peacefully protesting the presidential election, which has widely been considered as fraudulent. At around 1:00 a.m. police and security forces confronted the demonstrators and beat them viciously. According to international observers who had witnessed the demonstration, the attack was utterly unprovoked. By 3:00 a.m., Musavat’s headquarters was still surrounded by police and security forces, which attacked some of those who attempted to leave the building. “This is an appalling and unprovoked attack,” said Peter Bouckaert, Human Rights Watch’s senior emergencies researcher. “The Azerbaijani government must allow people to leave the Musavat building now. It is critical that the wounded receive immediate medical attention.” The attack follows a pre-election period during which the government manipulated election procedures and violently repressed the political opposition. Human Rights Watch and local organizations have documented dozens of cases in which Azerbaijani police beat opposition demonstrators in the lead-up to the elections. For details, please see Human Rights Watch briefing paper Azerbaijan: Presidential Elections 2003. “Azerbaijani police are notorious for violently suppressing protesters,” said Bouckaert, who was in the Musavat building just after the attack took place. “But this is the worst case we have seen during the election process.” Human Rights Watch fears further election-related violence in the coming days. Human Rights Watch calls on the Azerbaijani government to cease further attacks on peaceful demonstrators, and urges the international community to press the Azerbaijani authorities to ensure that further violence is avoided and that those responsible are prosecuted.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

The briefing paper, “Aceh Under Martial Law: Can These Men Be Trusted to Prosecute This War?” focuses on four current and two former Indonesian military officers reportedly involved in the current war in Aceh. All have committed serious human rights violations in Indonesia or, during the abusive Indonesian military campaign in 1999, in East Timor. “The deployment of known human rights violators in the military operation in Aceh shows that Indonesia is not serious in its claim that it is cleaning up its armed forces,” said Saman Zia-Zarifi, deputy director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “If Indonesia wants to demonstrate that its military is no longer a brutal force, it should make sure that troops fighting in Aceh follow the rules of war and are disciplined if they fail to abide by them.” Human Rights Watch specifically called for the removal from Aceh of: Major General Adam Damiri – currently Operational Assistant to the Armed Forces Chief of Staff; convicted of crimes against humanity in East Timor by Jakarta’s ad hoc court on East Timor and sentenced to three years in prison. Brigadier General Suhartono Suratman – currently Deputy Armed Forces Spokesman; indicted by the U.N.-created Serious Crimes Unit in East Timor for crimes against humanity committed in East Timor in 1999. Major General Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin – currently Armed Forces Spokesman. Implicated in the crackdown against the May 1998 demonstrations in Jakarta; closely linked to gross human rights violations in East Timor in 1999. Major General Kiki Syahnakri – officially retired, but advising the Indonesian armed forces on the martial law administration for Aceh; indicted by the U.N. Serious Crimes Unit in East Timor for crimes against humanity committed in East Timor in 1999. Colonel Gerhan Lentara – currently Commander of Teungku Umar Korem, Banda Aceh; Martial Law Commander of Dili region of East Timor during a period when 250,000 East Timorese were forcibly expelled from East Timor to Indonesia in September 1999. Lieutenant Colonel Sujono - current position and whereabouts unknown, but has been sighted in Aceh; charged with participation in the Bantaqiah massacre of religious teacher Tengku Bantaqiah and 53 of his students in West Aceh on July 23, 1999; disappeared from police custody prior to his trial.  Human Rights Watch welcomed Indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri’s recent statements on Aceh to the Armed Forces reminding soldiers to execute their duties “as well as possible, in a measured way, and not in an excessive way.” Human Rights Watch called on President Megawati and General Endriartono Sutarto, commander of the Indonesian armed forces, to match this rhetoric and remove abusive troops from the campaign in Aceh and subject them to appropriate criminal or administrative sanctions. “Reform of the military must include accountability within the armed forces,” said Zia-Zarifi. “Indonesia must place the military squarely under civilian control.” Human Rights Watch also urged the international community, particularly the “Quartet,” a diplomatic group composed of the United States, the European Union, Japan and the World Bank, that was previously involved in negotiations to maintain the peace in Aceh, to urge that these officers be immediately removed from involvement in Aceh. Human Rights Watch also called on the international community to cease providing military assistance to the Indonesian armed forces, based on the past record of abuse by the military and the current deployment of known abusers in the campaign in Aceh. The current Indonesian military offensive in Aceh began on May 19 after a six-month ceasefire failed to resolve the longstanding conflict in the province. The Aceh offensive is Indonesia’s largest military campaign since the country’s invasion of East Timor in 1975. Since the start of the military operation, the Indonesian government has severely limited the flow of information from Aceh. The government has interfered with the ability of local journalists to cover the war. It has denied access to Aceh to almost all diplomats, independent international observers, and international human rights organizations. It has also severely restricted access to United Nations and non-governmental humanitarian agencies and the foreign media.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Human Rights Watch also urged the Bolivian government to carry out an immediate investigation into the circumstances, in which some 50 civilians were killed during rioting on Sunday and Monday in El Alto and the capital, La Paz. “With violence escalating, Bolivia is at the brink of catastrophe,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “To avoid further tragic consequences, the government must order the army to act with restraint and must carry out a thorough and impartial investigation into the deaths of the last few days.” Twenty-five civilians and an army conscript were killed on October 12 in El Alto, a poor industrial city outside La Paz. The city was placed under martial law on October 13, the fifth day of a national protest organized by trade unions and peasant organizations against a proposal to build a pipeline for the export of Bolivia’s natural gas reserves. The government has accused opposition activists of fomenting a coup. Most of the deaths reportedly occurred when army units backed by tanks tried to secure safe passage for convoys of gasoline tankers headed for La Paz. The capital has been virtually cut off by road blockades for several days. Troops fired tear gas at homes and also opened fire using live ammunition, as well as rubber bullets, on protesters. Heavy machine guns were also reportedly used. Scores of protesters were hurt, and the great majority of those injured sustained gunshot wounds. Some of the victims were women and children. Observers said that most of the protesters were armed only with sticks, stones and slingshots, although there were also reports that sticks of dynamite were used at roadblocks. Yesterday, 26 people were reportedly killed as protests continued in the streets of La Paz, according to Bolivian human rights groups. Thousands of demonstrators had made their way from El Alto to the capital, calling for President Sánchez de Lozada to resign. “The large number of deaths strongly suggests that security forces failed to exercise proper care in responding to the protests,” said Vivanco. Under international standards, the intentional use of lethal force by law enforcement officials is permissible only when strictly unavoidable to protect life. President Sánchez de Lozada on Monday told a news conference that his government had decided to postpone a decision on the exports of natural gas until further consultations are held. Trade union and peasant leaders, however, considered the offer too little, too late, and are stepping up protests in the hope of forcing the government to resign.","Americas, Bolivia",""

A verdict in the seven-year trial, the longest in Malaysia’s history, is expected to be announced on October 14. A prominent advocate for the rights of migrants and women in Malaysia for decades, Fernandez helped found the Kuala Lumpur-based rights organization Tenanganita (“Women’s Force”) in 1991. Human Rights Watch in 1996 honored Fernandez as a human rights defender. In 1995 Tenaganita released a report documenting beatings, sexual violence against detainees by prison guards, and inadequate food and water in Malaysia’s immigration detention camps. Fernandez was arrested in March 1996 and charged with malicious publication of false news under the restrictive Printing Presses and Publications Act of 1984. Later released on bail, Fernandez stands to be fined or even imprisoned for publishing the report. “Irene Fernandez should never have been charged for speaking out against the abuse of migrants,” said Brad Adams, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch’s Asia division. “Imposing criminal penalties would send a message that the Malaysian government, on the eve of a historic political transition, is still willing to use the law to silence its critics.” The court’s verdict, originally scheduled to be announced in March 2004, was pushed up unexpectedly by the presiding judge, and comes just weeks before Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed hands power over to Abdullah Badawi, the deputy prime minister and minister of home affairs. If Fernandez is convicted, her punishment would mark yet another chapter in Malaysia’s use of the law to stifle free expression under the Mahathir government, which came to power in 1981. Using various repressive laws, of which the Printing Presses and Publications Act is but one example, Malaysia’s government has seriously constrained non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the media and opposition political parties in violation of international standards on free expression and free association. Malaysia’s record on migrants over the past two decades is equally poor. Although long a favored destination for both migrant laborers and refugees, Malaysia has developed a record of abuse against both groups. Most recently, the government has blocked Acehnese asylum seekers from Indonesia from registering with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) office in Kuala Lumpur. “Rather than putting one of Malaysia’s most committed activists on trial for more than seven years, the Malaysian government should work to address the key issues that Irene Fernandez and Tenanganita have brought to light,” said Adams. “The court should end this marathon case and let Irene Fernandez get on with her work.”","Asia, Malaysia","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Migrants, Domestic Workers, Refugees and Migrants"

In a joint letter to donor governments -- including Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, the Netherlands, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom -- the NGOs said that the bilateral talks between Bhutan and Nepal had failed to deliver a solution. At the same time, the NGOs said that a proposal put forward by Ruud Lubbers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), to promote local integration in Nepal and resettlement in third countries did not offer a solution for most of the refugees and would compromise their right to return to their homes. The six NGOs -- including Amnesty International, Habitat International Coalition, Human Rights Watch, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Lutheran World Federation, and the Bhutanese Refugee Support Group -- warned that UNHCR's decision to phase out assistance for the refugee camps in southeast Nepal would leave 100,000 Bhutanese refugees in a precarious position. """"The refugees have consistently expressed their desire to go home,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Human Rights Watch's Refugee Policy Advisor. """"UNHCR's proposal is not a solution. It does not uphold the refugees' right to return and lets Bhutan off the hook for expelling them in the first place."""" The NGOs stressed that UNHCR's decision to phase out assistance for the refugee camps puts the onus on the international community to find a solution to the refugee crisis, one of the most protracted in the world. They called on donors to convene an international conference bringing all the stakeholders together - including U.N. agencies, governments, and refugee representatives - to find a comprehensive solution for all the refugees. Similar frameworks were successfully developed in the 1980s and 1990s for large refugee populations from Indochina and the Balkans. Over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees - an estimated one sixth of the population of Bhutan - have been living in camps in southeast Nepal since the early 1990s when they were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality and forcibly expelled from Bhutan in one of the largest ethnic expulsions in the world. The U.N. refugee agency, with the help of NGOs, has been providing assistance to the refugees since 1992. But UNHCR has been systematically excluded from efforts by Bhutan and Nepal to bilaterally resolve the refugee crisis over the past ten years, and the government of Bhutan has flatly denied UNHCR access to the country, which is normally granted in most refugee situations. In June 2003, the governments of Bhutan and Nepal announced the results of a joint screening process to identify the status of the refugees in one of the camps and determine who could return to Bhutan. According to the screening, less than three percent of the refugees would be able to return to Bhutan with full citizenship rights and tens of thousands could be rendered stateless. NGOs rejected the process as flawed and the results invalid. It has also been called into question by UNHCR and other governments. """"UNHCR and the international community are right to reject the deeply flawed screening process agreed between Bhutan and Nepal,"""" said Peter Prove, Assistant to the General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. """"It is time for donor governments to take decisive action to help resolve the refugee crisis and bring to an end the refugees' forced exile."""" The 15th round of joint ministerial talks between Bhutan and Nepal is due to take place in Thimpu, Bhutan from October 20 to 23.","Asia, Bhutan, Nepal",""

The briefing paper said that the government’s manipulation of election procedures, repression of the political opposition, and violence against the opposition have undermined a free and fair vote on October 15. “Azerbaijan has a sorry history of election fraud and abuse, and the current presidential election is shaping up to be more of the same,” said Peter Bouckaert, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch, who is in Baku. “Too much manipulation, too many arrests, and too many beatings of opposition activists have taken place already to consider the election process free and fair.” Human Rights Watch research found that the government has heavily intervened in the campaigning process in favor of Prime Minister Ilham Aliev, son of current President Heidar Aliev. The government has stacked the Central Election Commission and local election commission with its supporters, and banned local nongovernmental organizations from monitoring the vote. As the elections draw nearer, government officials have openly sided with the campaign of Ilham Aliev, constantly obstructing opposition rallies and attempting to limit public participation in opposition events. In some cases, local officials have closed all the roads into town during opposition rallies, or have extended working and school hours—on one occasion, even declaring a Sunday work day—to prevent participation in opposition rallies. Police violence and arbitrary arrests have been endemic during the campaigning period. Police have beaten and arbitrarily detained hundreds of opposition activists, including a seventy-three-year-old woman. Several major opposition rallies have been violently dispersed by the police, with scores of injuries. Local officials have also participated in pre-election intimidation and attacks, beating opposition supporters with impunity. Human Rights Watch welcomed the large number of international observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Council of Europe, and various embassies who have been deployed in Azerbaijan, and credited the international presence with somewhat lowering abuses. However, Azerbaijani authorities continue to abuse the opposition, often in full view of international observers, seriously calling into question the government’s commitment to the principles of democracy and human rights. The OSCE called the last elections in Azerbaijan, the 2000 Parliamentary elections, “a crash course in the different methodologies of manipulation.” “You can’t have a free and fair election when opposition activists get beaten and arrested every day, and major opposition candidates are forced to hold their rallies in tiny venues,” said Bouckaert. Human Rights Watch called on the government of Azerbaijan to immediately stop harassing the opposition and supporters and to desist from intimidation on election day. Human Rights Watch further called on the international community to make election reform—particularly to ensure balanced election commissions and access for domestic monitoring groups—a condition for deepening of relations with Azerbaijan.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

On the fourth anniversary of the military coup that brought General Musharraf to power, Human Rights Watch called on him to immediately return the country to constitutional rule. Human Rights Watch pointed out in its letter that military agencies have frequently tortured and harassed political opponents, critical journalists, and former government officials. The past four years have also seen a rise in activity by extremist religious groups and an increase in sectarian killings in Pakistan, in part due to the Musharraf government's policy of marginalizing mainstream opposition political groups. Opposition legislators have told Human Rights Watch they have been beaten, harassed and subjected to blackmail for opposing Musharraf's policies. """"In Pakistan, the judiciary has been emasculated, political parties rendered powerless, and extremist and sectarian religious parties strengthened under Musharraf's rule,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"General Musharraf should transfer power to a legitimate government now."""" Pakistan's parliamentary opposition has contested Musharraf's efforts to ensure that federal and provincial governments remain subordinate to the military. The Musharraf administration has sidelined the mainstream political opposition and negotiated only with the Muttahida Majlis-e-Ama, an alliance of religious political parties that have historically enjoyed close links with the Pakistan military. However, even these negotiations broke down recently over General Musharraf's refusal to provide a date by which he would resign as army chief in exchange for being elected president of Pakistan in a civilian capacity. The growing influence of extremist religious elements has impinged on the rights of women and religious minorities. Laws regarding rape and honor killings still discriminate against women. The number of blasphemy cases registered has risen while discrimination and persecution on grounds of religion persist. Adherents of the Shi'a branch of Islam have faced numerous violent attacks by Sunni Muslim militant groups. Human Rights Watch also raised concerns about Pakistan's collaboration with the United States in the so-called war on terror. """"Pakistan's collaboration in the U.S. 'war on terror' has been exemplified by a disregard for due process.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/08/open-letter-donor-governments-bhutanese-refugees","Open letter to donor governments on Bhutanese refugees","Open letter to donor governments on Bhutanese refugees","","10/08/2003","Your Excellency,   We appreciate the concerns that your Government has expressed at the deeply troubling situation of the Bhutanese refugees in Nepal.   As the High Commissioner noted in his speech at the opening session of UNHCR's Executive Committee meeting held in Geneva last week, there is a critical need for urgent measures to resolve this situation after twelve years of stalemate. The situation has become even more disturbing with the deteriorating security situation in the country and the withdrawal of police presence from the camps, which has left the refugees without adequate security.   We understand UNHCR's frustration at its exclusion from the verification process and its inability to ensure repatriation for the Bhutanese refugees. However, we do not see the High Commissioner's proposal to gradually withdraw assistance from the camps, to promote local integration in Nepal, and to support third country resettlement, as leading to an outcome that reinforces the right of the refugees to return home - a right that the majority of refugees have indicated they wish to exercise. Nor does it hold the Government of Bhutan accountable for its international obligations to respect the refugees' right to return.   As you know, the undersigned NGOs have been monitoring this situation for quite some time. Some of our organizations recently undertook a joint mission to India and Nepal, where the delegates met with many refugees as well as Government officials and staff of UNHCR and NGOs. During the mission, refugees expressed their desire to be able to return to their homes and properties in Bhutan as full citizens and in conditions of safety and dignity. They told the visiting delegates that they believed only UNHCR could guarantee their security on return.   The undersigned NGOs have also provided extensive and very critical analysis of the deeply flawed verification process which the Governments of Nepal and Bhutan have conducted in Khudunabari camp without UNHCR involvement.   While we note the extraordinary sensitivity and complexity of the situation and the unhelpful attitudes of the Bhutanese and Indian governments, it is vital that fundamental international standards not be compromised. To do so would not only violate the rights of the Bhutanese refugees but also seriously undermine the international refugee system at a time when it is under unprecedented attack from many directions. A decision not to insist on the refugees' right to voluntary repatriation would condone the arbitrary deprivation of nationality on the basis of ethnicity.   We therefore urge you to coordinate your diplomatic, political and economic efforts to:  Ensure that Bhutanese refugees are able to make fully informed and voluntary choices about their futures.  Insist on the right of Bhutanese refugees to return to their country with full protection due to them under international law, including the right to return to their original homes and properties and, where this is not possible, to receive full compensation.  Insist that there should only be two categories in the verification process - Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese. (In the case of the verification already undertaken in Khudunabari camp, all those persons classified in categories I, II and IV should be treated as Bhutanese and be enabled to return to Bhutan as full citizens in safety and dignity.) For those classified as non-Bhutanese, a full, fair and independent appeals process should be established.  Insist that UNHCR should be involved in the verification and appeals process.  Ensure international monitoring of the repatriation process by UNHCR, which has the mandate and the expertise for this task. It is vital that only an agency with a protection mandate and relevant experience should be given the responsibility of monitoring this return.  Support UNHCR to promote local integration and third country resettlement for those refugees who are unable or unwilling to return to Bhutan.  Ensure that no child is rendered stateless or separated from his/her family as a result of the verification and return process.  Ensure that women are individually registered and protected from gender discrimination through the entire process.  Ensure that refugee representatives are consulted and involved at all stages of the process.  Encourage the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights to address the human rights implications of this situation.   The situation of the Bhutanese refugees has reached an impasse. The bilateral process has so far totally failed to respect the rights of the refugees or to achieve a durable solution for them. It is time for the donor states to Nepal and Bhutan to convene an international conference, bringing all stakeholders together, including UN agencies and refugee representatives, to devise a comprehensive solution to this protracted refugee situation that meets international standards and gives due consideration to each of the durable solutions: voluntary repatriation, local integration and third country resettlement.   It is vital that all those who care about the protection of these refugees and, by extension, the integrity of the international refugee system, use their influence to address this issue with the greatest urgency.

On October 6, the government announced that it had forwarded its nine-month-long investigation to the attorney general for a decision on whether to prosecute. The government began investigating the popular online news outlet for posting a letter to the editor on January 9 that criticized government policies favoring ethnic Malays. “Malaysiakini is one of the few independent media voices in Malaysia,” said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “The government has been investigating Malaysiakini for almost ten months for simply posting a political letter. It’s time to close the case and move on.” An official of the United Malay National Organization (UMNO), the party that dominates Malaysia’s ruling coalition, called the letter “seditious” and claimed that Malaysiakini’s decision to publish it was “very dangerous to the harmony of this country.” Another UMNO official called for prosecution of the website’s publishers under Malaysia’s Sedition Act in order to “teach them a lesson.” The police raided Malaysiakini’s offices on January 20 and confiscated 15 computers and four servers. The police have returned most of the equipment, but still hold two computers for possible use in court as evidence. The Malaysian government has frequently stated that it will not censor the Internet, in part to attract international investment to its high-technology sector. In 1996, Malaysia introduced the Multimedia Super Corridor Bill of Guarantee, which stated that the government would “ensure no Internet censorship.” Malaysiakini began operating in November 1999, and has since become one of the leading independent Internet news outlets in Malaysia. It is one of a handful of print and online publications that offer an alternative view to Malaysia’s largely pro-government mainstream media, much of which is owned by large corporations affiliated with UMNO. Because Malaysiakini is available only online and not in print form, it is not subject to many of the onerous licensing requirements that print publications must follow. “This controversy is not just about the staff of Malaysiakini,” said Adams. “It’s about the right of all Malaysians to receive news and opinion unfiltered by the government. Malaysiakini has been singled out precisely because it does what many other news sources in Malaysia don’t do: it criticizes all sides, including the government. It shouldn’t be investigated or punished for doing so.” Media freedom is a particularly sensitive issue in Malaysia as the country gears up for national elections, which may be called as early next year. During Malaysia’s hard-fought 1999 elections, opposition parties—some running for the first time—complained that they could not get a fair hearing because of the media’s heavy bias in favor of the UMNO.","Asia, Malaysia","Press Freedom"

The report blamed national authorities for the spread of HIV to villagers who sold their blood in the province. A local court in Henan sentenced Ma Shiwen, deputy director of the Office of Disease Control in the Henan Health Department, to at least eight years of imprisonment for allegedly circulating the internal report to Chinese AIDS activists. """"The Chinese government is targeting honest health officials, but it has done little to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Henan,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"China must release Ma Shiwen immediately and instead hold accountable the government officials responsible for this crisis."""" In the early 1990s, Henan's state-run blood collection centers used unsafe practices that spread HIV to villagers who sold their blood. The government has said that several thousand Henan residents were infected with HIV as a result, but local activists and doctors say the number is closer to one million. Provincial police have expelled Chinese and international journalists attempting to report on the province's AIDS epidemic. Communist Party and hospital authorities have harassed and threatened outspoken doctors in Henan. In May and June, police jailed HIV-positive protestors who demanded treatment and alleged that provincial authorities had misappropriated medical funds. Ma was arrested in August and charged with circulating state secrets by using his computer to send the report to AIDS activists in China; earlier in the year he had been arrested and released on the same charges. AIDS activist Wan Yanhai, director of the Beijing-based AIDS organization Aizhi Action, had circulated the same report in 2002. Chinese authorities detained him in August 2002, and released him a month later following international outcry over his arrest. The report by the Henan health department blamed the national Ministry of Health, the army, illegal blood collection centers, and the lack of information about HIV/AIDS for the catastrophic spread of HIV in Henan. China has signed and ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Article 12 of the Covenant, which guarantees the right to the highest attainable standard of health, has been authoritatively interpreted to say that """"States should refrain from ... censoring, withholding or intentionally misrepresenting health-related information, as well as from preventing people's participation in health-related matters"""" (paragraph 34, General Comment No. 14). Henan authorities had restricted access to the internal report that condemned government authorities for their role in the blood scandal on the grounds that it is a state secret. Human Rights Watch pointed out that the 1996 Johannesburg Principles, a non-binding but widely recognized statement on national security, freedom of expression and access to information, states: """"Everyone has the right to obtain information from public authorities, including information relating to national security. No restriction on this right may be imposed on the ground of national security unless the government can demonstrate that the restriction is prescribed by law and is necessary in a democratic society to protect a legitimate national security interest."""" To date, there has been no official investigation of state responsibility for the spread of HIV in the province, and some officials linked to the scandal have been promoted. """"China should investigate the role of authorities in the Henan blood scandal and the spread of HIV,"""" Adams said. """"The government should provide adequate compensation and appropriate treatment to those persons who contracted HIV/AIDS as a result of government negligence or recklessness.""""

Sixty-two men were reportedly rounded up on August 28 by Cairo police, who used police wagons to block either end of a Nile bridge reputed to be a meeting place for men who have sex with men, then arrested men along the bridge. The men were held for three days in Qasr al-Nil police station in central Cairo where, according to a defense lawyer, they were verbally abused. They were freed on bail after being charged with the """"habitual practice of debauchery,"""" the provision under Egypt's penal code used to legitimize arrests for homosexual conduct. The men face up to three years' imprisonment if found guilty at trials now scheduled for October and November. """"These arrests are only the latest in a two-year official campaign against homosexual conduct,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Many of those detained in the past have been tortured in detention."""" The men targeted by the police face rejection by their families and communities regardless of the prosecution's outcome. Meanwhile, the police have continued to entrap gay men on """"debauchery"""" charges by soliciting them over the Internet. Human rights activists have documented 15 cases since January 2001 in which men have been arrested after police solicited them over the Internet. Appeals courts have sometimes overturned """"debauchery"""" convictions when based on flimsy evidence or entrapment. Appeals do not always succeed, even when the evidence is suspect or the defendant was entrapped. Human Rights Watch is concerned by the continuing imprisonment of Wissam Toufic Abyad, a 26-year-old Lebanese citizen arrested on January 16, in the Cairo suburb of Heliopolis, after he had arranged to meet with a man called """"Raoul,"""" whom he had met through a gay personals advertisement site on the Internet. The Heliopolis Court of Misdemeanors on January 20 sentenced Abyad to 15 months' imprisonment for the """"habitual practice of debauchery,"""" for advertising """"against public morals,"""" and for """"inciting passersby … to commit indecent acts."""" On February 17, an appeals court upheld his conviction; his case is being appealed to the Court of Cassation, Egypt's highest body of judicial review. Zaki Saad Zaki Abd al-Malak, 23, also remains imprisoned. Malak was solicited by police over the Internet in January 2002. He told human rights activists that police beat him daily during two weeks of detention in the Agouza Police Station in Cairo. At one meeting with his lawyer, he appeared with dried blood still crusted on his face. On February 7, 2002, Malak was convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment, followed by three years' police supervision. The sentence was upheld on appeal. A further appeal is pending before the Court of Cassation. Also with Malak in Borg al-Arab prison are 12 men arrested in Cairo's Agouza district on August 19, 2002. They were arrested at a party to which they had been invited by a police informer known as """"Sherif,"""" nicknamed """"Mishmisha"""" (or """"Apricot""""). Police broke into the party and took all of the guests into custody. Human Rights Watch knows of a total of 23 men who have been arrested after they were entrapped by """"Sherif"""" in three separate incidents since 2001. According to the 12 men arrested, police beat them with a baton in the Giza Security Directorate. They were sentenced to three years' imprisonment on November 12, 2002. Their sentences were upheld on appeal in February, and they remain in prison. The prisoners report that they are held in isolation, with extremely limited access to exercise or fresh air.

The October 7 summit, to be held in Yalta, marks the single most important meeting of the year between the European Union and Ukraine. Human Rights Watch called on EU leaders to use the summit to seek specific improvements in Ukraine’s human rights record, particularly in the areas of eliminating torture and ill-treatment of prisoners, guaranteeing freedom of expression, and addressing discrimination against women in the labor force. “EU leaders should make clear to the Ukrainian government that respect for human rights is a precondition for deepening of relations,” said Rachel Denber, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “A high-level meeting of this kind without specific concessions would not only be an important opportunity missed—it would also represent a serious blow to those brave individuals in Ukraine who have risked their personal safety to speak out against abuse.” On a number of occasions, the European Union has publicly acknowledged shortcomings in Ukraine’s respect of human rights, giving rise to hope that it would use the summit to seek concrete commitments to address them. Most recently, a September 16 statement on the third anniversary of the “disappearance” and murder of Ukrainian journalist Georgiy Gongadze expressed concern about the lack of progress in the investigation into his death and continuing violations of freedom of expression in general. EU-Ukraine relations have reached a crucial turning point with the impending enlargement of the European Union. As part of its “Wider Europe” strategy, the European Union is currently working on a new framework for relations with its eastern and southern neighbors, including Ukraine—countries that it defines as “not currently hav[ing] a perspective of membership but who will soon find themselves sharing a border with the Union.” Individualized “Action Plans” for each country will form a key component of this process, and include political and economic benchmarks by which to judge progress. Human Rights Watch called on EU leaders to advance the following specific benchmarks as part of their engagement with Ukraine: To address torture and prison conditions: The European Union should reinforce the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe that the Ukrainian government evaluate the degree to which law and practice related to pretrial custody fully guarantee the rights of persons deprived of their liberty. It should insist that custody pending trial be considered an exceptional measure, rather than routine practice, and that police not use administrative detention as a means of detaining individuals when there are not sufficient grounds for holding them as criminal suspects. It should call on the government to ensure that the Ministry of Internal Affairs issue instructions calling on all police officers to strictly observe due process when detaining people. To address violations of media freedom: The European Union should condition any deepening of relations with Ukraine on demonstrable progress by the Ukrainian government in guaranteeing freedom of expression. It should insist that Ukraine undertake sustained and effective measures to prevent and punish official censorship, to eliminate arbitrary administrative and legal actions against television stations and other media outlets, and to end harassment of and violence against journalists. To address discrimination against women in the labor force: The European Union should integrate gender discrimination as a key component of its ongoing dialogue with Ukraine on trafficking of women. It should press for such discrimination to be outlawed and penalized, and assist the Ukrainian government in harmonizing its legislation to meet EU standards on nondiscrimination and equal treatment in employment. Finally, it should strengthen labor rights conditionality in the EU-Ukraine bilateral market access trade agreements designed to promote Ukraine’s access to the World Trade Organization.","Europe/Central Asia, Ukraine",""

Human Rights Watch urged the delegates to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's annual Human Dimension Implementation Meeting, held in Warsaw on October 6-17, to raise the cases of civil society groups at risk. In a letter to Kyrgyz President Askar Akaev, Human Rights Watch said that government tactics were endangering the work and the very existence of essential nongovernmental organizations in the country. """"Kyrgyz organizations are working hard to improve human rights conditions for everyone,"""" said Rachel Denber, acting director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Their work should be supported. Instead, we're seeing the Kyrgyz government using crass maneuvers to eliminate these groups."""" Human Rights Watch expressed concern regarding the effective deregistration of one of Kyrgyzstan's leading human rights groups, the Kyrgyz Committee for Human Rights (KCHR). On September 24, the Kyrgyz Ministry of Justice re-registered selected former members of the group as the KCHR, thereby stripping the original leadership of registration. The group's long-time head, Ramazan Dyryldaev, said the men registered by the ministry had not been elected by the members of the group. He and international observers characterized the move as a government attempt to sabotage an independent group with a critical voice. The government attempted the same move in 1998, but reversed the decision in 1999 following international protest. In its letter to President Akaev, Human Rights Watch welcomed the government's decision, taken just prior to the OSCE meeting, to re-register the Coalition for Democracy and Civil Society. The group had been rejected three times under various pretexts and appeared to be on the verge of losing its legal status. International outcry is credited with having convinced the Kyrgyz government to finally register the group. """"The incident with the Coalition for Democracy and Civil Society is more proof that the international community can be effective when it speaks out against government attacks on rights groups,"""" said Denber. """"Delegates at the OSCE Human Dimension Implementation Meeting should use the opportunity of that gathering to highlight the harassment that Kyrgyz groups face."""" The Ministry of Justice had previously rejected the Coalition's application by claiming that the group violated Article 8 of Kyrgyzstan's constitution, which limits the activities of foreign groups but not local ones. Article 8 prohibits """"Activities of foreign political parties, non-governmental and religious organizations, including their representative offices and branches, which pursue political goals…"""" In its letter, Human Rights Watch said that Kyrgyz authorities should clarify the constitutional provision so it could not be manipulated this way again. Human Rights Watch raised the issue of government hostility toward rights advocates in its June 2003 letter to the European Union.","Europe/Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan",""

Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, D.C. 20500   October 6, 2003   Re: HIV/AIDS and Women's Rights in Kenya and Uganda    Dear President Bush:   Your visit to Africa in July and your HIV/AIDS initiative for Africa and the Caribbean are signs of your concern about the devastating effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We share your concern, and are particularly alarmed at how violence and discrimination against women are fueling the spread of AIDS in Africa.   As you meet with Kenyan President Mwai Kibaki today and continue your dialog with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, we hope you will emphasize to them the importance of focusing on women's rights within the fight against HIV/AIDS. This letter describes the findings from our research on women's rights violations in Kenya and Uganda and how they relate to the HIV/AIDS epidemic.   Kenya: Women's Property Rights Violations and HIV/AIDS   Women's rights to property are unequal to those of men in Kenya. Their rights to own, inherit, manage, and dispose of property are under constant attack from customs, laws, and individuals who believe that women do not deserve or are incapable of handling property. Women in Kenya constitute 80 percent of the agricultural labor force yet own only 5 percent of the land. The devastating effects of property rights violations including poverty, disease, violence, and homelessness harm women, their children, and Kenya's overall development.   Abuses of women's property rights in Kenya take many forms. For example:  Divorced and separated women are often left with only the clothes on their backs as their husbands keep the home and other property.  Widows are often evicted from their homes as in-laws rob them of their possessions and invade their homes and lands. These unlawful appropriations are said to happen even more readily when the husband is believed to have died of AIDS.  In some regions, widows are forced to undergo customary, sexual practices such as """"wife inheritance"""" or ritual """"cleansing"""" in order to keep their property. """"Wife inheritance"""" is where a male relative of the deceased husband takes the widow as a wife, often in what amounts to a forced marriage. """"Cleansing"""" usually involves coerced sex with a social outcast, supposedly to cleanse the woman of her deceased husband's evil spirits.   The staggering number of AIDS deaths expected in Kenya in the coming years will result in millions more women becoming widows at younger ages than would otherwise be the case. These women and their children are likely to face not only social stigma against people affected by HIV/AIDS but also deprivations caused by property rights violations. Women with AIDS face an early death when their homes, lands, and other property are taken. They not only lose assets they could use for medical care, but also shelter they need to endure this debilitating disease.   In August, Human Rights Watch visited a group of women and men who live in one of Nairobi's most impoverished slums and who are infected or affected by HIV/AIDS. Like many other slum dwellers, the members of the Solosia Welfare Organization have banded together to provide each other support. Many of the women in the group had suffered property rights violations when their husbands died, losing everything they needed to survive. The group asked us to send the letter to you that is attached to this letter and is based on our conversation with them.   As you meet with President Kibaki today, we hope you will express your concern about how women's property rights violations fuel the spread of AIDS and will urge President Kibaki to:  Enact legislation and constitutional provisions that prohibit gender-based discrimination and promote women's equal property rights; Undertake programmatic and institutional reforms to better prevent and remedy women's property rights violations, including within HIV/AIDS programs; and Provide civic education and training to government officials and traditional leaders on women's property rights.   Moreover, we hope that the U.S. government will ensure that aid provided to Kenya, including assistance relating to HIV/AIDS, is used to improve women's equal property rights.   Uganda: Domestic Violence and HIV/AIDS   Despite Uganda's acknowledged success in reducing HIV/AIDS prevalence rates, the threats from AIDS are far from over. Many thousands of Ugandan women are becoming infected with HIV, and will eventually die of AIDS, because the government is failing to protect them from domestic violence. Our recent report, """"Just Die Quietly: Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV in Uganda,"""" documents widespread rape and brutal attacks on women by their husbands in Uganda, where a domestic violence law has not been enacted and where spousal rape is not criminalized. Uganda's popular campaigns promoting condom use, abstinence, and monogamy-while limiting somewhat the spread of AIDS-fail to address the ways in which domestic violence inhibits women's control over sexual matters in marriage and minimize the complex causal factors of violence. Education on sexual abstinence will not help women and girls in Uganda and many parts of Africa if they lack autonomy in their marriages and sexual lives.   As with Kenya, property rights in Uganda are essential to economic survival. Women's unequal property and inheritance rights in Uganda contribute to women's poverty and place them at a social disadvantage. Women often have no choice but to remain in abusive relationships: without effective property rights, they simply have no alternatives. This dilemma was reiterated by a group of women Human Rights Watch met in Uganda in August. The women of the Sibabinwere Women's Group, a grassroots support group for women with HIV/AIDS near Kampala, told us that when their husbands died or they divorced, they lost the land and possessions they needed to survive and care for their children. These women asked that we send the attached letter to you.   As you continue your dialog with President Museveni, we hope that you will emphasize the links between domestic violence and women's vulnerability to HIV. In particular, we hope that you will urge the Ugandan government to:  Enact laws that prohibit and redress domestic violence and criminalize marital rape;  Amend discriminatory marriage and property laws; Make women's health, physical integrity, and equal rights in marriage a central focus of HIV/AIDS programming and awareness campaigns; and Support nongovernmental organizations that work on domestic violence, including those that target men and aim to prevent domestic violence and offer shelters, counseling, legal advice, and health services.   Finally, we wish to underscore that the global catastrophe of HIV/AIDS requires a coordinated global response. While we appreciate your intention to move the United States forward as a leader in the fight against HIV/AIDS, we are concerned that by emphasizing bilateral initiatives and straying from internationally coordinated efforts such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the United States will miss important opportunities to effectively combat the scourge of AIDS.   Sincerely,  LaShawn R. Jefferson Executive Director Women's Rights Division   CC: President Mwai Kibaki President Yoweri Museveni       Enclosures:        Letter from the Solosia Welfare Organization, Nairobi, Kenya    Dear President Bush:   Greetings from the Solosia Welfare Organization. We are a group of slum dwellers from Mukuru kwa Njenga in Nairobi. Since you were not able to visit Kenya when you came to Africa, we wanted to write you this letter.   We in the Mukuru kwa Njenga slum have many problems. We are hungry, we need clothing, many of us have HIV/AIDS, and it is difficult to educate our children. Many of the women living in our slum have lost their homes and property when they became widows or were chased away by their husbands. All of us are worried about losing our meager homes in the slum because we don't have title for the land. Sometimes, officials even demolish our homes. We don't know where to turn for assistance. We need information centers in our neighborhood.   Many of the children in our slum are AIDS orphans. We try to take care of them, but it is hard to meet their needs for food, education, clothing, and medicine. Some of the children have dropped out of school and are inhaling glue.   Some of the women in our organization provide home-based care to people suffering from AIDS. They aren't trained in medicine, but they do what they can to help the sick people. We wish we had more clinics or a hospital to care for the people in our slum.   We want to be able to sustain ourselves, but we need assistance to get started. We hope that you will be able to help us.   Sincerely,   The Solosia Welfare Organization       Letter from the Sibabinwere Women's Group, Kisasi, Uganda  Dear President Bush:   We are a group of Ugandan women that supports each other with HIV/AIDS care and with income-generating projects. All of us have lost property, like our homes, land, or other items, when we became widows or when we divorced.   When you came to Uganda, you promised to help people with HIV/AIDS. We thank you for your promise, and would like to know when it will be fulfilled so that we can get immediate help.   Ugandan women who are HIV positive are in a bad state. Many are weak and close to dying. But the medicine the women need is expensive, and many don't have enough money for it. It is also expensive to pay for transport to the hospital to get medication. Some of us are homeless and are struggling to educate our children.   We hope that the United States will quickly send assistance for women with HIV/AIDS and that it will reach groups like ours.

In an apparent attempt to appease the military government in Burma, Thai authorities on September 29 ordered Dr. Cynthia Maung and her staff of more than 100 medics and teachers at the Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot to prepare for deportation. Dr. Cynthia runs a desperately needed humanitarian medical clinic along the Thai-Burma border. Last year, she was honored with the prestigious Ramon Magsaysay Award, created and funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Fund of New York, for community leadership. Medics and teachers at the clinic had work permits that expired on September 25 after Thailand´s cabinet passed a resolution in August prohibiting more than 12,000 alien workers from renewing their work permits. “If deported to Burma, Dr. Cynthia and her staff—most of whom are ethnic Karens—would face a serious risk of arbitrary detention and mistreatment by Burma´s brutal military government,” said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch´s Asia Division. Thailand is prohibited under customary international law from returning persons to a country where they would face persecution (refoulement). Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) in Burma would single out Dr. Cynthia and Mae Tao Clinic workers because they provide health and other services to individuals fleeing persecution in Burma. The SPDC has in the past called Dr. Cynthia and her staff “absconders, insurgents and terrorists.” Human Rights Watch called on Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to put humanitarian and human rights concerns above apparent efforts to appease a government in Rangoon that has ruled Burma by force for over 40 years. “Thailand should support the efforts of those trying to help victims of the military government in Burma rather than put them in danger or threaten them with legal sanctions,” said Adams. “Why is the Thai government threatening to crack down on vulnerable humanitarian workers who have done nothing more than help sick people?” In 1988, Dr. Cynthia founded the Mae Tao Clinic in Mae Sot in northwestern Thailand, after she escaped from Burma. Since then, the clinic has tended to the medical needs of Burmese refugees living in Thailand. Without the clinic, many people in the area would have no access to medical care. The clinic treats as many as 150 patients each day. Clinic doctors also train volunteer “backpack medics,” who cross the border to provide vital medical assistance to villagers in Burma. “Closing the Mae Tao Clinic would also threaten its patients´ right to health,” said Adams. “It is highly unlikely that any other agency would offer health services to this population if the clinic is closed.” Thailand is a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which states that everyone has a right to the highest attainable standard of health. Forcing the clinic to close without providing an alternative source of medical care would violate Thailand´s obligations under the treaty. Human Rights Watch and other organizations have reported widespread abuses by the Burmese military, particularly in border areas where non-Burman ethnic groups predominate. Villages are often destroyed, and the residents forced to relocate. The army regularly requires villagers to provide unpaid labor, such as in building roads or working as porters for soldiers. Residents of Burma´s seven ethnic states face the constant threat of arbitrary detention, torture, rape and murder by the military. As many as two million Burmese citizens reside in Thailand. Approximately 125,000 live in camps near the Burmese border, but the rest are classified by Thailand as “illegal immigrants.” Thailand has not signed the 1951 Refugee Convention, and has no legal process to determine whether immigrants face a well-founded fear of persecution in Burma, which would entitle them under international law to protection as refugees.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma), Thailand","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers"

The authorities should also reveal the whereabouts of 10 others arbitrarily detained, and must charge or release them. The four men reportedly executed were among 14 detained in August by the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force (JATF), a joint unit drawn from several state security agencies. The men were apparently executed because they were accused of having links to a rebel group. The 14 detainees were taken to several secret places of detention where some were reportedly mistreated, and their current whereabouts remain unknown. Human Rights Watch learned that the Chieftaincy Military Intelligence (CMI), a security agency of the JATF, took four of the detainees, and that they were executed around September 1 in Katikamu subcounty, Luwero district in central Uganda. “The government agents implicated in serious rights violations must be prosecuted in accordance with international standards for fair trials,” said Jemera Rone, researcher in Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “As for the men arbitrarily arrested, they should be immediately charged with recognizable criminal offences and brought to trial or released without delay.” In an open letter to Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Human Rights Watch urges a full and independent investigation of the four executions, the detention of the 14 men, and the practice of detention by CMI and JATF in general. Human Rights Watch also urges the government to clarify the legal status of the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force and its relation to other security agencies, in particular the Chieftaincy Military Intelligence and the Internal Security Organization.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/10/03/invisible-enemy","An Invisible Enemy","An Invisible Enemy","The Canadian Peacekeepers Killed on Afghan Soil Are Victims of the Country's Dangerous Landmine Legacy","10/03/2003","Landmines pose an ever-present danger to everyone within the borders of Afghanistan; its citizens and the soldiers of the world charged with keeping peace for them. Last year, the Red Cross recorded 1,286 landmine deaths in Afghanistan, one of the highest mine tolls anywhere on Earth. Numerous other casualties are believed to have gone unreported. It is generally estimated that millions of landmines are scattered throughout this war-torn country. Though the new government of Afghanistan banned landmines in 2002, the country remains heavily mined, with some 344 million square metres of mined land classified as high priority for clearance. Landmines are everywhere in Afghanistan -- in urban and commercial areas, towns and villages, as well as in farmlands, grazing lands and along transport roads. According to the United Nations, over 1,500 villages in 27 of the country's 29 provinces were affected by landmines in 2002.  Yesterday, five Canadian peacekeepers became victims of Afghanistan's landmine legacy. Two Canadian soldiers were killed in the Afghan capital of Kabul, and three others were wounded. An anti-vehicle mine is believed to be cause of these deaths and casualties. It remains unknown whether the mine was newly laid, or dates from the country's decades of mine use by the many armies and factions that have battled in Afghanistan. Evidence suggests new mines have been laid in Afghanistan. According to the Landmine Monitor Report 2003, released last month by the International Campaign to Ban Landmines, there were several incidents in both 2002 and 2003 in which former Taliban, and other anti-government forces, were suspected of using, or attempting to use landmines --mainly anti-vehicle mines and radio-controlled mines -- to target foreign troops and new Afghan army forces. The Canadian mine victims join a growing list of foreign troops and deminers who have fallen victim to Afghanistan's landmines and unexploded ordnance (what's known as UXO). In 2002 and 2003, soldiers and peacekeepers from several countries including Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland and the U.S. were killed or injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance in Afghanistan as they engaged in mine clearance operations, patrolled, or undertook other activities. Last year, landmines and UXO killed five U.S. soldiers and injured 10 in Afghanistan, while 12 Afghan deminers were killed and 28 others injured in landmine and UXO accidents. In May, 2003, the first death in Afghanistan's nascent national army occurred when an Afghan soldier, who was fresh from training, stepped on a landmine while on patrol. These casualties are just the tip of the iceberg. More than 100 civilian casualties are believed to result from mines and unexploded ordnances every month in Afghanistan. Last year, the International Committee of the Red Cross reported that the country is one of the most heavily mine-affected places in the world. Still, many more casualties are believed to go unreported. Decades of conflict have had a severe impact on health care in Afghanistan, leaving much of the medical infrastructure damaged or destroyed. Unlike the foreign mine victims, many Afghans never survive long enough to reach the few hospitals that exist. To counter this continual flow of mine casualties, Afghanistan has in place one of the world's oldest and largest demining programs, employing more than 5,000 deminers. An extensive effort continues to provide mine-risk education to people living in mined areas. On Sept. 11, 2002, Afghanistan joined the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, known as the Ottawa Treaty, making it one of the first international agreements embraced by the new post-war government. Last month in Bangkok, Dr. M. Haider Reza, the deputy foreign minister of Afghanistan, led his country's first delegation to one of the treaty's annual diplomatic meetings. He warned of financial shortfalls affecting the mine clearance program and said, """"We want the refugees to come home, we want our people to be safe, we want our children to go to school. We want Afghanistan to stand strong among the nations of the world."""" For several years, Canada has been doing its part to help Afghanistan reach these goals. This support intensified with the provision of the contingent of peacekeepers who began their mission in August. In 2002 and 2003, Canada provided $8.8-million in mine-action assistance to Afghanistan. To tackle the root of the mine problem, Canada continues to push forward diplomatic efforts to ensure that the Ottawa Treaty is adhered to and implemented by all. The latest landmine deaths of Canadians serve as a sorry reminder that, despite these diplomatic, financial, humanitarian and political efforts, there is still a long way to go before we can say we have won the battle against this indiscriminate weapon.

According to our information, the men were arrested by the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force (JATF) in Kampala. In late August, four of the men were removed from JATF detention facilities by an officer of Chieftaincy Military Intelligence (CMI), which forms part of the JATF, and allegedly executed at a place in Katikamu subcounty, Luwero district. The names of three of those believed killed are Ismael Muviru, Mutwabil Walakira, and Capt. Sewamuwa Daudi; the name of the fourth man executed is unknown. The executions took place on or about September 1, 2003. A relative of Sewamuwa Daudi is said to have complained of his arrest to the Ugandan Human Rights Commission (UHRC) in September 2003, but has had no response so far. When Human Rights Watch inquired about the case, the UHRC said it had no record of the complaint.   The JATF took none of the detainees to police stations or other officially recognized places of detention, but rather to what are commonly referred to as """"safe houses"""" or """"ungazetted places of detention"""" in Kampala. Some were reportedly ill-treated. Most if not all of the detainees were said to be held at the """"safe house"""" in Clement Hills, Kampala. Their current whereabouts, however, are not known. The names of the ten remaining detainees are:   Dr. Freddie Mubiru (arrested in Kampala environs)  Lt. Muwaka Salongo  Ismael Sebuufu (aka Medi Kasuja) Sam Namutete (arrested in Kampala environs) Muzeeyi Muwanga (arrested in Kampala environs) Armstrong Okumo (detained on Kireka Road, Kampala)  Musafiri Macheko (possibly Kenyan nationality)  Sirje Loutwama Waiswa Ngobi (detained in Mbale, eastern Uganda) Lt. Iga Bukenya (said to have been arrested in Nairobi)   We are observing with growing concern that such cases of detention by government security forces such as CMI, JATF, the army, the Presidential Protection Unit (PPU), and militias close to the government are taking place frequently. In many cases the agents of these security forces wear civilian clothes with no identifying insignia.. According to testimonies we have gathered, detainees have been held in army barracks in different parts of the country, at CMI headquarters and, as in this case , at a facility controlled by the Joint Anti Terrorism Task Force in Kampala. Detainees have been held in overcrowded cells and sometimes tortured.   Human Rights Watch requests you to order a full, independent, judicial enquiry into the fourteen cases named above, with a mandate to discover where the detainees are being held, whether there were grounds for their detention, and whether the four alleged to have been executed were in fact killed. The enquiry should also investigate other alleged cases of detention by CMI and JATF, seeking to identify where detainees were held, the grounds for their detention, whether they were ill-treated or tortured, and whether any detainees died while in custody. The results of this investigation should be made public.   All government agents found to have been involved in human rights abuses-including those in charge of the locations where the detainees were held and their superior officers-should be prosecuted in accordance with international fair trial standards.

The events took place two weeks before Azerbaijan’s October 15 presidential elections. “There can’t be free and fair elections when rights advocates are beaten and international voter educators are expelled,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “The authorities in Azerbaijan must act now to stop intimidation and interference in the presidential election process, and these abuses must be investigated.” The incidents in Nakhchivan, an Azerbaijani enclave wedged between Armenia and Turkey, follow months of harassment of political activists, journalists, and other civil society actors during the lead-up to the national elections. The women’s rights advocates—including Novella Jafaroglu, chair of the Association for the Protection of Women’s Rights; Saadat Benaniarly, head of the Azerbaijan chapter of the International Society for Human Rights; and Sadagat Pashaeva, a staff member of the Association for the Protection of Women’s Rights—had set up the election-training team’s workshops for young voters in Nakhchivan. They had also been operating a women’s rights resource center in the enclave. On September 25, Jafaroglu, Benaniarly and Pashaeva went to Nakhchivan to open Bizim Nakhchivan, the first independent newspaper in the enclave. The launch of the newspaper, founded by Jafaroglu, was attended by a number of international representatives, including officials from the U.S. Embassy and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Hours before a team of six Serbian election educators, who came to Nakhchivan on a project sponsored by the Open Society Institute, were to arrive on September 27, Jafaroglu, Benaniarly, Pashaeva and Melhat Nassibova, the director of the Nakhchivan human rights resource center, arrived at the center to find a group of about 50 women in front of the building. As the four got out of their vehicle, one of the women outside shouted at them, “Are you the ones who brought the Americans and the Europeans here? We need only Iran, because Iran feeds us?” The crowd of women then attacked the activists, beating them and pelting them with tomatoes. The four then ran into the resource center and called the police, who appeared only an hour later. When police and security officials finally arrived, they advised the four that they leave Nakhchivan, saying they could not guarantee their security. The activists explained that they were expecting their Serbian guests and could not leave. The next morning Jafaroglu, Benaniarly, and Pashaeva went to Nakhchivan airport, where they were again attacked. They were about to board their plane when a woman approached them and said, “Yes, leave, and never come back again!” She then began to beat the women. A crowd of others who had been lingering nearby soon joined in the beating. Saadat Benaniarly, one of the activists, told Human Rights Watch: “Novella was on the floor, and they were kicking her and throwing eggs and tomatoes at us, all of the contents of their bags. A woman was beating me, and I was holding on to a steel pipe, trying not to fall. Another woman came and started beating my head into the pipe. Sadaget [Pashaeva] had her head banged into the floor.” The women were beaten for about 15 minutes. During the incident, government security personnel at the airport disappeared and did nothing to attempt to stop the beatings. Pointing to the unwillingness of the local authorities and the airport security personnel to come to their assistance, the women believe that the attacks were organized by the Nakhchivan local administration. The women filed a complaint with security officials in the capital, Baku. Earlier this year, several Baku-based Azerbaijani human rights defenders endured numerous incidents of mob attacks, physical harassment and intimidation that appeared to have been instigated by the authorities. (https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/05/azer053003ltr.htm) Also on September 28, the team of Serbian election educators were prevented from carrying out three scheduled workshops aimed at educating young voters. Police came to the training at the Nakhchivan resource center and ordered the participants to leave. They ordered a second team of Serbian election educators on the road to Ordubat to turn around. Security officials then told the observers that they would not be allowed to conduct their workshops or stay in Nakhchivan, and ordered them to leave the enclave, took them to the airport, and put them on a flight to Baku. International aid workers were summarily expelled from Nakhchivan. In June 2003, Nakhchivan authorities expelled a Swiss development worker and his Azerbaijani counterpart who had come to investigate the tourism potential of the region, after the two were met at the airport by Melahat Nassibova, the head of the women’s resource center. “The government should be facilitating election-monitoring, not attacking it,” said Denber. “This is particularly true for Nakhchivan, where fraud was rampant during the 2000 parliamentary elections.” Human Rights Watch called on the Azerbaijani authorities to immediately investigate the attacks on the women’s rights advocates—in particular the role of local authorities in organizing or failing to prevent the attacks—and the expulsion of the Serbian election team from Nakhchivan. Human Rights Watch also called on the Azerbaijani authorities to take greater steps to create a presidential election climate free of intimidation and interference from local and national authorities.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

Facing growing pressure to step aside, Charles Taylor, the warlord-cum- President of Liberia, finally left Monrovia for exile on August 11. Besieged by rebels, indicted by Sierra Leone’s Special Court for war crimes against humanity, and publicly told to go three times by US President George Bush, Taylor was finally escorted into exile by the presidents of South Africa, Mozambique and Ghana following a ceremonial handover of power. But exile may no longer offer comfortable retirement for the continent’s tyrants.  Charles Taylor’s exit from Liberia has thwarted any immediate possibility of his arrest by the Special Court in Sierra Leone. Taylor was indicted on June 4 as he attended the opening of peace talks in Ghana. The timing of the indictment surprised many, ending secret talks in Belgium about an exit deal for Taylor and eclipsing the Ghana negotiations.  The indictment was also a catalyst for Liberian rebels to vigorously increase their efforts to overthrow him. It set off a bloody chain of events, with Taylor seeking the lifting of the indictment as the condition for his departure. He failed to achieve this, but did accept sanctuary from President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria; he now resides in a hill-top mansion in Calabar. Soft Landing In a deal supported by West African leaders and welcomed by the UN, Taylor handed the presidency to a stop-gap government which will in turn give way in the middle of the month to a transitional national unity administration, whose chairperson will lead the country until shortly after elections in late 2005, when a new president will be elected. Even the Catholic Archbishop of Monrovia, Michael Francis, stated at Chatham House in July that the only thing he agreed with Taylor about was that he needed a ‘soft landing’, to avoid further bloodshed. Taylor’s departure was important for Liberia. He could have retreated to his jungle headquarters at Gbarnga and continued a protracted conﬂict from there. Peace talks progressed quickly once he went. Human rights non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as Amnesty International have protested loudly against such impunity for Taylor. How long he and other Liberian tyrants such as exwarlord Prince Johnson enjoy sanctuary in Nigeria remains to be seen. Johnson became infamous for his role in the torture and killing of Liberian President Samuel Doe in September 1990. This was captured on ﬁlm and became a notorious video nasty, distributed around Monrovia and beyond. Under the new peace agreement, a Liberia Truth and Reconciliation Commission will hopefully look at this and many other crimes against umanity. Taylor’s indictment will not expire and he remains vulnerable, especially if his relevance in Liberia weakens or there is a change of government in Nigeria.  Brought To Justice In recent years, quiet exile for former African despots and warlords has become less predictable. The establishment of the new International Criminal Court could also provide an important deterrent. Ninety one countries have ratiﬁed the court treaty and this July the prosecutor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, announced that his ﬁrst investigation might be into crimes in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The war crimes tribunal in Rwanda and the Special Court in Sierra Leone both also have important functions. Foday Sankoh, the former leader of the rebel Sierra Leone Revolutionary  United Front, died in the custody of the Special Court in August. The Court indicted him in March for war crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. Sankoh was among twelve people, Taylor included, indicted as bearing the greatest responsibility for these crimes. National courts and domestic and international human rights NGOs are also playing an increasingly important role. The arrest of General Augusto Pinochet in London in 1998, on a warrant from a Spanish judge for crimes allegedly committed in Chile, set a precedent from which Africa was not exempt.  Mengistu Haile Miriam, Ethiopia’s former dictator, lives in Zimbabwe but fears to travel abroad after a trip to South Africa in 1999 for medical treatment had to be cut short because South African human rights activists and the Ethiopian government issued an extradition request. Mengistu has been accused of responsibility for multiple human rights abuses, especially during the Red Terror campaign of 1977-1978. Luckily for him, the South African government ignored the request until he had left. A less known but equally signiﬁcant effort has been launched against Chad’s former President Hissene Habre. Habre ruled Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by current President Idriss Deby and ﬂed to Senegal. His tenure was marked by widespread human rights abuses. In 1992 a Truth Commission accused the Habre government of tens of thousands of political murders and systematic torture. In 1999, encouraged by the Pinochet case, a Chadian NGO teamed up with New York-based Human Rights Watch, which sent one of its most senior staff, Reed Brody, to assist in bringing Habre to justice. A coalition of NGOs was formed to support the case, a criminal complaint ﬁled in Dakar and a hearing quickly started. On February 3 2000, the judge called in Habre and indicted him on charges of torture and crimes against humanity, before the Senegalese courts ruled he could not be tried there. This ruling did not end efforts to bring Habre to justice. Some of his victims sought his extradition to Belgium, based on that country’s then law which gave its courts jurisdiction over human rights crimes worldwide. Senegal has greed to hold him pending an extradition request. Last year, a Belgian judge and police team visited Chad to investigate the charges and the Belgian  government has since announced that the Habre prosecution can go forward despite the repeal of its universal jurisdiction law. Many African leaders are also watching what is happening to former President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia. This year the Supreme Court endorsed parliament’s stripping of his immunity. He’s since been charged with sixty ﬁve counts of theft during his decade in ofﬁce up to September 2001, and given bail. Chiluba denied the charges and a trial will begin shortly. If found guilty, he could serve a maximum seven years in jail.  Undisturbed Former dictator of Uganda, Idi Amin, died in hospital in Saudi Arabia in August. He had lived in exile there for twenty ﬁve years after being ousted from power in 1979. Amin was responsible for gross human rights abuses including murder and torture, as well as the almost total exile of his country’s Asian population. He was removed by an intervention force led by Tanzania, which replaced him with former President Milton Obote. Obote’s second ﬁve-year reign was even more brutal than that of Amin. In what is today called the Luwero triangle, there are many monuments to his excesses and between  one and three hundred thousand civilians are estimated to have been killed.  Obote was himself deposed in May 1985 by a military coup and has lived for many years in Zambia. His mansion, behind high red-brick walls in a leafy upmarket Lusaka suburb, has so far been surprisingly undisturbed.  In Harare, President Robert Mugabe must be considering his choices should his term in ofﬁce come to an end. Exile destinations now require careful thought, and it is rumoured that Mugabe is looking towards Asia for possible retirement. Taylor, Habre, Sankoh and Chiluba’s recent fortunes are a warning to Africa’s leaders and warlords that they may at some point be made accountable for their actions. Unlike Idi Amin, they will not be guaranteed comfortable exile for a quarter of a century.","Africa, Chad, Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe","International Justice, International Criminal Court, Charles Taylor"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/30/israel-west-bank-barrier-endangers-basic-rights","Israel- West Bank Barrier Endangers Basic Rights","Israel: West Bank Barrier Endangers Basic Rights","U.S. Should Deduct Costs From Loan Guarantees","09/30/2003","The United States should deduct the cost of the West Bank separation barrier from U.S. loan guarantees for Israel, Human Rights Watch said today. In a letter to U.S. President George W. Bush, Human Rights Watch said the barrier's path and operating arrangements violate the freedom of movement of Palestinians, endangering their access to food, water, education, and medical services. With every mile the barrier cuts into the West Bank, towns, villages, and residents become separated from their lands, crops, services, water, and jobs. According to the World Bank, some 150,000 Palestinians will be harmed by the first phase of the barrier, which has already been completed. Other phases were likely to affect at least 150,000 more. """"Even in its first phase, the barrier is taking a terrible toll on tens of thousands of people,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"President Bush should ensure that the U.S. government does its utmost to prevent these serious violations of international law. Deducting the barrier's cost from the loan guarantees is an obvious place to start."""" Human Rights Watch recognizes that the Israeli government has a duty to protect its civilians, but notes that Israel is obliged to make sure that its security measures do not violate international human rights and humanitarian law. Under Article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), freedom of movement can be restricted for security reasons - but the restrictions should be limited to what is necessary and proportionate. As defined by the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the authoritative human rights body interpreting the ICCPR, the restrictions should not make movement the exception rather than the norm. The barrier, however, is creating walled-in enclaves confining tens of thousands of people. It will institutionalize a system in which all movement is sharply curtailed except to a handful of permit-holders, and endanger Palestinians' access to basic services like education and medical care. The Israeli government has failed to respond publicly to charges that it could adopt less intrusive and less restrictive alternatives to address the security of civilians. In fact, the Israeli State Comptroller published a report in July 2002 strongly criticizing the inadequacy of checkpoint procedures and the lack of army deployment in border areas. Even if a wall is the least intrusive method available to Israel, as planned the barrier is by definition intrusive because it is being constructed around illegal government sponsored settlements in the West Bank. These intrusions into the West Bank deprive Palestinians of land and are cutting many of them off from services such as education and health care. The Israeli government cannot use security concerns for Israelis living in illegal settlements to justify further illegal changes to occupied territory. Despite the illegality of such changes beyond the Green Line, not one of the competing proposals for the barrier's route is contiguous with the this line which is the post-1948 demarcation line between Israel and the West Bank. """"Israel has a long history of severe and arbitrary restrictions on movement,"""" Stork said. """"The barrier will institutionalize these restrictions and reinforce the long-term harm done by illegal settlements. That's why we need strong U.S. intervention, now."""" Background Human Rights Watch takes no position on the territorial dispute that lies at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, including any changes in land status that might accompany an eventual peace agreement. However, it seeks to ensure that the treatment of people living under Israeli occupation conforms to international legal standards. With this in mind, the organization has impartially and carefully monitored abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law by all parties in the Occupied Territories since 1989. On April 14, 2002, the Israeli cabinet announced that """"fences and other physical obstacles"""" were to be constructed to prevent Palestinians crossing into Israel. The government announcement, made during Israel's """"Defensive Shield"""" campaign launched after a spate of suicide attacks against Israeli civilians, said the """"buffer zones"""" were to be created in three areas along the Green Line, the post-1948 demarcation line between Israel and the West Bank. The """"fences"""" mentioned in that announcement have since become known as the separation barrier, made up of multiple obstacles that will wind through the northern and southern West Bank as well as East Jerusalem. Israeli officials refer to the barrier as the """"seam zone."""" Although many public commentators liken the barrier to the fence surrounding the Gaza Strip, the two are not alike. Most important, the separation barrier does not follow the Green Line that divides Israel from the occupied West Bank. The barrier's division of Palestinian land is what contributes to its harmful humanitarian impact on the Palestinian population. The first phase of the separation barrier was completed at the end of July 2003. It winds approximately 108 miles through the northwestern West Bank. It has resulted in the confiscation of some 2,850 acres of land and carved off some 2 percent of the total area of the West Bank. Two more phases are under construction: one in the northeast of the West Bank, and another in the region of East Jerusalem and Bethlehem. The route of a fourth phase is still under negotiation. Depending on the barrier's final route, the cost of construction is estimated at up to $1.3 billion. Although the barrier's exact elements differ according to location and topography, its core is an electrified fence, 10 feet high, equipped with surveillance cameras and other sensors. It is flanked on either side by six-foot-tall barbed-wire pyramids. Other obstacles include a trench six to eight feet in depth, a military patrol road, and a dirt path to record footprints. The barrier's total width ranges from 60 to 100 yards. In at least two locations, Qalqilya and Tulkarem, the barrier takes the shape of a 26-foot-high concrete wall with embedded guard and surveillance towers. As is common in other locations throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Israeli officials have informed local residents that all movement in the area 50-80 yards adjacent to the barrier will be forbidden. Passage through the barrier will be arranged via gates and larger terminals, although the Israeli authorities have yet to specify the basis on which people will be allowed to cross. In addition to the separation barrier, Israeli planning maps specify the creation of three """"depth barriers""""- presumably deep trenches to prevent vehicular traffic-in Jenin and Tulkarem governorates. These are to be built significantly further into the West Bank than the separation barrier's first phase. Under customary international humanitarian law, Israel has a positive obligation to ensure the welfare of residents of the West Bank (1907 Hague Regulations on Land Warfare, Article 43). It is also obliged to ensure the passage of emergency medical services, to respect the sick, to allow the passage of foodstuffs and medical goods, and to facilitate education (Fourth Geneva Convention, Articles 16, 20, 25, 50, 55 and 59). Israel is prohibited under customary international law from making permanent changes to the West Bank that do not benefit the local inhabitants (1907 Hague Regulations, Article 55), and from transferring members of its own population into the Occupied Territories (Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 49 (6)). Israel has also ratified numerous human rights treaties that oblige it to uphold rights to freedom of movement, and access to education, healthcare, work, and water. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. In August the U.N. Human Rights Committee said that """"in the current circumstances, the provisions of the [ICCPR] apply to the benefit of the population of the Occupied Territories, for all conduct by [Israeli] authorities or agents in those territories that affect the enjoyment of rights enshrined in the Covenant and fall within the ambit of State responsibility of Israel under the principles of public international law.""""","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Israel/Palestine",""

University disciplinary committees (komiteh enzebati) throughout Iran are reportedly holding hearings of students allegedly involved in pro-reform protests over the last year. The committees have suspended some students for one semester and expelled others. """"The punishment and intimidation of students for joining peaceful protests is a serious violation of academic freedom,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Students are being given a clear message: remain silent, or risk being kicked out of school."""" According to Iranian media reports, the disciplinary committee of Mazandaran University in Babolsar expelled two students solely for participating in non-violent political demonstrations, and other Mazandaran students are waiting to hear the results of their hearings. Twenty-one students at Razi University in Kermanshah have been suspended for two terms. At Ferdowsi University in Mashhad, seven students have been suspended or expelled. The disciplinary committee at Shahid Bahonar University in Kerman has reportedly expelled two students. Disciplinary committees at universities in Semnan and Tabriz have also reportedly begun holding hearings of students who were allegedly involved in protests in November 2002 and June 2003. In a statement released on September 26, the student body of Ferdowsi University in Mashhad said that the university disciplinary committee seeks to create """"a cemetery-like quiet on campus."""" The university disciplinary committees predate the 1979 revolution. Generally controlled by university administrations, they were created to address purely academic concerns such as cheating or disputes over school credits. However, in some universities, especially outside Tehran, hardliners in the government have pushed the committees to play an intrusive political role. Since the July 1999 protests at Tehran University, the Iranian judiciary and security forces have repeatedly cracked down on student activists. The most recent protests, which spread from university campuses to other parts of major cities during June 2003, were violently suppressed by vigilante groups. On September 29, Gholamreza Zarifian, a deputy science minister in charge of student affairs, reportedly said that only the Ministry of Science, Research and Technology has the power to remove students, and that all judgments made by the committees are subject to review. This came in the wake of a letter from more than 120 members of parliament condemning the disciplinary committees for their treatment of students and for their interference in university life. Human Rights Watch urged the European Union, in its upcoming Human Rights Dialogue with Iran, to call for a moratorium on any further hearings or judgments by the university disciplinary committees regarding non-violent political activism by students.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran",""

The Commission apparently took the measure in reprisal for his campaign to bring to justice the former dictator of Chad, Hissène Habré. With negotiations to re-instate Mr. Guengueng having just broken down, human rights groups called on the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the governments of the Chad Basin region to press for Mr. Guengueng's immediate, unconditional reinstatement. """"Souleymane Guengueng should be honored - not punished - for fighting for justice,"""" said Reed Brody of Human Rights Watch, which last November bestowed Souleymane Guengueng with its highest award. """"We will use all the legal and political means at our disposal to help this brave man get his job back."""" Chadian organizations lauded Mr. Guengueng's struggle and called on the Chadian government to stand up for him. """"Souleymane Guengueng is a national treasure,"""" said Dobian Assingar, president of the Chadian human rights league (LTDH) and vice-president of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH). """"The government of Chad needs to stand up for him."""" Souleymane Guengueng, who almost died of dengue fever during two and a half years of mistreatment in Habré's prisons, founded the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), to record and publicize the atrocities of Habré's regime (1982-1990) and to bring Habré and his accomplices to justice. Habré now lives in exile in Senegal, where he was indicted three years ago on charges of torture and crimes against humanity. Habré's victims are now seeking his extradition from Senegal to stand trial in Belgium. Guengueng and his colleagues have also brought criminal proceedings against Habré's henchmen who remain in powerful positions in Chad. (Background on Mr. Guengueng can be found at https://www.hrw.org/press/2002/11/hrdefender-chad1107.htm) Ever since a Belgian judge visited Chad last year to investigate the charges against Habré, the LCBC has sought to curtail Souleymane Guengueng's struggle for justice. In March 2002, just after the judge's visit, the LCBC suspended Mr. Guengueng for 30 days without pay and threatened him with further sanctions unless he renounced his activities with the AVCRP. On November 14, 2002, the LCBC's director signed a letter dismissing Mr. Guengueng from his position as an archivist. However, the LCBC withheld the letter from Mr. Guengueng until two months later, only days after it secured a $ 2.9 million World Bank contribution on January 22, 2003. When the World Bank made inquiries into the case, it was told by the Commission that Mr. Guengueng had been fired because of a labor dispute. Negotiations to re-instate Mr. Guengueng have just broken down, Brody said. """"The World Bank should not let itself be hoodwinked by the LCBC,"""" said Brody. """"It has the leverage to reverse Souleymane's firing and to stop human rights activists being silenced and bullied on its watch."""" The Lake Chad Basin Commission, which comprises five neighboring states (Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Central African Republic), was established in 1964 to encourage cooperation in developing the Lake Chad region and to attract financial and technical assistance for research. In addition to the World Bank, it is financed by the United Nations Development Program, the African Development Bank, the World Wildlife Fund and the Ramsar Convention Bureau. Mr. Guengueng said that he would not be deterred by the firing. """"I have been tortured, my friends have died in my arms,"""" said Mr. Guengueng. """"Firing me is not going to make me give up the quest for justice."""" Human Rights Watch asked the World Bank to intervene in this case, and the Bank made both formal and informal inquiries with the LCBC before concluding that """"Mr. Guengueng was officially warned in writing several times for extra-curricular activities (which include public statements) deemed incompatible with his status as an international civil servant."""" However, Human Rights Watch noted that international law, the rules governing international civil servants and the LCBC's own Personnel Rules permit and protect the non-political exercise of freedom of expression and association, including Mr. Guengueng's quest for justice for himself and other victims. Background on the Hissène Habré case: Hissène Habré ruled the former French colony of Chad from 1982 until he was deposed in 1990 by current President Idriss Deby and fled to Senegal. His one-party regime, marked by widespread atrocities, was backed by the United States and France. A 1992 truth commission accused Habré's regime of some 40,000 political murders and systematic torture. Habré was indicted in Senegal three years ago on charges of torture and crimes against humanity before the Senegalese courts ruled that he could not be tried there. Habré's victims are now seeking his extradition to stand trial in Belgium, and Senegal has agreed to hold him pending an extradition request. A Belgian judge visited Chad in February and March 2002 to investigate the charges against Habré. In October 2002, the Chadian government formally waived any immunity that Habré might seek to assert. The case against Habré was brought under Belgium's """"universal jurisdiction"""" law that allowed prosecution of the worst atrocities no matter where they were committed. In July, under pressure from the United States, Belgium repealed that law, but the ongoing Habré case was not affected. The Belgian judge is expected to move forward soon with an extradition request for Habré. Guengueng and his colleagues have also brought criminal proceedings against dozens of Habré's henchmen, many of whom are still in positions of power in Chad. The victims face dangers in their quest. The victims' Chadian lawyer, Jacqueline Moudeina, was severely injured in a grenade attack apparently ordered by a Habré-era security official now a police chief, and several victims have been threatened.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/29/uzbekistan-government-blocks-political-meeting","Uzbekistan- Government Blocks Political Meeting","Uzbekistan: Government Blocks Political Meeting","Harassment of Opposition Increasing","09/29/2003","The Uzbek government has effectively blocked the Erk Democratic Party from holding its congress in Tashkent and has increased persecution of the opposition party’s members, Human Rights Watch said today. Government authorities failed to respond to the party’s September 4 request to hold its national meeting on September 27. Atanazar Arifov, the General Secretary of Erk, told Human Rights Watch that without government permission, no venue manager was willing to rent premises to Erk for the meeting, at which more than 400 participants were expected. “Uzbek officials use the rhetoric of rule of law and democracy,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “Yet they refuse to allow an opposition political party to hold a simple meeting.” In its March 2003 country strategy for Uzbekistan, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) called on the Uzbek government to allow for “greater political openness” as one of three political benchmarks on which the bank conditioned its long-term engagement in Uzbekistan. The EBRD held its controversial 2003 annual meeting in Tashkent in May. “Preventing a political gathering flies in the face of the EBRD benchmarks,” said Denber. “The EBRD and shareholder countries should protest the Uzbek government’s actions and urge it to register opposition political parties.” In the lead-up to the Erk congress, officials harassed and threatened Erk members in a clear attempt to dissuade them from attending the congress. In one case, an Erk member in Tashkent was badly beaten. On August 18, two masked men broke into the home of Tashpulat Yuldashev, an Erk member responsible for writing the party’s platform. They beat Yuldashev, causing a concussion and bruising, including a black eye. Yuldashev told Human Rights Watch that since then he and others closely associated with him have been summoned for police questioning about his political activities on several occasions and that he has been under constant surveillance. In August, tax police in Bukhara launched an investigation into the business dealings of Nasrullo Saidov, the head of Erk in that city. Launched two weeks before Saidov was to hold a regional Erk conference, the timing of the investigation suggests it was intended to dissuade him from holding the meeting. The conference was cancelled as a result of the investigation and Saidov is now facing criminal charges that have sprung it. Arifov told Human Rights Watch that the police have telephoned him on several occasions and warned him not to attend the regional Erk conferences that were held in the lead-up to the September congress in Tashkent. Another Erk member, also from Tashkent, told Human Rights Watch that his son was threatened with criminal charges as a warning to his father to stop his political activity. In an earlier incident, police in Chirchik arrested Hasan Kambarov, another Erk member, on March 23, 2003 and held him incommunicado until May 14. According to Kambarov’s relatives, he was tortured in custody through methods that included electric shock and suffocation. Police questioned him about his political activities and asked him to name other Erk members. Police reportedly detained him again on May 22, but they and other authorities denied holding him. Kambarov’s relatives received no news of him until July 15, when a man told them that he had spent several days in a Chirchik police cell with Kambarov in July and that Kambarov appeared to have been beaten. However, the authorities continue to deny that he is in their custody. “Brutal persecution of the political opposition is unfortunately routine here,” said Denber. “Although the government claims to be responding to calls to reduce torture and increase democratic participation, perceived opposition to the government is often met with violence.” The Erk (Freedom) Democratic Party is a political opposition group now effectively banned in Uzbekistan. In the 1991 presidential elections its leader, Mohammed Solih, who is now in exile in Norway, was the only independent candidate ever to challenge Uzbek President Islam Karimov. In November 2000, the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan sentenced Solih in absentia to a 15-year prison term on charges of terrorism and anti-state activities. Human Rights Watch monitored the trial, and found it reminiscent in all respects of Soviet-era show trials. No material evidence of Solih’s guilt was presented. Nine of Solih’s co-defendants also received lengthy terms in prison, and two other men, sentenced in absentia in the same trial, were sentenced to death. Other individuals associated with Erk remain in prison and should be released, Human Rights Watch said. These include Muhammad Bekjanov, Rashid Bekjanov (both brothers of Mohammed Solih), Kobil Dierov, Mamadali Mahmudov, Ne'mat Sharipov, and Iusuf Ruzimuradov.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"

""""The use of secret arrests is a matter of tremendous importance for human rights in the United States and around the world,"""" said Wendy Patten, U. S. Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"Given the Justice Department's refusal to release the names of the detainees, it is up to the Supreme Court to declare that secret arrests have no place in a democracy."""" Human Rights Watch and other advocacy groups sought the release of the names of hundreds of people arrested on immigration and material-witness warrants in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The groups filed their request with the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) in October 2001. The Justice Department denied that request, and plaintiffs filed suit. Yesterday, 21 co-plaintiffs asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review a June decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, ruling that the Justice Department did not have to release the names or other information requested. In a split decision, the appeals court held that all of the information sought was statutorily exempt from disclosure because it was information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and disclosure """"could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings."""" Plaintiffs in the lawsuit, Center for National Security Studies v. Ashcroft, are contesting that decision and are urging the Supreme Court to hear the case both on FOIA and First Amendment grounds. At stake is the public's right to know what actions the government has taken-a guarantee of openness and accountability that is all the more important when the government action involves deprivation of liberty. By cloaking its arrest powers in secrecy, the Bush Administration has prevented the public from judging whether those powers were properly exercised or widely abused. There is mounting evidence that the rights of hundreds of non-citizens were abused in the aftermath of September 11. In August 2002, Human Rights Watch released a 95-page report, entitled Presumption of Guilt, that documents cases of prolonged detention without charge, denial of access to release on bond, interference with the right to counsel, and unduly harsh conditions of confinement. In June 2003, the Justice Department's Inspector General issued a 198-page report with the results of its internal investigation into the treatment of the September 11 detainees held on immigration charges. The Inspector General's report confirmed abuses previously reported by Human Rights Watch, and also identified a pattern of physical and verbal abuse by some correctional staff at a federally run facility in Brooklyn, New York. """"The blanket of secrecy surrounding these detentions has contributed to these abuses,"""" said Patten. """"We urge the Supreme Court to hear this appeal to resolve important constitutional and statutory questions and, in turn, protect the most basic of rights."""" International observers will be watching this case closely. Over the past two years, numerous governments throughout the world have enacted laws that unduly expand government powers of detention and surveillance. Some governments have pointed to the erosion of civil liberties in the United States after September 11 to deflect criticism of their own rights abuses.","United States",""

General Assembly. President Uribe's speech, scheduled for Tuesday, will provide a key opportunity to highlight the ICC's potential for ending impunity, promoting accountability and reaffirming the rule of law.     Human Rights Watch recognizes that Colombia has supported the ICC since its inception. Yet it noted with disappointment that Colombia recently signed an agreement with the United States that effectively grants U.S. citizens in Colombia immunity before the court.     """"Because the war in Colombia has brought atrocities into Colombians' daily lives, President Uribe is in an extraordinary position to speak to the ICC's potential to end the impunity that is so often associated with these crimes,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is appalling that the United States would bully Colombia into signing an unprincipled immunity agreement, and deeply disappointing that President Uribe would yield to this demand.""""     In an effort to pressure states into signing immunity agreements, the United States recently withheld military assistance from 35 countries, including Colombia, that had refused to sign such agreements. Despite this pressure, President Uribe's administration has attempted to justify the signing as consistent with Colombia's obligations to the ICC.     Human Rights Watch believes that the immunity agreement is legally unsound, as no reasonable interpretation of the ICC treaty's provisions allows a state such as the United States to use bilateral agreements to ensure its citizens permanent immunity from the court's jurisdiction. The immunity agreement thus falls far outside the scope of the treaty's Article 98, which envisions bilateral agreements relating specifically to Status of Forces Agreements.     The ICC is the first permanent international court in which those accused of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity may be brought to justice when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so.

Ruslan Sharipov, a journalist and human rights defender who had written widely about government corruption, arrived at the courthouse with a swollen eye, and injury above his eye, and with his glasses broken, raising fears that he was tortured in custody.  “Ruslan Sharipov should have been released,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Instead, the persecution against him continues and he remains at risk of torture and ill-treatment.”  At a closed hearing on September 25, the Tashkent City Court reduced Sharipov’s prison sentence from five and a half to four years. The court upheld the charges of homosexuality (article 120 of the Uzbek criminal code) and sex with a minor (article 128), but dropped the charge of involving minors in “antisocial behavior” (article 127).  Officials attributed Sharipov’s injuries to a minor vehicle accident on the way to court in which Ruslan was the only one injured. On September 17, Sharipov had a letter smuggled out of prison in which he begged Uzbek President Islam Karimov to cancel his appeal due to his strong fears of being both tortured to compel him to repeat his confession in court, and of being ill-treated en route to the court.  Since his arrest on May 29, Sharipov has been at risk of torture and ill-treatment. During the first days of his detention in May, arresting officers threatened Sharipov with physical violence, including rape with a bottle. In a letter smuggled out of prison on September 5, Sharipov said that police officers placed a gas mask over his head, sprayed an unknown substance into his throat and injected an unknown substance into his veins. Sharipov also stated that agents threatened to inject him with the HIV/AIDS virus, and forced him to write his own suicide note. He further stated that other officials threatened physical harassment of his lawyers if he did not dismiss them, and demanded that he ask pardon of the government for spreading “disinformation” about it.  On August 28, approximately a month after Sharipov’s conviction, masked men in camouflaged uniforms kidnapped and severely beat Sharipov’s public defender, Surat Ikramov. The Ministry of Internal Affairs has promised an investigation into this attack but to date has issued no findings.  Sharipov’s defense attorney had requested an adjournment because Sharipov was feeling ill as a result of his injury; the presiding judge declined the request.  “The international community should call on the Uzbek government to release Sharipov immediately, pending an independent inquiry into the case and Sharipov’s treatment,” said Denber. “And it should encourage Uzbekistan to repeal the criminalization of homosexual conduct.”","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","LGBT Rights"

One in 10 has been raped. For women, whose abusers are often corrections officers, the rates of sexual assault are as high as one in four in some facilities. Rodney was 16 and small for his age when he committed a minor crime, setting a Dumpster on fire in an alley. Charged with arson, he was sentenced to an adult prison, where he was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted. Officials ignored his written pleas for help. Prison staff brushed off his mother's attempts to protect her child. Unable to endure a life of constant torture, Rodney hanged himself in January 1996 – 75 days after entering prison. Two months ago, in July, Congress passed a law that could help prevent others from facing sexual abuse behind bars. The Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 won unanimous approval through courageous bipartisan efforts in both the House and Senate. President Bush signed it into law on Sept. 4. This law is desperately needed. Approximately one in five male inmates in the United States has faced forced or pressured sexual contact in custody, according to studies on the subject by researchers such as Cindy Struckman-Johnson at the University of South Dakota. One in 10 has been raped. For women, whose abusers are often corrections officers, the rates of sexual assault are as high as one in four in some facilities. Like Rodney, many victims of rape are young, nonviolent offenders who are inexperienced in the ways of prison life. Like Rodney, many victims have found that corrections officials ignore pleas for help or even retaliate against inmates who file complaints. And like Rodney, many victims have been devastated by the physical and psychological damage they have suffered. Victims of rape behind bars have been left beaten, bloodied and even dead. They have contracted sexually transmissible diseases such as HIV/AIDS and hepatitis A and B. And they have suffered from crippling depression, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress disorder. No one should have to endure sexual violence, especially not in correctional facilities where public officials have near-total control over the lives of those they are charged with protecting. A broad and diverse coalition of civil and human-rights organizations, religious groups and criminal-justice experts support the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 because it is a responsible effort to begin addressing one of the most widely ignored and trivialized abuses of human rights in this country. The act calls for gathering national statistics about the problem, developing standards for states to use to address prison rape, providing grants to support state and local programs to prevent and punish prison rape, and creating a review panel to hold states accountable for making progress. Implemented conscientiously, the Prison Rape Elimination Act will help move us toward a safer, more humane era in American corrections. The act's reach should extend to all detention facilities that confine adults and juveniles, including those that house immigration detainees. The commission that creates the new standards and the review panel that assesses state compliance must be staffed with knowledgeable, experienced reformers. And all those who commit rape must be held accountable for their actions, especially correctional staff who grossly abuse their authority by sexually abusing inmates. Prison rape will not be wiped out with legislation alone. In addition to effective laws, we need mental health services for survivors of abuse, lawsuits aimed at reform and greater compassion on the part of the public. We need to recognize that none of the more than 2 million people now held in U.S. jails and prisons was sentenced to be raped. Addressing this problem will benefit all of us. Sexual assault behind bars spreads disease, promotes cycles of violence, undermines the legitimacy of our justice system, violates basic rights and destroys lives. Rodney deserved better than that. We as a society deserve better, too. _______ **)Stemple is executive director of Stop Prisoner Rape. Patten is U.S. advocacy director of Human Rights Watch.

Bush's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. For President Putin, the Oct. 5 elections are meant to symbolize the final stage of stabilization in the war-torn republic. President Bush shouldn't indulge him in this illusion. Putin clearly wants to turn the page on a war that has taken thousands of lives. Never mind that the Chechen conflict drags on, and that the elections will take place against a backdrop of violence. Never mind that every real competitor of the Kremlin’s favored candidate, Akhmad Kadyrov, withdrew from the race, making the outcome predictable but hardly legitimate. Never mind—as long as Putin’s international counterparts are willing to play along. During his election campaign, Bush called Russia’s operation in Chechnya “not acceptable” and threatened to cut off foreign aid. Now he does not dare even to mention it. Like other leaders, President Bush parrots Russia’s unconvincing mantra about stabilization in Chechnya, and likewise he overlooks last summer’s escalation of violence, egregious human rights abuses by both sides, and the spread of the conflict into the neighboring regions of the North Caucasus. Like other leaders, Bush turns a blind eye to the impact the conflict is having on Russian society. World leaders dare not say anything that might upset President Putin. It’s a phenomenon I cannot understand. In Russia, where I witness the continual violence in Chechnya and now in neighboring Ingushetia too, I struggle to understand how this could possibly be called “normalization,” or how America’s leader can say that promoting democracy and human rights abroad is a priority, and yet completely ignore this bloodshed. In Washington, I meet with officials responsible for defining U.S. policy toward Russia. They must know why their powerful country, so resolute in dealing with human rights abusers all over the world, becomes so timid and indecisive when it comes to its relationship with Russia. U.S. officials are well-informed about the developments in Chechnya and mildly skeptical about Russia’s assurances of normalization. But they are unwilling to make a morally clear statement, let alone to take action. It’s better to wait and see, they say. My question remains unanswered: What exactly they are waiting for, and how many more civilians need to be killed or “disappeared” in order for Washington to raise the issue unequivocally with the Russian president? But it’s not that they are scared, of course—it’s just political expediency, expressed in three main policy arguments. First, they say, the United States has to be patient with Russia because both countries face the common threat of terrorism and Russia’s operation in Chechnya is a contribution to the U.S.-led global war on terror. Wrong. Russia’s abusive campaign only radicalizes originally moderate Chechens and thus fosters the spread of terrorism, rather than the fight against it. Moreover, Washington’s tolerance of this policy hampers alliances with moderate Muslims across the world, which is crucial for the fight against the radicals. The second argument is that raising the issue of Chechnya in public with President Putin only enrages him, while private conversations might eventually make things better. Wrong again. Over the last years, private messages—if there were any—have not prompted any improvements in Chechnya. Or maybe these messages were not taken seriously. As for provoking Putin’s fury by mentioning Chechnya, the Russian president himself was hardly tactful when he excoriated America’s proposed invasion of Iraq, and yet the relationship survived. Maybe President Bush should give it a try. The final argument is straightforward and artless: the United States cannot afford to be tough on Chechnya when Russia’s support is needed on other policy issues. Wrong and unscrupulous. If President Bush wants to demonstrate consistency in his foreign policy, Chechnya should become a precondition, not an obstacle, for a constructive alliance with Russia. Needless to say, Russia has many reasons to be interested in this alliance, no fewer than the United States does. All that’s left, then, is a transcendent fear of a mysterious and unpredictable Russian soul. The problem is, however, that there are more important things to be fearful about. Russia is gradually backsliding on democracy. Developments around Chechnya should not be regarded as a secondary problem in the country’s backyard, but rather recognized as symptoms of alarming trends in Russia—limitations on freedom of the press and freedom of movement, boundless corruption, decay of the military, arbitrariness and brutality in law enforcement, the ascendancy of security forces, and overall neglect of human rights. The less Russian authorities are called to account for these problems in Chechnya, the less they will be likely to care when such abuses happen in other parts of Russia. In this sense, neglecting Chechnya is not just immoral; it’s short-sighted and counterproductive. If the United States wants to build a long-term strategic alliance with Russia, it should see beyond assurances and symbols, and it must clearly state that Russia’s tactics in Chechnya are unacceptable. Constructive criticism is part of any civilized relationship, especially when an allegedly common enemy is being fought. The U.S. president must be able to freely express his concerns about Russia’s problems. Bush shouldn’t fear that Putin may bang his shoe on the podium, instead he should fear the consequences of remaining silent.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Russia",""

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and governments meeting in Geneva next week must take decisive action to eliminate such abuses in refugee settings worldwide. The 77-page Human Rights Watch report, “Trapped by Inequality: Bhutanese Refugee Women in Nepal,” examines the uneven response of UNHCR and the government of Nepal to rape, domestic violence, sexual and physical assault, and trafficking of girls and women from refugee camps. These problems persist despite reforms UNHCR introduced after internal investigations uncovered “sexual exploitation” of refugee women and girls by aid workers in Nepal and West Africa in 2002. Human Rights Watch urged UNHCR and governments participating in UNHCR’s Executive Committee (“ExCom”) meetings from September 29 to October 3 to commit themselves to protecting refugee women. “Refugee women in Nepal are not getting their fair share of aid,” said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. “UNHCR cannot wait any longer to fix policies that put women’s lives at risk. The government of Nepal also has to respond to this urgent problem.” Human Rights Watch called on governments who contribute a substantial portion of UNHCR’s budget to make sure such changes are adopted. UNHCR and governments should ensure that refugee women receive their own registration documents, and that refugee women experiencing domestic violence can find safety. Nepal’s system of refugee registration discriminates against women by distributing rations through male heads of household. This policy denies women equal and independent access to food, shelter and supplies, and imposes particular hardship on women trying to escape abusive marriages. Either these women must stay in violent relationships, leave their relationships (and thus relinquish their full share of aid packages), or marry another man, in which case they lose legal custody of their children. UNHCR has significantly improved reporting systems, staffing levels, legal aid and codes of conduct for aid workers in Nepal, but distressing gaps remain, Human Rights Watch said. Refugee camp management and Nepalese authorities often address domestic violence by promoting “family reconciliation,” and do not adequately address women’s own wishes, safety and access to services. UNHCR has documented 24 suicides in the camps since 2001, four times the suicide rate in the local population. Moreover, 35 refugee women and girls are missing from the camps and may be trafficking victims. The Human Rights Watch report shows how Nepal’s laws constrain the prosecution of gender-based violence. Specific domestic violence legislation does not exist in Nepal. A 35-day statute of limitations and burdensome medical reporting procedures prevent rape victims from filing complaints with the police and pressing criminal charges. The same obstacles have prevented any prosecution of aid workers and Nepalese government employees accused of “sexual exploitation” in October 2002. “Women’s legal status in Nepal and their opportunities for redress against violence are abysmal,” said Jefferson. “UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies should advocate for legislative changes in Nepal.” After reports of “sexual exploitation” by refugee aid workers in 2002, UNHCR removed three international staffers in Nepal on grounds of gross negligence. UNHCR should promote transparency and set a standard of accountability for its staff and partners by providing information on the disciplinary measures it has taken. UNHCR and donors should also increase pressure on Nepal and Bhutan to resolve their longstanding refugee situation in a manner that is timely and meets international standards. Over 100,000 Bhutanese refugees have been living in seven camps in southeastern Nepal ever since they were arbitrarily stripped of their citizenship and forced to flee Bhutan in the early 1990s. Bhutan and Nepal meet this week in New York to discuss a recent refugee screening that deemed only 2.5% of those considered eligible for repatriation to Bhutan with full citizenship, leaving the rest to an uncertain and potentially stateless future. The process failed to meet international standards, and excluded women from meaningful participation. Cases of Bhutanese refugee women featured in the report: (Pseudonyms are used to protect privacy) Geeta M. told Human Rights Watch that her husband frequently beat her and threatened to deny her food and other rations. “Sometimes I was beaten so badly I bled. My husband took a second wife. I didn’t agree. He said, ‘If you don’t allow me to take a second wife, then the ration card is in my name, and I’ll take everything.’ I have asked my husband for the health card and ration card and they don’t give it to me. I have not gotten approval to get a separate ration card.” One refugee woman, Durga S., told Human Rights Watch, “My husband is suspicious whenever I talk to anybody else. Since he brought a second wife, I am beaten frequently. On my thighs, there were blue marks. He had beaten me with a belt and with his hands. He has already hit me, why should I show everyone? People will talk badly about us. My husband threatens to kill me and throw me away. He beats me if he thinks I’m reporting it to someone.”","Asia, Bhutan, Nepal","Children's Rights, Attacks on Education"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/24/broken-promises-liberia","Broken Promises To Liberia","Broken Promises To Liberia","","09/24/2003","Ravaged by a civil war that has claimed more than 200,000 lives, Liberia had its moment in the spotlight this summer. President Bush, on his way to Africa, pledged that America would """"help the people of Liberia find the path to peace."""" Two thousand U.S. Marines steamed for Liberia's shores. And on Aug. 15, after the departure of Liberia's brutal leader, Charles Taylor, a """"vanguard"""" force of 200 Americans landed in Monrovia, raising hopes among Liberians that the United States would aid them at last.   But just 10 days later, with much less fanfare, the Marines withdrew to their ships, leaving an ill-equipped and undermanned West African force in Liberia's capital. Liberia began its return to obscurity, but not yet its return to peace.   Many Liberians and Africans have drawn cynical conclusions from this episode about the Bush administration's commitment to their continent. As they see it, the United States sent its forces 99 percent of the way to Liberia -- close enough to claim credit for acting, but not so close as to assume risk or responsibility.   The administration's approach is probably not so calculated. Rather, it appears to be the product of another messy compromise between Secretary of State Colin Powell's generous definition of America's global interests and the Pentagon's narrower view. But as with many such compromises, the effect is the worst of all possible worlds: U.S. troops remain off Liberia's coast, near enough to be tarnished by failure but too far away to ensure success.   The administration's defense is that the situation in Liberia is stabilizing and that U.S. forces are no longer needed. Indeed, despite their limitations, West African peacekeepers have managed to bring some calm and hope where they have deployed -- in Monrovia, the town of Kakata and, just last week, the port of Buchanan. The problem is that peacekeepers have barely moved outside these cities to the countryside, where most Liberians live and die.   Last Friday the U.N. Security Council approved a larger mission, but that force is expected to take three or four months to deploy to Liberia. Meanwhile, in most of the country, Liberia's armed factions are seizing what they see as their last chance to loot. Armed bands continue to murder, rape and recruit children into their ranks. Thousands of people remain in hiding in the bush, where food, water, shelter and medical care are scarce or nonexistent. Fighting between rebels and government forces and continuing raids by all sides on civilians are driving more people from their homes.   In fact, reports of violence in villages outside Monrovia have increased since peacekeepers were deployed in the capital, which pushed government militias to the city's outskirts. Moreover, with no security, important parts of the country remain no-go for humanitarian workers.   A more robust U.S. military deployment would not have ended all this misery, but it would have made a difference. A significant U.S. presence in Monrovia would have had a profound psychological effect on Liberians and the leaders of the armed factions. It would have enabled West African peacekeepers to deploy outside the capital, where they are most needed. It would have made recruiting more forces from other countries easier. And even token demonstrations of U.S. power in the countryside might have increased confidence and calm.   It's not too late for the United States to redeem its promise to Liberia. The administration should be seeking funds from Congress to support the country's reconstruction, including the rebuilding of its judicial and law enforcement institutions. It should back a strong U.N. peacekeeping force with an explicit mandate to protect civilians, and a mechanism for holding accountable those responsible for past atrocities. It should seek Charles Taylor's extradition from Nigeria, where he has taken refuge, to the Sierra Leone Special Court, which has indicted him for war crimes. Just like Saddam Hussein, Taylor needs to be apprehended and prosecuted, so that his people know he will never return or destabilize their country again.   Nor is it too late to send those Marines back into Monrovia. Such a deployment would still save lives. It would still send a message the administration should be desperately eager to send: that America is willing to use its immense power not simply for narrow self-interest but for the benefit of others. What Africa needs from President Bush is a real commitment to nation-building. Nation-visiting is no substitute.","Africa, United States, Liberia, US Foreign Policy",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/23/children-war-colombia","Children at War in Colombia","Children at War in Colombia","","09/23/2003","By Joanne Mariner, Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division   Published in FindLaw.com    September 29, 2003     When Paula Calderón was fourteen, her mother died. A few weeks after the funeral, Paula’s father brought her to a guerrilla outpost in the jungle. “He told me that he had a debt with them,” she said when I interviewed her last year, “and that he had to hand me over in exchange.”   Paula ended up spending a year and a half with the Cimarones Resistance Front of the National Liberation Army, known as the ELN. Some 200 guerrillas belonged to her unit, the large majority of whom were teenagers like her. “The youngest were around eleven years old,” she remembered, “but most were age 14, 15, or so.”     All of the irregular armed forces in Colombia’s decades-old war -- left-wing guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries -- send child soldiers of Paula’s age into combat. When I met Paula at the government rehabilitation center where she lived, she showed me how her stomach was a mass of gruesome scars, the result of having been shot during fighting with paramilitaries. The nurse who was treating her said that Paula was lucky to be alive, since the wound had become infected due to improper medical treatment.     Because underage combatants fill the ranks of both guerrilla and paramilitary groups, many of the dead and wounded in the armed conflict are children. And even those who are unscathed physically are likely to bear psychological scars.     To exploit children in this way is not simply cruel, it is a war crime.    One of Every Four Combatants Under Age 18     At least one of every four irregular combatants in Colombia is under eighteen years of age. According to a new report by Human Rights Watch, the total number of child combatants in Colombia likely exceeds 11,000. The youngest join up at age seven or eight, while most are recruited as young adolescents, at age twelve or thirteen.     Unlike Paula, most child soldiers in Colombia are not forced into joining. Still, the intense pressures they often face and lack of opportunities in their lives undercut the idea that they join voluntarily.     Most are from desperately poor backgrounds, with little chance of education, personal advancement, or status. Many were abandoned by their parents or farmed out to relatives. Some are victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse. Frequently, by the time they enter their teens, they have left school and are working at menial, poorly-paid jobs.     “When I was twelve, a cousin raped me,” one girl told me, explaining why she left home for the guerrillas. “I was so angry, I wanted vengeance. I wanted to hurt everyone who had hurt me.”    Killing, Mutilation and Torture     Once these children enter a guerrilla or paramilitary group, they lose whatever tenuous claim they may have had on childhood. The life of children in these forces is very much like that of adults, with little accommodation made for their age.     Trained to use modern assault rifles from the age of eleven, young recruits march for days on end with little food. Many die or are wounded in battles with government soldiers backed by helicopters and heavy artillery.     And it is not just on the battlefield that these children see death. Besides taking part in combat, they are also expected to take part in the atrocities that are a hallmark of the Colombian conflict. Human Rights Watch interviewed former child soldiers who, as trainees, were forced to watch captives being tortured and mutilated. Others were made to shoot unarmed prisoners as a test of valor. Still others were ordered to execute comrades -- even friends - who were captured while trying to run away.    The Use of Child Soldiers is a War Crime     By sending children into battle, guerrillas and paramilitaries are committing war crimes. Under Protocol II to the Geneva Conventions, groups fighting an internal armed conflict are prohibited from recruiting children under the age of fifteen, or allowing them to take part in hostilities. The Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), ratified by all U.N. member states except for the United States and Somalia, also establishes fifteen as the minimum permissible age for military recruitment.     Because the CRC’s general definition of a child is any person under the age of eighteen, its rule on the age for military recruitment is an anomaly. The Optional Protocol to the Convention, which came into force last year, corrected this difference. It prohibits the compulsory military recruitment of anyone younger than eighteen and bars irregular armed groups from recruiting under-eighteen-year-olds or using them in combat.    Lost Years     “Four lost years,” said Jorge, a sixteen-year-old boy, when I asked him to sum up his experiences in the paramilitaries. “Four years of seeing friends die.”     Too many number of children have fought and died in Colombia. If the adults who are responsible for the war are not willing to end it, they should at least do the fighting themselves.","Americas, Colombia","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

On September 18, U.S. army troops opened fire on an Associated Press (AP) reporter and photographer in the town of Khaldiya, 50 miles west of Baghdad. No one was injured, but the photographer's car was badly damaged. On August 17, U.S. forces shot and killed a Reuters television cameraman, Mazen Dana, outside the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. According to the military, they mistook his camera for a rocket-propelled grenade (RPG). U.S. military authorities told Human Rights Watch on September 23 that they investigated that incident and concluded that the soldiers had acted within the rules of engagement. Dana was the 12th journalist killed in action in Iraq since the beginning of the war in March, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists. Five of these deaths were from U.S. fire. """"As attacks against them continue, U.S. soldiers are sometimes resorting to deadly force in a reckless and indiscriminate way,"""" said Joe Stork, acting executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa Division. """"This puts all civilians, not just journalists, at grave risk."""" Stork pointed out that, as the occupying power in Iraq, the United States is obligated to ensure public safety in a manner that conforms to international humanitarian law and human rights standards. This obligation includes a requirement to avoid disproportionate harm to civilians. In the most recent incident, AP photographer Karim Kadhim and his driver Qassim al-Saidi were traveling to Baghdad when they heard about an attack on U.S. forces at Khaldiya, where the Iraqi police chief had been assassinated a few days earlier. When they arrived, they saw a U.S. tank blocking the road. In the front window of their car was a white laminated sign with black letters, three feet long, that read: """"PRESS."""" At that moment, they heard an explosion, which they believed to be an RPG attack on the U.S. troops. According to the driver, Qassim al-Saidi, a U.S. tank then trained its machine gun on his car. He told Human Rights Watch: """"When we arrived, we saw the tank and stopped. We heard another RPG at that moment, and that is when they shot with a machine gun from the tank. … We turned around quickly, opened the doors, and jumped out. All the bullets hit the car and some went through the seats. … The Americans were very nervous and frightened. They are very confused and suspicious of everything."""" The two men hid by the side of the road and eventually found refuge in nearby houses. According to an AP report on the incident, a 20-year-old man was shot in the chest and taken away in a taxi. In the same incident, AP correspondent Tarek al-Issawi, who had arrived in another car, was fired upon by a .50-caliber machine gun on a U.S. tank, the AP reported. Mr. al-Issawi was also unharmed. Human Rights Watch inspected Mr. al-Saidi's car, a dark blue Chevrolet Caprice Classic with Baghdad plates 322616. There were seven bullet marks on the car, some of which had penetrated inside the vehicle. The tires were flat, and the windshield was blown out. According to the AP, the car was hit """"about 20 times."""" U.S. military said soldiers had come under attack that day in Khaldiya. A roadside bomb reportedly exploded near a convoy, and gunmen then opened fire on U.S. troops. A second attack took place nine miles to the west. Two soldiers were wounded but it is not clear in which attack. The AP sent a letter of protest to U.S. military authorities in Baghdad, asking for an investigation. The shootings were unwarranted and put journalists in grave danger, the AP said. Human Rights Watch also spoke with Ghaith `Abd al-Ahad, an Iraqi national who works as a news assistant for the New York Times. He told Human Rights Watch that U.S. soldiers threw him to the ground, and handcuffed and verbally abused him. According to `Abd al-Ahad, around September 1 he was driving on Highway 1, 20 miles north of Baghdad, when he came upon a U.S. military checkpoint. An explosion had just killed one U.S. soldier and injured another, and `Abd al-Ahad saw a helicopter evacuating the wounded. Two U.S. soldiers, whom `Abd al-Ahad believes were from the 4th Infantry Division, pushed him roughly to the ground, even though he showed his press card and said he worked for the New York Times. He was soon let go. As he stood 50 meters away watching the scene, the same two soldiers approached him, threw him to the ground again, cuffed his hands, and put a bag over his head. """"One of the soldiers had his knee on my neck,"""" `Abd al-Ahad said. """"When I said I work for the New York Times he said, 'Oh, so you speak English,' and he pushed his knee down harder."""" Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that reckless reactions by U.S. troops to hostile fire are putting civilians at risk, in this case journalists. It called for an investigation into the September 18 attack on the AP journalists.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/23/human-rights-watch-commentary-dutch-asylum-policy","Human Rights Watch Commentary on Dutch Asylum Policy","Human Rights Watch Commentary on Dutch Asylum Policy","Presented on the occasion of the Parliamentary Roundtable Discussion called by the Permanent Commission on Justice","09/23/2003","Introduction   Human Rights Watch is a privately funded international non-governmental organization dedicated to monitoring human rights conditions throughout the world and advocating policies to curb abuse. Our researchers regularly monitor human rights conditions in some seventy countries in all parts of the world.   In the past four years, our work in Western Europe has focused on the treatment of migrants and asylum seekers, resulting in in-depth research, reporting, and advocacy in Greece, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and the U.K. This research has revealed a wide range of issues of concern in Western Europe, including arbitrary and prolonged detention, substandard detention conditions, inadequate protections for victims of trafficking, police abuse suffered by migrants and asylum seekers, inadequate asylum procedures, and deprivation of migrants' fundamental economic social and cultural rights, such as housing, food, and education. We have also found that children are particularly vulnerable to many of these violations.   Throughout the region, we have encountered governments preoccupied with developing ever more restrictive asylum and immigration policies and disinterested in addressing the violations we have identified. Against this backdrop, we are particularly pleased with the dialogue that we have developed with the Dutch government. We very much appreciate the Dutch parliament's interest in our work and we thank you for the opportunity to discuss our findings with you today.   In April 2003 Human Rights Watch released a report entitled Fleeting Refuge: The Triumph of Efficiency Over Protection in Dutch Asylum Policy. Based on three months of in-depth research, the report details the ways in which the current Dutch asylum policy and practice violate fundamental asylum and refugee rights. Using illustrative case examples in combination with an analysis of national and international law and policy, the report highlights three primary areas of concern: violation of refugee and asylum rights in the accelerated asylum determination procedure (""""AC procedure""""); inappropriate treatment of migrant and asylum-seeking children; and restrictions on asylum seekers' rights to basic material support, such as food and housing.   In response to a request by the permanent commission of justice of the Dutch parliament, the former Minister of Immigration and Integration, Mr. Hilbrand Nawijn, formally responded to Human Rights Watch's findings and recommendations in a letter dated 20 May 2003. Given the significance of this response in terms of reflecting the government's perspective on the issues we raised and its willingness to take steps to address those concerns, Human Rights Watch's contribution to this parliamentary roundtable discussion focuses on the Minister's response.   Mr. Nawijn's response to the Human Rights Watch report was disappointing in a number of respects. As a general rule, his response simply reiterated the theoretical and procedural foundations of Dutch asylum law, emphasizing the process by which it has been enacted and its approval by Dutch courts. Unfortunately, this response ignores Human Rights Watch's findings that some aspects of Dutch law and policyBeither on their face or in practiceBviolate human rights standards articulated by international bodies.   Mr. Nawijn notes, for example, on the first page of the reply, that the law came into being after consultation between the government and parliament and is supported by an independent judicial review opportunity, which utilizes the same international and regional standards highlighted in the Human Rights Watch report. Neither the purity of the legislative process nor the opportunity for judicial oversight guarantees that the practice of the law or even in some cases the law itself are in conformity with a State's international legal obligations.   The Human Rights Watch report specifically highlights a number of real-life cases in which Dutch law and policy has violated international standards. It outlines other cases in which otherwise adequate law and policy has not been implemented as might be expected, and thus in breach of refugee and asylum seekers' rights. Yet, nowhere in the Minister's response are these case examples addressed, nor has there been any indication that IND intends to further investigate these or other examples that clearly reveal a divergence between Dutch policy and practice and governing international standards.   As mentioned at the outset, Human Rights Watch identified shortcomings in three aspects of Dutch asylum policy and practice-the AC procedure; the treatment of child migrants and asylum seekers; and reception conditions for certain categories of asylum seekers. In our presentation today, we would like to briefly identify the inadequacies of the Minister's assertions that the Netherlands is meeting its international obligations to protect the rights of migrants and asylum seekers in each of these areas.   AC Procedure   The Minister describes the accelerated AC procedure as a mechanism for quickly filtering out manifestly unfounded asylum claims. In its report, Human Rights Watch expressed concern that in practice the AC procedure is used to process cases that require a longer, more deliberate process. We urged IND to develop clear guidelines to ensure that it is used only in appropriate cases.   The Minister resists this recommendation, arguing that no particular guidelines are required for the AC procedure because it is no different from the regular asylum procedure, just faster. In practice, however, as detailed in the Human Rights Watch report, there has been a great deal of confusion and debate over exactly what the AC procedure is and for whom it was intended-resulting in its application in cases that are clearly inappropriate for such swift, cursory review. On the basis of its review of dozens of case records, Human Rights Watch has concluded that cases involving complex legal and factual questions should always be transferred to the full asylum procedure and that this should be clearly spelled out in IND guidelines. The types of cases for which the AC procedure should be clearly specified as always inappropriate include those involving the application of the six-month trauma guideline, questions of """"internal flight options,"""" and other complex interpretative questions, such as whether persecution as a member of a """"social group"""" occurred. These types of cases should always be transferred to the full asylum determination procedure. In addition, cases involving psychological, as well as physical, problems or trauma at the time of the interview or that reveal possible torture or sexual violence should be exempted from accelerated consideration.   The Minister defends the AC procedure on the grounds that such speedy decision-making reduces the period of uncertainty suffered by asylum seekers. It is indeed in the best interests of asylum seekers to have certainty on their legal status without the years-long delays experienced by many asylum seekers under the former asylum policy. Nonetheless, Human Rights Watch is concerned that in shifting to processing a majority of asylum cases in a mere three and one-half days, IND has gone too far in the opposite direction.   The Minister's assertion that the AC procedure gives asylum seekers a full and fair opportunity to explain their reasons for seeking asylum is unresponsive to the real-life examples Human Rights Watch and other groups have identified, in which asylum seekers have faced significant obstacles to obtaining meaningful counsel, documenting their need for protection, or effectively challenging a negative decision on appeal.   The Minister indicates that the specific issue of access to legal counsel will be addressed more closely in an evaluation of the AC procedure being conducted by the IND. Human Rights Watch looks forward to continued dialogue on this issue once the results of that evaluation are made available. We would encourage the commission to seek regular, independent evaluations of the AC procedure and other policy issues highlighted in Human Rights Watch's report.   Treatment of Migrant and Asylum-Seeking Children   The Minister's response to our findings of abuses of migrant and asylum-seeking children raises three specific concerns.   The first is his insistence that the Convention on the Rights of the Child is inapplicable to certain migrant children present in the Netherlands. Human Rights Watch reiterates that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has consistently stressed that in acceding to the Convention, states commit themselves to protect all children within their borders, without discrimination. That the Convention's applicability could lead to difficult choices is hardly a justification for alleviating the Dutch government of its obligations.   Human Rights Watch is further concerned by the Minister's response to our findings regarding interviews of migrant and asylum-seeking children. We welcome the decision to halt interviews of children aged four and five, but we are concerned that continuing interviews of children aged six and older fails to address the many real-life problems with child interviews identified in the Human Rights Watch report. Citing """"major organizational and financial consequences,"""" the Minister also rejected Human Rights Watch's recommendation that children each receive a single guardian to accompany them to all interviews and otherwise follow them throughout the procedure. The Convention on the Rights of the Child's best interests of the child standard is paramount in all proceedings affecting children and cannot simply be ignored because of organizational or financial consequences. It is critical that the Ministry urgently address these concerns in consultation with VluchtelingenWerk, SRA, and NIDOS.   Thirdly the Minister's response to our findings about child migrants and asylum seekers fails to address abuses stemming from the definition of """"accompanied"""" children employed by the Dutch government. As detailed in the Human Rights Watch report, in practice this policy has the effect of leaving the care of children to adult relatives resident in the Netherlands, without regard to whether they are willing or able to meet the child's needs or whether this assignment of responsibility is in the best interests of the child. It is hoped that these gaps in the Minister's response will be filled in by the evaluation of the minors policy mentioned in his response.   Reception Conditions   Regarding the issue of whether asylum seekers whose claims have been denied in an accelerated procedure should have access to basic material support pending an appeal, Human Rights Watch would encourage the Ministry and parliament to further consider the meaning of an effective appeal and the character of the AC procedure. Particularly given the problems with the AC procedure identified above, an effective appeal procedure is critically important to the Dutch government's adherence to the non-refoulement principle, ensuring that it never returns an asylum seeker to a country in which his or her life or freedom are at risk. Human Rights Watch has identified cases in which the lack of inadequate reception conditions rendered it difficult or impossible for asylum seekers to pursue a meritorious appeal. We believe that the Netherlands' commitment to the principle of non-refoulement dictates review of this policy.   Conclusion   In sum, the Minister's response to Human Rights Watch's report does little to seriously address the concerns and recommendations we outline in that report. We welcome this roundtable discussion and look forward to other parliamentary efforts to reinvigorate the debate over the AC procedure, including material reception issues and Dutch policy regarding the treatment of migrant and asylum-seeking children. We hope that our report can inform this debate, in particular focusing policy-makers attention on the practical effect of existing policies and pointing to areas in which practice diverges from policy intent.   This initiative is particularly important as the Dutch government anticipates its 2004 presidency of the European Union, which will offer it an important opportunity to ensure that asylum policy promulgated at the E.U. level fosters European-wide compliance with international standards. We hope that the Dutch government will seize this opportunity not only to improve its own asylum policy, but also to extend its humanitarian tradition to the broader European community.","Europe/Central Asia, Netherlands",""

Azerbaijan’s presidential elections are scheduled for October 15. In a letter to President George W. Bush, Human Rights Watch urged the administration to call upon Azerbaijani Prime Minister Ilham Aliev, son of current President Heidar Aliev, to ensure balanced election commissions and election monitoring by local rights groups. “So far the Azerbaijani government has thoroughly manipulated the electoral process,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Taken together with the government’s attempts to intimidate opposition party workers and activists, it would appear that the government is trying to achieve a dynastic secession without a free and fair vote.” In the run-up to the election, local human rights groups have documented dozens of instances of government harassment, intimidation and arbitrary arrests of journalists and opposition party activists. Police have beaten or detained hundreds of demonstrators who are protesting the government’s handling of the elections. The government also manipulated the election law to stack election commissions in favor of pro-government candidates, harassed opposition party activists and journalists, and maintained a policy that prohibits election monitoring by domestic groups that receive more than 30 percent of their funding from foreign sources. The Central Election Commission refused to register as candidates Rasul Guliev, the former speaker of the parliament, and Eldar Namazov, a former presidential aide who is now president of the Public Forum for Azerbaijan. The state-dominated local broadcast media overwhelmingly gives coverage to the pro-government candidates, and the government has attempted to intimidate independent or opposition print media from criticizing the government. “Azerbaijan has an abysmal record on elections,” said Denber. “The United States and others should demand a free and fair vote.” The last national election—the 2000 parliamentary vote—was one of the most fraudulent ever observed in post-Soviet Azerbaijan. Groups monitoring the election, including Human Rights Watch, found many instances of ballot-box stuffing, fraudulent vote tallying, bullying of local election commission members who represented the opposition, and other violations. In its letter to President Bush, Human Rights Watch noted that the Azerbaijani public has interpreted recent statements by the U.S. administration on Azerbaijan as favoring the Alievs. Azerbaijan’s vast oil wealth has not translated to improvements in the standard of living for the population, half of which, according to the government, lives below the poverty line of U.S. $25.80 per month. The country ranks as among the most corrupt, at 95th out of 102 countries, in Transparency International's most recent Corruption Perceptions Index. In the past year, an increasing number of public demonstrations protested against corruption and poor public services.","Europe/Central Asia, Azerbaijan",""

Bush meets with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan on Tuesday, he should commit the United States to withdrawing financial support and arms deliveries to regional warlords and military commanders responsible for human rights violations, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to President Bush today.   In a separate letter, Human Rights Watch urged President Karzai to announce his support for provisions in the new Afghan constitution that will protect the human rights of all persons in Afghanistan, with special emphasis on women and on religious and ethnic minorities, and to initiate an investigation into alleged threats made recently by senior government officials and others against the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC). """"President Karzai should ask the United States once and for all to end the supply of arms and money to the warlords who are destabilizing Afghanistan and intimidating Afghans throughout the country,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"President Bush should encourage President Karzai to do everything in his power to ensure that the new constitution protects women's rights and religious freedom while creating a judiciary that will ensure those rights have meaning in real life and are not just nice words on paper."""" Since leading the military effort to remove the Taliban from power in 2001, the United States has attempted to support the government in Kabul while providing arms and money to regional warlords and military commanders who have joined the continuing fight against Taliban remnants and al-Qaeda. In a series of reports, Human Rights Watch has documented systematic rights violations by gunmen under the warlords' command and the deteriorating security situation that has ensued. These developments have called into question many of the gains made since the ouster of the Taliban. """"It is crucial that the United States immediately end its unsuccessful policy of supporting the national government and regional warlords at the same time, as this policy has been both destabilizing and contributed to human rights abuses,"""" said Adams. """"President Bush should order the Departments of State and Defense and United States intelligence agencies to implement this policy consistently and in a coordinated manner."""" In its letter to President Karzai, Human Rights Watch urged him to make human rights the centerpiece of his administration. """"While President Karzai faces a very complicated political situation, it is crucial that he speak in a clear and consistent voice in favor of press freedom, the rights of women, and the safety of human rights defenders,"""" said Adams. Human Rights Watch requested President Karzai to """"take all measures within your legal and moral authority to ensure that those political or military figures responsible for human rights abuses do not hijack the constitutional drafting process to intimidate delegates, legitimize their own positions, or limit the rights of women and religious and ethnic minorities."""" Human Rights Watch also urged both President Bush and President Karzai to press for the expansion of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the international peacekeeping force currently stationed only in and around the capital, Kabul. Human Rights Watch also called on the United States to offer the logistical, intelligence, and political support needed to make it happen. """"Improved security, which only an expanded ISAF can deliver in the immediate future, is necessary for a credible constitution-drafting process and national elections scheduled for next year,"""" said Adams. When President Karzai spoke to the U.S. Senate on February 26, 2003, he rejected the need for the expansion of ISAF and suggested that a reconstituted Afghan army could provide security for the country's citizens.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/22/uzbekistan-neighborhood-committees-violate-rights","Uzbekistan- Neighborhood Committees Violate Rights","Uzbekistan: Neighborhood Committees Violate Rights","","09/22/2003","Uzbekistan’s neighborhood committees violate fundamental human rights, carrying the government's repressive policies to the local level, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today. The 38-page report, """"From House to House: Abuses by Mahalla Committees"""" documents the role neighborhood, or mahalla, committees have played in three critical areas of government abuse: the government's six-year campaign against so-called Islamic fundamentalists, its response to domestic violence, and the 2000-2001 forced resettlement in southern Uzbekistan. For centuries, the mahalla was an autonomous institution organized around Islamic rituals and social events, but the current government transformed it into a national system for surveillance and control. Uzbekistan is divided up into approximately 12,000 mahallas, each containing between 150 and 1,500 households. The mahalla committees are local government authorities with the power to administer a range of activities. """"Mahalla committees may appear to be a benign form of local self-government, but in reality the government uses these committees to keep tight control over its population,"""" said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Mahallas are the eyes and ears of the government, passing on all they observe to the police."""" President Islam Karimov declared 2003 the “Year of the Mahalla,” reflecting the government’s intent to expand the powers of mahalla committees. By keeping files on those considered “overly pious” in their religious expression, carrying out surveillance, and reporting people’s “suspicious” religious activity to police, mahalla committees assist the government in its crackdown against peaceful, independent Muslims who practice Islam outside government-controlled religious institutions. They also organize and participate in public denunciations at which pious Muslims are abused, threatened and demonized. Mahalla committees enforce government policy to prevent divorce at the expense of women’s rights to protection from domestic violence. Serving as a gatekeeper to law enforcement and the courts, mahalla committees frequently deny battered wives access to both, deny them permission to divorce, and hold women responsible for violence they face in the home. Human Rights Watch documented cases where mahalla committees coerced women to remain in abusive marriages that threatened women's safety and mental health. Between August 2000 and March 2001, mahalla committees also participated in the Uzbek government's forced resettlement programs in southern Uzbekistan, following incursions by Islamic militants against the government. People were forced from their homes and relocated to resettlement villages where they were cut off from interaction with the general community and deprived of any means of livelihood. Mahalla committees joined the military and other authorities in the intimidating and violent tactics that characterized the forced displacement. They also sought to prevent people who were living in abysmal conditions in resettlement centers from meeting with independent human rights monitors. Human Rights Watch called on the government to ensure that mahalla committees stop discrimination and surveillance of independent Muslims; provide in-depth training of mahalla officials on the provision of protection to complainants in domestic violence cases; and facilitate, rather than block, access for international organizations and the media to resettlement villages. Human Rights Watch further called on international donors to require reform of mahalla committees as a condition for funding projects involving the committees. """"Donors need to be very careful before putting money into institutions like mahalla committees,"""" said Denber. """"Otherwise, they could end up supporting the very abuses that they are trying to help overcome."""" Examples of abuses by mahalla committees: On June 5, Akhmadjon Madmarov, a human rights activist whose three sons were in prison for the expression of their Muslim faith, was asked to meet with a procurator at the office of the mahalla committee in Margilan, in the Fergana Valley. When Madmarov arrived, he faced a “commission” made up of police, procurators, and mahalla committee members. The commission showed him an official warning letter, stating that if he participated in further protests, he would be charged with a crime. A procurator at the meeting demanded that he sign the letter. Madmarov refused, stating that he had not participated in any protests, but that he had observed a protest against the treatment of religious prisoners several days earlier in his capacity as a human rights defender. “The procurator told me to sign the warning letter. I refused and said that I haven’t breached anything. He said, ‘Okay, the commission will write in the minutes that you refused to sign.’ I asked for a copy of the letter. They refused to give it to me.” “Lola L.” endured twenty-six years of violence in her marriage, which resulted in a punctured lung and a related chronic illness. She had turned to local mahalla committee leaders many times before making her latest appeal to a newly installed mahalla committee chairwoman. “We have a tradition that when you come with a complaint, two or three days go by and they promise to help, and then they start to persuade you to forgive him and to stay,” she recounted. “I came to the previous chairman three times, and after two or three days they start to persuade you to go back.”  Mahalla committee members used the promise of compensation as a tactic to facilitate the arrest of displaced people suspected of collusion with Islamic insurgents in southern Uzbekistan. Arbob Sherkholov and Shakhizinda Rajabov, from Uzun district, were arrested from the Istiklol resettlement village. Oista Sherkholova, Sherkholov’s wife and Rajabov’s sister, told Human Rights Watch: On December 13, 2000, at 4:00 p.m., a policeman and the chairman of the Sherobod mahalla arrived at our house in a police car. They said to Arbob and Shakhizinda, “we would like to give you land and compensation money, come to Sherobod for discussions now, then you can come home in three days.” …. I waited for fifteen days, then I went with twelve other women to Termez, and along with the other women I found my husband’s name on the list of prisoners in Termez prison.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

The 28-page report, Spreading Despair: Russian Abuses in Ingushetia, documents arbitrary arrest and detention, ill treatment, and looting by Russian forces in Ingushetia this summer. The report charges that these abuses are among the tactics Russian authorities are using to pressure displaced persons living in Ingushetia to return to Chechnya. Human Rights Watch questioned the Bush administration’s hands-off stance on Russian rights abuses in Chechnya since the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. The Bush-Putin summit will take place on the eve of the October 5 presidential elections in Chechnya, part of the Kremlin’s efforts to demonstrate that the situation there is returning to normal. However, the elections will be held amid escalating violence and human rights violations. “The United States and Russia may be partners in the global campaign against terrorism, but they should not be partners in abuse,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “President Bush should not squander the opportunity to send a strong message to President Putin to end the violations and protect displaced persons from abuses, and ensure that no one is coerced into returning to Chechnya.” The report details seven security operations federal and local forces conducted in June 2003 in settlements for displaced persons, as well as in Ingush villages. The operations followed a pattern of sweep operations or targeted raids seen in Chechnya: large groups of armed personnel, often arriving on armored personnel carriers, would surround a settlement and conduct sweeps or random checks at peoples’ homes. In those security operations, at least eighteen people were arbitrarily detained; most of whom were not released until several days or weeks later, without ever receiving an explanation of the grounds for their detention. In other operations, federal forces appear to be responsible for killing one civilian and seriously injuring two others. Russian authorities use other tactics to compel the approximately 84,000 displaced persons remaining in Ingushetia--particularly the 12,000 in tent camps-- to return to Chechnya. These include threats of arrest, arbitrary deregistration from camp lists and interruption of infrastructure services. In recent days, local authorities seemed set on closing one of the five remaining camps, Bella camp, by forcing residents to move to another camp. They have intermittently denied access for humanitarian and human rights groups to the camps. “Pressuring displaced people and spreading abuses in Ingushetia is all part of the same strategy—to move the Chechnya problem inside Chechnya and block outside scrutiny,” said Denber. “President Bush should reject the illusion of ‘normalization’ and seek public commitments from President Putin on human rights improvements.” Human Rights Watch recommended that President Bush seek commitments regarding protection for displaced persons, accountability for abuse and access to the conflict zone. These recommendations include: No displaced person should be involuntarily returned to Chechnya, including by indirect means, such as threats, arrests, harassment or curtailment of humanitarian assistance in Ingushetia.

In a submission to the U.K. House of Lords Select Committee on European Union Affairs, the group raised concerns about the U.K. proposals to process asylum claims and shelter refugees in centers located outside U.K. territory. The submission references Human Rights Watch’s detailed research in numerous countries where refugees and asylum seekers held in such “protection centers” have suffered egregious abuses, including beatings, arbitrary arrest and detention, rape, and return to countries where their lives or freedom were threatened. Human Rights Watch has found such violations to occur even when international organizations such as the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) are involved in administering them. """"The U.K. government seems to think human rights are optional in immigration policy,"""" said Julia Hall, senior researcher on Western Europe for Human Rights Watch. """"But all the governments in the EU need to remember their obligations under international law. Immigration policy has to do more than just keep migrants out."""" The European Commission, UNHCR, and nongovernmental organizations have expressed concern that the United Kingdom is seeking to shift responsibility for refugees to other, often poorer countries. They caution that the U.K. proposals could undermine the right to seek asylum and the right to be protected against return to an unsafe place. UNHCR’s Executive Committee, which is made up of U.N. member states and sets international refugee policy, is meeting in Geneva next week. The Committee has recently been attempting to clarify refugee protection norms in light of the U.K. proposals and the increasingly restrictive asylum policies of many of the E.U. member states. Human Rights Watch said the latest U.K. proposals present a new challenge to established international refugee protection norms. “For years we have seen ever more restrictive policies toward asylum seekers in EU member states,” Hall said. “Now, the strategy seems to be shifting toward preventing asylum seekers from coming into the EU at all. It’s a policy of simply turning a blind eye and hoping the problem will go away.” The Lords review of the external processing proposals comes on the heels of a September 2003 Tory proposal to establish a quota system and process asylum seekers who make it to the United Kingdom on sparsely populated British offshore islands that offer “no prospects for economic advancement.” At EU-level, the current Italian Presidency is focusing largely on external border control. One of the Italian Presidency’s pet projects, known as Project Neptune, aims to coordinate sea patrols to intercept migrants at sea before they reach EU territory.","Europe/Central Asia, United Kingdom","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"

Extending the administrative detention, which is set to expire on September 23, will undermine possibilities for reform under Malaysia's new government. The nine detainees have all been held without charge or trial since August 2001. Under the ISA, the government may hold individuals indefinitely, without having to present evidence of their alleged crimes in court. Most of the nine detainees are members of the opposition Parti Islam SeMalaysia (PAS). The government has alleged that they have connections with the Kumpulan Mujahidin Malaysia (KMM), which it accuses of militant Islamic activity. """"If the government decides to continue detaining these men, that would highlight everything that is wrong with the ISA in Malaysia,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Because of the secrecy of the process, no one outside the Malaysian security services knows what evidence there is against them. The government needs to give the detainees their day in court or release them."""" There are indications that the arrests were politically motivated to weaken PAS. Among the nine detainees are Nik Adli, a PAS member and the son of senior PAS cleric Nik Aziz; PAS youth wing leader Noorashid Sakip; and PAS youth committee member Mohd. Lothfi Ariffin. The arrests came at a time when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's popularity was declining and PAS was on the rise. In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, and the Bali and Marriott hotel bombings in Indonesia, the Malaysian government has used the specter of terrorism to justify its continued use of the ISA. Since 1960, Prime Minister Mahathir and his predecessors have used the ISA to silence political opponents, human rights advocates and others. Under the act, the government can detain persons indefinitely without trial and limit an attorney's access to a client. Judicial review of decisions taken under the ISA are severely limited; appeals are handled by a notoriously weak advisory board, which may only make recommendations, and lacks the power to order the release of individuals who have been wrongly detained. Over the past two years, the government has detained numerous alleged militants under the ISA. Roughly 100 individuals are now being held for their alleged ties to militant groups, including both KMM and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), according to government sources. There are allegations of abuses against some of the detainees, including ill treatment while in custody and coercion during questioning. """"While there may well be some people in custody with ties to violent groups, they should be given a fair trial under Malaysia's criminal law, instead of disappearing into the black hole of the ISA,"""" said Adams. """"If Prime Minister Mahathir wants Malaysia to be a developed country by 2020, as he has said, he should not bequeath a draconian colonial era law to his successor."""" Human Rights Watch urged Home Minister Abdullah Badawi, the Prime Minister-designate, to intervene in these cases and demonstrate that he is committed to making Malaysia a country that takes the rule of law seriously. """"The incoming prime minister needs to recognize the grave shortcomings of the ISA and begin the process of getting rid of it,"""" said Adams. """"Malaysia won't be able to make progress on human rights and the rule of law until the ISA is repealed.""""","Asia, Malaysia",""

The Human Rights Watch briefing paper, Aceh Under Martial Law: Unnecessary and Dangerous Restrictions on International Humanitarian Access, documents recent bureaucratic restrictions that bar international humanitarian agencies from providing direct aid to the province. Megawati will speak before the United Nations General Assembly on September 23, 2003, about anti-terrorism efforts underway in Indonesia. Human Rights Watch urged the Secretary General of the United Nations, as well as member states, to remind Megawati of her obligations to allow humanitarian relief to reach civilians in Aceh. """"The international community should not allow the Indonesian government to use legitimate concerns about terrorism in Indonesia to deflect attention from equally legitimate concerns about the current crisis in Aceh,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"Access to Aceh should be at the top of the international agenda with President Megawati."""" The briefing paper warned that without outside assistance, local authorities may not be able to distribute food and supplies or protect vulnerable groups, such as children separated from their parents, victims of trauma, the elderly, or pregnant women. Indonesia also may be unable to provide water and sanitation facilities in camps for civilians forced to flee their homes due to the fighting. In the past, Indonesia has relied heavily on international humanitarian agencies and the United Nations to provide support during humanitarian crises, but it has severely restricted those groups from Aceh since the government launched a major military campaign against the separatist Free Aceh Movement (GAM) on May 19. """"The Indonesian government should not be blocking humanitarian assistance at this critical juncture,"""" said Adams. """"The people of Aceh could be facing a real disaster behind closed doors. It is time for Indonesia to open up the province to outside observers and to let humanitarian agencies do their work."""" The ongoing offensive in Aceh is Indonesia's largest military campaign since it invaded East Timor in 1975. The operation in Aceh involves an estimated 30,000 troops. Opposing them are an estimated five thousand armed members of GAM. Recent fighting between the Indonesian military and GAM, including attacks on food convoys, has cut supplies of food and water, and disrupted electricity, communications and health care services. Early warning signs of a humanitarian crisis have come by way of Indonesian media sources and humanitarian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), who have noted malnutrition and a shortage of water and sanitation facilities among thousands of civilians who have fled their homes during the fighting. Human Rights Watch also urged the United Nations to continue to press Indonesia for an independent assessment of the needs of Aceh's civilians and to ensure they are provided with necessary assistance. In the briefing paper, Human Rights Watch urged the government of Indonesia to: Provide immediate and unimpeded access throughout Aceh for all impartial humanitarian agencies to distribute and monitor aid. Facilitate, rather then impede, the movement of humanitarian workers in the province. End the requirement that humanitarian aid be routed through the Indonesian authorities, and permit impartial humanitarian agencies to deliver aid directly to populations in need. Allow access to U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations that can assist in the protection of civilians, particularly displaced persons. Act to prevent attacks on humanitarian agencies and their workers, and take appropriate action against those implicated in such attacks.","Asia, Indonesia",""

In a letter to President Jim Wolfensohn, Human Rights Watch called on the World Bank to champion an international convention for the protection of migrants that recently entered into force.  The Migrant Workers Convention guarantees migrants' human rights and promises state protection against abuse by employers, agents and public officials. The convention has been ratified by 22 states, but has yet to be adopted by many wealthy countries that depend heavily on migrant labor. """"The World Bank knows that migrants are key to economic development, but they're not paying attention to the dark side of that issue,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"The Bank should be leading the way in international efforts to protect them from exploitation and abuse."""" Nearly ten million foreigners, most of them unskilled or semi-skilled migrants, work in Gulf states. Migrants comprise some 90 percent of the 1.7 million workers in the United Arab Emirates, where the World Bank will hold its meetings. Remittances sent home by migrant workers reached $80 billion in 2002, up from $60 billion in 1998. These payments have become more important sources of finance for developing countries than private lending or official development assistance. In 2001, these payments were worth $10 billion to India, $6 billion to the Philippines and more than $2 billion to Bangladesh, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco. Despite their value to both their home countries and the societies in which they work, many migrant workers suffer from discrimination, exploitation and abuse. Migrants, including large numbers of women employed as domestic servants, face intimidation and violence, including sexual assault, at the hands of employers, supervisors, sponsors and police and security forces. Children are especially vulnerable to labor and sexual exploitation and denial of basic rights. """"Thousands of children are trafficked to the United Arab Emirates for use as beggars and camel jockeys,"""" Mungoven said. """"The World Bank can't claim to fight child labor in poor countries and then turn a blind eye when it crosses borders."""" Sponsors and employers often confiscate migrants' documents, including passports and residence permits, restricting their freedom of movement and ability to report mistreatment. Migrants in the Gulf states typically can't obtain an exit visa without the approval of their sponsor or employer, sometimes placing them in situations that amount to forced labor. Migrants in undocumented or """"irregular"""" situations are often indebted to traffickers, and have little choice but to work under highly exploitative conditions . Documented migrants can easily slip into illegal status when unscrupulous employers and sponsors deliberately let residence permits expire, or literally sell workers to other employers, thereby invalidating their work permits. Human Rights Watch called on the World Bank to encourage states that send or receive migrants to adopt and implement the protections contained in the Migrant Workers Convention. The Bank could help governments regulate migration and employment agencies to combat trafficking, exploitation and abuse.

Substantive progress is urgently needed if Mexico is to carry out the human rights agenda articulated in Fox's recent state of the union address.  """"President Fox continues to say the right things when it comes to human rights,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But his words need to be matched by concrete actions."""" In his September 1 address to Mexico's Congress, President Fox reiterated his commitment to the principal initiatives of his human rights agenda: the Special Prosecutor's Office, which was set up to investigate human rights violations against government opponents, and a collaboration with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, which is expected to assess Mexico's human rights problems and lay the groundwork for a national human rights program. """"Today both of these initiatives are facing difficulties,"""" Human Rights Watch's letter said. A recent Human Rights Watch report, Justice in Jeopardy, showed how the Special Prosecutor's Office has been seriously undermined by a lack of resources, limited access to declassified documents and a lack of cooperation by the military. In addition, the Special Prosecutor's Office faces legal hurdles that could drastically limit its ability to prosecute cases. The collaborative effort with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner, meanwhile, has been undermined by the National Human Rights Commission, which has refused to participate in the process. The Commission's resistance has met with almost complete silence from the Fox administration. Concrete steps will need to be taken once the assessment is complete to ensure that its findings are widely disseminated and discussed within Mexico, and that its recommendations are incorporated into a comprehensive and effective national human rights program. """"The success or failure of the Special Prosecutor's Office and the collaborative effort with the United Nations will largely determine your government's human rights record,"""" the letter to President Fox asserted. To ensure success of the president's human rights agenda, Fox should make it """"emphatically clear to the institutions of the state, and the public at large, that these two initiatives are central to your human rights agenda, and that this agenda is a top priority of your presidency."""" Human Rights Watch urged Fox to issue a presidential directive instructing all state functionaries to respond promptly and thoroughly to requests for information from the Special Prosecutor's Office. Such a directive is essential to ensuring that the military does a better job of providing information to the special prosecutor. Other steps needed to shore up the work of the Special Prosecutor's Office include:   improving access to declassified documents by indexing the archives and ensuring that they are not managed by officials with potential links to the people under investigation; convening a commission of distinguished jurists to examine the legal issues that may impede prosecution and develop a consensus of how best to overcome them; and providing the office with additional personnel, as well as with funding to cover essential equipment and training.

Both guerrilla and paramilitary forces rely on child combatants, who have committed atrocities and are even made to execute other children who try to desert. The first comprehensive report published on this issue, """"You'll Learn Not to Cry: Child Combatants in Colombia,"""" documents how Colombia's illegal armies have recruited increasing numbers of children in recent years. Only Burma (Myanmar) and the Democratic Republic of Congo are believed to have significantly larger numbers of child combatants than Colombia. """"By relying on children to fight, guerrillas and paramilitaries are doing incalculable damage to Colombian society,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These children will bear the scars of their experience for decades to come."""" Eighty percent of the children under arms belong to one of the two guerrilla groups, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) or the National Liberation Army (ELN). At least one of every four irregular combatants in Colombia is under eighteen years of age. Of these, several thousand are under the age of fifteen, the minimum age permitted for recruitment under the Geneva Conventions. """"Sending any child under eighteen to fight and be killed is reprehensible, and the use of child combatants under fifteen is a war crime,"""" said Vivanco. """"Under no circumstances should the government offer guerrillas or paramilitaries immunity from prosecution for this heinous conduct."""" The 150-page book, based on interviews with 112 former child combatants, documents how both guerrillas and paramilitaries exploit the desperation of poor children in rural combat zones. Many join up for food or physical protection, to escape domestic violence, or because of promises of money. Some are coerced to join at gunpoint, or join out of fear. Others are street children with nowhere to go. Children as young as thirteen are trained to use assault rifles, grenades and mortars. Some are even younger. Bernardo, a boy who was conscripted into a paramilitary group, told Human Rights Watch how children are trained to be killers. """"They teach you bit by bit, first with a .38 [handgun] and then with a bigger weapon,"""" Bernardo said. """"I was shooting at posts with an AK-47 before I was eight."""" Youngsters in paramilitary groups told Human Rights Watch that their training included watching prisoners being mutilated with knives or chainsaws. """"They'd kill three or four people each day in the [training] course. Different squads would take turns, would have to do it on different days,"""" said Óscar, a former paramilitary. More than a quarter of the children interviewed Human Rights Watch are girls, most of them from the FARC. They told us that many male commanders use their power to form sexual liaisons with underage girls. Girls as young as twelve are required to use contraception, and must have abortions if they become pregnant. On both sides, children who try to escape and return to their families risk execution. Guerrilla """"war councils"""" vote by a show of hands whether erring combatants should be put to death. In some cases, both victims and executioners are children. """"You have to do it because it's an order,"""" said Elizabeth, a young fighter in the FARC. """"There had been a war council and I had voted no. The commander told me, 'Since you voted no, you will be the one to kill him.'"""" Colombian armed forces and police do not recruit children under eighteen, and the recruitment of minors is punishable by six to ten years in prison. Yet the government has failed to protect children by enforcing the law energetically. """"The Colombian government should make the demobilization of children from guerrilla and paramilitary forces, and an end to their further recruitment, a priority item in any future negotiations with these forces,"""" said Vivanco. Human Rights Watch urged guerrilla and paramilitary forces to end all recruitment of children under the age of eighteen and to demobilize the children in their ranks. Pending complete demobilization, the group urged the following immediate and unconditional steps: firmly prohibit forcible recruitment; allow those who wish to leave without reprisals; cease executions of children; and provide proper medical care for the sick or wounded. The United States should urge that the demobilization of children be made a top priority in future negotiations with paramilitaries and guerrillas, Human Rights Watch said.","Americas, Colombia","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

Thich Tri Luc, a member of the banned Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam (UBCV), is expected to be tried under Article 91 of Vietnam's Penal Code on charges of fleeing abroad in order to oppose the Vietnamese government. If found guilty, he could face life imprisonment. Vietnamese officials had previously denied any knowledge of the monk's whereabouts after his disappearance from Cambodia in July 2002. His family did not know whether he was dead or alive until last month. Last week, however, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry told reporters that Thich Tri Luc was arrested in July 2002 at the Cambodia-Vietnam border. """"The case of Thich Tri Luc highlights so many of the abuses that the Vietnamese government routinely commits,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Harsh repression of a religious believer, the apparent abduction and incommunicado detention of a peaceful dissident, and complicity in violation of international refugee law are all part of a broader pattern in Vietnam. These practices must stop."""" Thich Tri Luc fled from Vietnam to Cambodia in April 2002 to seek asylum after suffering years of persecution by the Vietnamese authorities. He was granted refugee status by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in June 2002. On 25 July 2002 the monk """"disappeared"""" after being escorted by an unidentified man from the guesthouse where he was staying in the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have called for an explanation from the Cambodian authorities as to how a refugee was apprehended and returned to Vietnam, the country from which he had fled persecution. """"Returning a refugee to a country where he faces persecution is a serious violation of the Refugee Convention,"""" said Adams. Cambodia is a state party to the convention. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch called on the Vietnamese authorities to allow Thich Tri Luc immediate access to his family, a lawyer of his choice, and United Nations officials. He is currently detained at a pre-trial detention center in Ho Chi Minh City. """"Apparent abduction from Cambodia by Vietnamese authorities and incommunicado detention of a Buddhist monk who has been recognized as a refugee is a new low for Vietnam's so-called justice system,"""" said Ingrid Massage, director of Amnesty International's Asia and Pacific Program. """"What happened to Thich Tri Luc shows Vietnam's flagrant contempt for the United Nations and international standards of justice. He should be immediately released."""" Thich Tri Luc (secular name Pham Van Tuong), 49, has been a Buddhist monk for more than thirty years, and actively affiliated with the UBCV since 1992. He was persecuted, arrested, imprisoned, and placed under """"pagoda arrest"""" in Vietnam during much of the last decade. He was first detained without trial and placed under indefinite house arrest in Vietnam in 1992 during a government crackdown against the UBCV for protesting against the treatment of Buddhists and calling for respect of religious freedom. In November 1994, Thich Tri Luc was arrested again after he assisted in a UBCV flood relief effort in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. After a closed trial in Ho Chi Minh City in August 1995, he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison and five years probationary detention (a form of house arrest). The trial led to widespread protests from governments and international organizations around the world. Thich Tri Luc was adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, and the European Parliament passed a resolution calling for his immediate release and that of three other UBCV monks sentenced at the same time. After Thich Tri Luc's release from prison in 1997, he was placed under house arrest in Ho Chi Minh City. He was required to report monthly to the security police, restricted from traveling, barred from residing in his own pagoda, and stripped of other rights as a citizen. When his five-year probationary period ended in February 2002, the official surveillance and persecution of Thich Tri Luc continued. Two months later he fled to Cambodia to seek political asylum. In a letter to Human Rights Watch in June 2002, Thich Tri Luc wrote: """"I have described the difficulties and mistreatment I endured under the Communist government. It became clear to me that there was no way for me to continue living in Vietnam. My rights and daily way of living were being trampled by the authorities. I knew I must flee across the border. With difficulty I was able to cross to a neighboring country on April 19, 2002. I was fortunate to make it to Cambodia, seeking freedom, whereas in Vietnam I was forced to live without safety under the harsh regime."""" """"I appeal to the superior monks of the UBCV and all monks and nuns in my country and overseas, as well as the international human rights organizations and the United Nations, to intervene and help me to obtain approval as a refugee.

Despite several thousand marines offshore, however, Washington has still not made a real commitment to solving Liberia's crisis.   If people knew more about how those Liberians on the embassy doorstep were killed, they might also understand how limited U.S. action has been so far, and what Washington still needs to do. Peacekeepers alone won't solve the problem.   The dead were civilians killed in indiscriminate rebel shelling in late July. Dozens of mortar rounds fell on a compound across from the U.S. Embassy, where thousands of civilians had taken shelter. Scores of civilians died and over 2,000 people were wounded by mortars and stray bullets in the attack.   Where did the rebels get the mortar rounds? In late June, troops from the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) ran out of ammunition and were forced to abandon an offensive in Monrovia. Three weeks later, resupplied with ammunition, including 81- and 82-millimeter mortar rounds, LURD attacked again. Their bombardment led to many of the casualties around the U.S. Embassy.   The LURD mortars very likely came through neighboring Guinea, a recipient of U.S. military aid. Human Rights Watch documented LURD's links to Guinea last year and called on Guinea and the United States to hold LURD accountable for its abusive conduct of war. This spring, a UN panel of experts, which had also linked Guinea and LURD, reported suspicions that flights into Guinea for a mining company carried weapons that were later transported to LURD by sea and land   Belatedly, the U.S. government called on Guinea to cease its support for the LURD. But Guinea has thus far evaded international condemnation for its record in fuelling the Liberian conflict.   Côte d'Ivoire has played a similar role arming the other Liberian rebel group, Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL). Witnesses have told Human Rights Watch that the Ivoirian government recruited fighters for its own conflict with the promise that they could """"keep their arms and take them back to Liberia to fight Taylor."""" Toulepleu, a town in the west of Côte d'Ivoire, has proved an ideal base for the Movement for Democracy to launch attacks into Liberia.   Charles Taylor's government in Liberia relied on help from across the border, too. The Liberian government is under UN sanctions, but counted on regional allies such as Burkina Faso to help cover up its illegal arms imports. Regular night flights to Monrovia's Robertsfield International Airport continued through early August.   The LURD and MODEL rebels profit from the regional and international antipathy to Charles Taylor, who fomented instability and human rights abuses across West Africa and earned an indictment on war crimes in Sierra Leone before being forced into exile in Nigeria last month. Taylor's militias regularly recruited children, tortured, raped and summarily executed civilians in Liberia.   The West African intervention has brought some stability to Monrovia, but the regional force remains too small to deploy outside the capital in significant numbers. Meanwhile, all three warring parties - the government militias, LURD and MODEL - have continued to rape, loot and displace civilians in the rural areas. This despite Taylor's departure and arrangements for an interim government to take power in Monrovia next month.   Liberia urgently needs more peacekeepers. But West Africa as a whole needs sustained and skillful diplomacy just as badly. The continuing war in Liberia is a regional war, and the United States has lost many opportunities to engage West African governments in ways that might have lessened the suffering this war has caused. The Bush administration should not lose any more chances.","Africa, United States, Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, US Foreign Policy","Arms"

Eritrea's practice of arbitrary arrests and detentions continues to this day. """"Eritreans, who struggled valiantly to become free and independent, deserve to have their human rights respected,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Unfortunately, the government continues to deny them that opportunity."""" On September 18, 2001, the Eritrean government arrested eleven leaders of the ruling party after they sent a letter to President Issayas Afewerki calling for democratic reforms, including the implementation of the 1997 constitution. In the roundup that followed, publishers, editors, and reporters were arrested, and all non-government newspapers and magazines were closed down. In the two years since, the government has arrested scores more, either because of their ties to the dissidents or their perceived political views. President Issayas has referred to the detainees as """"traitors"""" and """"spies,"""" but formal charges have not been filed. To detain people for more than thirty days without charges is a violation of Eritrean law. Arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention without trial has not been limited to politicians and journalists. In late 2002, the government detained 250 refugees who attempted to flee Eritrea after being involuntarily repatriated from Malta. The refugees have been held incommunicado ever since. Religious minorities are also subject to persecution. Members of Pentecostal Christian churches and Jehovah's Witnesses are frequently arrested for practicing their faiths.

Action Needed to End Rights Abuses","","09/15/2003","Liberian government forces and rebel fighters are committing grave human rights abuses while peacekeeping forces remain inadequate, Human Rights Watch said today in a briefing paper. A U.N. peacekeeping force of 15,000 has been proposed for deployment in October, but it could take months for the force to reach full capacity. Despite assurances by U.S. forces and the West African peacekeeping force known as ECOMIL that the situation in Liberia has stabilized, marauding armed bands continue to commit murder, rape, forced recruitment and looting. Ragtag government militias and fighters from both rebel groups--Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) and the splinter group of ex-LURD members called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL)--operate with little discipline or command control, and loot partly because they are hungry and not being paid. """"Government and rebel fighters continue to terrorize and abuse civilians in Liberia,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Africa Division. """"This is a critical moment for immediate U.N. action in Liberia."""" Hundreds of thousands of persons are being uprooted repeatedly as they flee from the countryside in terror and fear of these armed groups, which are seeking to secure the last spoils of battle before the territory can be secured by peacekeepers. Soldiers systematically extort money and other goods from those seeking refuge and block them from moving to safety. Fleeing civilians also fall victim to rape and abduction by the armed groups. Thousands of people remain in hiding in the bush, where adequate food, water, shelter and medical care are scarce or non-existent. Most of the population remains in grave need of basic necessities, particularly outside the capital, Monrovia. Rape and other sexual violence against girls and women remain pervasive, and are committed by all sides in the conflict. Sexual violence often accompanies the widespread looting, and women and girls who resist providing sexual services risk being shot by the armed fighters. In northern Bong County, rape of young boys is reportedly on the rise. Rape and other forms of sexual violence have also been reported in centers for displaced persons in Monrovia, particularly where conditions are crowded, and food and other necessities must be found outside the camp. Both the government militias and rebel fighters rely on child soldiers. Most are between thirteen and sixteen years old, but some child soldiers are as young as six years of age. Many have been forcibly recruited. Some of these child soldiers had fought in the 1990-97 war and were demobilized, only to be re-recruited with the renewal of fighting in 2000. The fewer than 3,000 West African peacekeepers currently deployed in Liberia remain woefully inadequate. The signing of a comprehensive peace agreement on August 18 included a pact between the government and rebel forces to grant access throughout the country to humanitarian workers and organizations. However, the persistent insecurity continues to impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in greatest need. Protection of the civilian population is an urgent priority. All sectors of Liberian society, from civilians and civil society groups to fighters from all the warring parties, have repeatedly called for a prompt and more expansive deployment of ECOMIL and other international forces. Human Rights Watch calls on the Security Council to deploy the proposed U.N. peacekeeping force of 15,000 to Liberia as soon as possible in order to protect civilians, to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance, to establish conditions for the safe and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons, and to support disarmament and demobilization efforts.","Africa, Liberia",""

Among them are men the United States has identified as terrorists for their willingness to massacre Colombian civilians. Washington's response should be unequivocal. If Colombia is serious about human rights and wants to continue receiving millions in aid, it cannot allow known criminals to escape justice by, in effect, writing a check. Currently, Colombia receives the third-largest amount of U.S. military aid, after Israel and Egypt, and is slated to receive more than $700 million in 2004. This is how Colombia's peace commissioner described the bill in an interview: """"Rather than serving time in a prison, there are alternative sentences, and the individuals will be allowed to pay reparations."""" The size of these """"reparations"""" has not been determined. But many suspect it will be mere pocket change for paramilitaries leaders, many of whom are known to have accumulated vast riches through criminal acts. Not only are the men who would benefit among the most ruthless killers in the world, but Colombian and American authorities agree that paramilitary leaders are often indistinguishable from drug traffickers. Instead of using drug profits to bankroll lavish lifestyles, they use them to fuel war. Colombian intelligence sources estimate that paramilitaries control 40% of the country's cocaine exports. They have attacked and killed Colombian prosecutors and police officers as well as presidential candidates, Congress members and mayors. In September 2002, the U.S. sought the extradition of paramilitary chieftain Carlos Castano -- who would be eligible for this program --and two others for importing cocaine into the U.S. Castano's record is instructive of the crimes at stake. As of this year, Colombia's judiciary had sentenced him to 102 years in prison for massacres, assassinations and torture. But he has never served a day behind bars. One conviction was for organizing a 1997 massacre in the hamlet of Mapiripan. At dawn, his paramilitary group rounded up locals and took them to a slaughterhouse. The armed group bound and tortured the captives, then slit their throats. The first person killed was hung from a meat hook. At least two bodies were later found decapitated. More than 30 others perished. Far from denying a role, Castano claimed responsibility and promised """"many more Mapiripans"""" in the future. Mapiripan is just one of the reasons the U.S. State Department put Castano's paramilitary on the list of foreign terrorist organizations. The prospect of checkbook impunity evokes disturbing memories. In 1984, Colombia's most brutal drug traffickers, led by Pablo Escobar, offered to turn over their billion-dollar assets to Colombia in exchange for immunity from prosecution and extradition to the U.S. The deal fell through after public outcry. This deal would be far worse. It would amount to letting crimes against humanity and drug trafficking go unpunished if the perpetrators, in effect, wrote a check. There are powerful practical arguments against checkbook impunity. Impunity does not promote peace. It erodes the rule of law and encourages further violence. In Colombia, the history is stark. The Castano family entered a similar arrangement in 1992, agreeing to bankroll the transition of a small, murderous guerrilla group to peaceful pursuits. Through a family-run """"charity,"""" the Castanos funneled million of dollars worth of land and cash to the former guerrillas to set up small businesses, schools and training programs. Where did the money come from? Before going legit, Fidel, the eldest Castano brother, was a Medellin Cartel heavy. As a strategy for peace, the arrangement was an utter failure. Only two years after the guerrillas surrendered, many of them turned up as Carlos Castano's fighters. By the 1990s, political violence had reached unprecedented levels. In 2001, prosecutors charged the family """"charity"""" with financing paramilitaries. Atrocities should mean prison. If Castano is extradited, U.S. prosecutors should not ignore his human rights crimes. There should be no offer to let him testify against his trafficker colleagues, then vanish into a witness protection program. If paramilitaries fail to agree to the government's terms, the Colombian armed forces -- which the U.S. has spent more than $2 billion to remake -- should track them down and the government should bring them to justice. To do otherwise only means that Colombia's war will yet again reemerge, more devastating than before.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

ALP has also been on the frontlines of the battle for the right of people with AIDS in South Africa to have access to antiretroviral drugs. “ALP has steadfastly fought the irrationality of the South African government’s stance on drugs for AIDS, and it has helped create a movement that will eventually win this struggle,” said Jurgens. The AIDS Law Project co-founded the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), chaired by Zackie Achmat, a former ALP director. ALP and TAC led a coalition that took the South African government to court in 2002, which led to a ruling that requires the provision of antiretroviral drugs to pregnant women for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. TAC and ALP are also lead players in the grassroots movement that led to the recent announcement by the South African government that it would roll out an antiretroviral treatment plan after years of resisting the very idea of treatment for AIDS. ALP has spearheaded communications efforts to inform the South African public of its rights with respect to HIV/AIDS. It has provided leadership on policy and legislation related to discrimination against people with AIDS, to protection of women and children from sexual violence, and to protection from mandatory HIV testing, among many other issues. It has also provided technical assistance on these and many other human rights issues to activists all over Africa. “ALP’s outstanding leadership addresses both the AIDS epidemic and the epidemic of human rights abuse that fuels AIDS in Africa,” said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS Program at Human Rights Watch. “ALP won’t rest until people with AIDS in South Africa and those at risk can live in dignity.” Dr. Wan Yanhai, recipient of last year's international award at the time he was detained by the Chinese government, as well as Stephen Lewis, the UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, will participate in the awards ceremony in Montreal on September 12.

In a year full of encouraging progress in the battle against antipersonnel mines, other highlights included a marked decrease in use of the weapon around the globe, and a sharp increase in funding for mine clearance. The 826-page Landmine Monitor Report 2003: Toward a Mine-Free World documents compliance with the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, as well as progress and problems in eradicating antipersonnel mines in all countries. Human Rights Watch gave the United States a mixed review in the Landmine Monitor Report 2003. Human Rights Watch is a founding member of the ICBL, and coordinates the Landmine Monitor initiative as well as contributing the chapter on the United States. """"We're pleased with the degree of progress around the world this year,"""" said Stephen Goose, executive director of the Arms Division at Human Rights Watch. """"But the United States could speed this progress if it showed more leadership on the landmine issue."""" A total of 136 nations have ratified the treaty, which comprehensively prohibits the use, production, stockpiling and transfer of antipersonnel mines. Another 12 countries have signed but not yet ratified. In this Landmine Monitor reporting period (since May 2002), at least six governments used antipersonnel mines, all non-signatories to the ban treaty: India, Iraq, Myanmar (Burma), Nepal, Pakistan, and Russia. This is a decrease from at least nine governments identified in Landmine Monitor Report 2002 and at least 13 governments in Landmine Monitor Report 2001. Armed opposition groups used antipersonnel mines in eleven countries, compared to fourteen the previous year. In Afghanistan and Iraq, thirty-one U.S. soldiers were killed or injured by landmines and unexploded ordnance in 2002 and the first five months of 2003. The United States apparently did not use antipersonnel mines in the Iraq conflict, although it deployed more than 90,000 mines to the Persian Gulf region for possible use in Iraq. While the United States has apparently not laid new mines in the Afghanistan conflict, Human Rights Watch has discovered that U.S. forces are using minefields from the Soviet era as part of their perimeter defense at some locations in Afghanistan. The United States remained the largest donor to international mine clearance programs, at $76.9 million in its fiscal year 2002. However, this sum represented a decrease of nearly $5 million from the previous year, and nearly $24 million over the last two years. The Bush Administration has yet to conclude the review of U.S. landmine policy begun in June 2001. """"The Bush Administration cannot seem to decide if it wants to play a leadership role in ridding the world of antipersonnel mines, or to reverse the progress of the past decade,"""" said Goose. """"U.S. participation in the Mine Ban Treaty would make a significant difference in securing the support of other non-signatories."""" Ten countries have joined since the last annual report, including Afghanistan, one of the most mine-affected countries in the world. Belarus, with the world's sixth largest stockpile of antipersonnel mines (4.5 million), joined most recently, on September 3, 2003. According to the report, more than 52 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines have been destroyed by 69 states, including four million in the past year. For 2002, Landmine Monitor identified $309 million in mine action funding by more than 23 donors, a 30 percent increase from the previous year. Globally, funding for mine clearance has totaled over $1.7 billion since 1992, including $1.2 billion since the Mine Ban Treaty was opened for signature in 1997. Among the report's most disturbing findings were: Use of antipersonnel mines by the forces of Saddam Hussein in the lead-up to and during the 2003 conflict in Iraq. This was the only government to be added to the list of mine users compared to the previous year. Greatly expanded use of antipersonnel mines by both government and rebel forces in Nepal, as well as the first admission by the government that it has produced mines. However, both sides stopped using mines following the January 2003 cease-fire. Greatly expanded use of antipersonnel mines by guerrilla and paramilitary forces in Colombia, resulting in a sharp increase in civilian casualties. The decision by Turkmenistan, a party to the Mine Ban Treaty, to keep 69,200 antipersonnel mines for training purposes. This should be considered a violation of the treaty, which permits retention only of """"the minimum number absolutely necessary"""" for training purposes. Most states that have decided to retain training mines are keeping hundreds or a few thousand. Encouraging developments among those not yet party to the Mine Ban Treaty include: Greece and Turkey completed all the domestic procedures to join the treaty and their foreign ministers affirmed that their countries would submit simultaneously their respective instruments of adherence. The parliament of Serbia and Montenegro passed legislation to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty on 20 June 2003. In Burundi, a draft law for ratification of the Mine Ban Treaty was adopted by the Council of Ministers in March 2003 and by the Senate in June 2003. In Sudan, in May 2003, Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail announced that the Council of Ministers had officially and unanimously endorsed the Mine Ban Treaty and had transmitted it to Parliament for ratification. Russia surprisingly revealed that it destroyed 16.8 million stockpiled antipersonnel mines from 1996-2002. Previously it had only reported destruction of 1 million mines. In November 2002, Russia also stated for the first time that for the past eight years it has not produced or supplied to its troops PMN or PFM type mines, particularly deadly mines which have been responsible for innumerable civilian casualties around the world in recent decades. Ukraine destroyed 405,000 antipersonnel mines between July 2002 and May 2003.  A number of countries formally extended or reconfirmed their moratoria on exports of antipersonnel mines, including China, Israel, Poland, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Turkey and the United States. Latvia and Poland submitted voluntary transparency reports consistent with Article 7 of the Mine Ban Treaty as an indicator of their commitment to join eventually. China significantly increased its contributions to international mine action programs. Landmine Monitor Report 2003 is the ICBL's fifth annual report. Human Rights Watch, a privately-funded international monitoring group based in New York, coordinates the Landmine Monitor initiative and serves as chief editor for the annual report.

The paper was issued to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the military coup that overthrew the government of Salvador Allende on September 11, 1973. Some 350 military and police officials implicated in human rights violations under the government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet (1973-1990) are now facing criminal charges. Many are being held in detention pending trial. Among the defendants are twenty-two generals, and forty colonels and lieutenant colonels.     """"The thirtieth anniversary of the military coup comes at a time when hopes are high that justice will finally be achieved in Chile,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. """"The Chilean courts deserve great credit for the advances they have made in criminal prosecutions. Now the government must give them the tools they need to bring to trial those responsible for the terrible crimes of the Pinochet era.""""     Until Pinochet's 1998 arrest in London, most human rights crimes committed during military rule were not prosecuted in Chile. Officials were shielded from justice by a 1978 amnesty decree. At least 80 percent of the military government's 2,603 victims died or """"disappeared"""" during the period covered by the decree, during which Chile was under a state of siege.     The recent advances in criminal prosecutions have mostly been possible because the courts have ceased applying the amnesty decree in cases of forced disappearance, ruling that the crime is ongoing until the death of the victim can be established.     Eight defendants, including Manuel Contreras, the chief of Pinochet's secret police, have been convicted of kidnapping in the past year for Pinochet-era crimes. The future of these prosecutions hinges on the future rulings of Chile's appellate courts, including ultimately the Supreme Court.     On August 12, 2003, President Ricardo Lagos announced a package of new measures relating the court cases. These include the offer of immunity from prosecution to persons not already under trial who come forward to testify about abuses, and of more lenient sentences to defendants who provide information that helps establish the facts.     While Human Rights Watch recognizes that these measures might encourage informants to come forward, it has urged the government not to offer immunity to those who participated in gross human rights abuses.     """"Senior officials have assured us that the government will not allow the perpetrators of crimes against humanity to escape prosecution, and we trust that it will stick to its guns when these measures are debated in Congress,"""" said Vivanco.     Human Rights Watch praised other initiatives announced by the Lagos government. A commission will be formed to draw up a list of torture victims who will receive compensation, thus addressing a long-neglected problem. The government also says that it will reform the system of military justice. Military courts still exercise jurisdiction over civilians in certain cases, a hitherto untouched legacy of the military government.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

State laws and local enforcement are preventing drug users from obtaining the sterile syringes they need to protect themselves from HIV. The 61-page report, “Injecting Reason: Human Rights and HIV Prevention for Injection Drug Users,” documents police stopping, arresting, and harassing participants in needle exchange programs established by some California counties under state law. Even where needle exchange programs are legal, police remain authorized to arrest program participants under an antiquated law prohibiting the possession of “drug paraphernalia.” “Restricting these sterile syringe programs amounts to a death sentence for injection drug users,” said Jonathan Cohen, researcher with Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “This is a high price to pay for the disease of addiction.” Over a quarter of new AIDS cases in the United States can be traced to infected syringes. Sharing syringes is also a major risk factor in the spread of hepatitis B and C. California is home to nearly one eighth of reported AIDS cases in the United States. Many California counties still ban needle exchange programs outright. In these counties, Human Rights Watch documented cases of drug users sharing syringes with others, reusing contaminated syringes, or buying used needles on the street. Some resort to digging for used needles in garbage dumpsters, gluing together the parts of old syringes, or sharing needles until they are dulled beyond usefulness. Others risk arrest and possible jail time to make contact with underground needle exchange services. “Needle exchange is an accepted form of health care, and the government is preventing people from getting to it,” Cohen said. “No one should have to choose between becoming HIV-positive and going to jail.” The Human Rights Watch report cites evidence establishing the benefits of sterile syringe programs, including a 2000 survey of needle exchange research by former U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher. Every government agency that has studied needle exchange, including the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health, has concluded that clean needle programs dramatically reduce the spread of HIV and hepatitis C without increasing drug use. Participants in clean needle programs also receive safer sex information and referrals to addiction treatment. Since 1988, the U.S. government has banned the use of federal money to fund needle exchange programs. Supporters of the federal ban maintain that the programs send the wrong message about drug use. “Governments can send a clear message against drug use without sacrificing the lives of drug users,” Cohen said. “The only message sent by restricting clean needle programs is that drug users’ lives aren’t worth saving.” Human Rights Watch called on California and other states to amend their drug paraphernalia laws to allow the possession of syringes for the purpose of disease prevention. The Human Rights Watch report recommends legalization of needle exchange programs and nonprescription pharmacy sales of syringes. It also calls on police departments to cease stops and seizures of participants in clean needle programs, a practice courts have recently prohibited in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York.","United States","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Former political prisoner Abdullah Zouari received a nine-month sentence August 29 after a politically motivated prosecution on charges of violating a ministerial order. The next day, disabled ex-political prisoner Lassad Jouhri was beaten on a Tunis street by four men in plainclothes – an attack that mimicked two prior assaults on him by state security officers. Both men had been openly helpful in providing information to human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch. “Abdullah Zouari and Lassad Jouhri have called attention to the dire plight of Islamist prisoners and ex-prisoners,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. “In Tunisia, that sort of human rights work is especially dangerous.” Human Rights Watch urged Tunisian authorities to release Zouari from prison and lift all restrictions on his liberties. It also called for a criminal investigation into the assault against Jouhri. Tunisian authorities have increased their repression of dissidents and human rights defenders over the past decade. Dissidents are frequently subjected to heavy police surveillance, travel bans, dismissals from work, interruptions in phone service, harassment of family members, and a refusal to legalize most independent rights organizations. Human rights lawyers and activists have been assaulted on the street by plainclothesmen acting in complete impunity. Their property has been subject to vandalism, and their homes and offices to suspicious break-ins. The government has also used the courts, which lack independence, to convict and imprison critics of its rights record. Background On August 29, after a trial lasting only a few minutes, a district judge in Jerjis, in the south of Tunisia, ordered Zouari to serve a nine-month sentence; the judge denied his request for release pending an appeal. Zouari’s lawyers, who protested that they had been prevented from meeting their client prior to the trial, argued that Zouari had not violated the terms of the order confining him to the province of Medenine and that the prosecution was politically motivated. Zouari, who has been held in Harboub prison in southern Tunisia since his arrest on August 17, has now been convicted on three separate occasions since June 2002, when he completed an 11-year sentence on charges of “membership in an illegal organization.” Zouari was a senior editor and writer at the time with al-Fajr, a publication linked to Tunisia’s Nahdha (Renaissance) party, an Islamist movement that has been ruthlessly repressed since the early 1990s. Since his release in 2002, he contributed essays for various Internet publications and recently wrote that he would attempt to resurrect al-Fajr online. When sentenced to 11 years in prison, Zouari was also ordered placed under “administrative control” upon his release, a punishment that restricts the liberties of ex-prisoners. However, Zouari in 2002 filed a challenge to the legality of the Interior Ministry order banishing him to Medenine, a remote southern district far from his family in Tunis. His appeal has yet to be ruled upon. Since 2002, Zouari has encouraged international protest against his banishment. He has also drawn attention to the plight of other victims of rights abuses, assisting a delegate of Human Rights Watch to meet with victims and their families in the south of the country in early August. Zouari was convicted in August 2002 and sentenced to eight months in prison for disobeying his administrative control order – the same violation of Article 150 of the criminal code for which he has now been convicted a second time. Zouari served two months of that first sentence before his release in November 2002 for “humanitarian reasons.” Zouari was convicted again in July 2003 and sentenced to four months in prison for “libel” after a dispute with the owner of an Internet café who Zouari said had denied him entry. Zouari has appealed that decision. On August 30 at about 11:30 a.m., four men in plainclothes assaulted Lassad Jouhri in front of the downtown Tunis office of Mohamed Nouri, president of the one-year-old International Association for the Support of Political Prisoners (Association internationale de soutien aux prisonniers politiques, AISPP). Jouhri has been a key intermediary between prisoners and their families, on the one hand, and those seeking information about human rights conditions in Tunisia. As in two previous similar incidents, assailants beat Jouhri without being stopped, and have not since been identified or arrested. Jouhri was among several human rights activists assaulted by plainclothes policemen on December 13, 2002 outside the office of another AISPP member, lawyer Saïda Akremi. And on August 28, 2002, five men in plainclothes beat Jouhri on a street in downtown Tunis, breaking one of his crutches and using it to strike him. The men refused to identify themselves to Jouhri. However, when ordering a uniformed policeman not to intervene, they identified themselves as security agents. Jouhri limps due to injuries he sustained under torture in Tunisian prisons. Tunisian authorities have refused to legalize the AISPP since its founders applied for legal recognition in November 2002. In early August 2003, AISPP President Mohamed Nouri and Mokhtar Yahiaoui, president of another unrecognized human rights organization, the Tunisian Center for an Independent Judiciary, appeared in a Tunis court to answer charges of knowingly disseminating “false information.” The case is continuing. In addition, vandals damaged on August 26 the car belonging to AISPP co-founder Samir Ben Amor, a Tunis-based human rights attorney. The car, which Ben Amor had purchased a few days earlier, was the only vehicle that was defaced in the private lot where it had been parked. Cars belonging to a number of human rights activists in Tunis have in the past been vandalized or stolen. Ben Amor had been openly helpful to Human Rights Watch during its August visit to Tunisia. He has filed a complaint with the Tunis police regarding the damage.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

""""The Indian government must demonstrate that it's on the side of justice, not those who organized this massacre,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These three activists are trying to stand up to a state government that has done little to bring about accountability for thousands of victims and now they themselves are targets."""" Teesta Setalvad, Rais Khan Azeezkhan Pathan and Suhel Tirmizi have received anonymous telephone calls threatening their lives if they continue their work. On August 29, Pathan was threatened by a group of Hindu nationalists as he escorted witnesses to an official inquiry into the massacres. The communal violence in Gujarat began on February 27, 2002, over allegations that a Muslim mob in the town of Godhra had attacked and set fire to two carriages of a train carrying Hindu activists. Fifty-eight people were killed. Over the next three days, a retaliatory killing spree by Hindus left hundreds dead and tens of thousands homeless in Gujarat. A Human Rights Watch report on the violence (We Have No Orders to Save You) concluded that Gujarat state officials were directly involved in the killings and engaged in a massive cover-up. A follow-up report by Human Rights Watch (Compounding Injustice: The Government's Failure to Redress Massacres in Gujarat), published in July 2003, concluded that the massacre's ringleaders were still at large. Human Rights Watch has asked the Indian federal government to take over investigations in cases where the state government has hampered litigation. Although the Indian government initially boasted of thousands of arrests following the attacks, most of those arrested have since been acquitted, released on bail with no further action taken, or simply let go. Even when cases have reached trial, Muslim victims faced biased prosecutors and judges, harassment and intimidation. In one case, 14 people were set on fire and killed in the Best Bakery in Vadodara, Gujarat. A Gujarat state court acquitted 21 people accused of the killings after witnesses withdrew statements they had given to the police identifying the attackers. A prime witness in that case, Zahira Sheikh, told India's National Human Rights Commission she was forced to change her testimony as a result of threats against her during the trial. Setalvad, Pathan, and Tirmizi have provided protection and legal assistance to Sheikh and her family members, including moving them to a secure location in Mumbai. On August 20, the three human rights defenders requested police protection from Gujarat's chief secretary and director general of police and the police commissioner of Ahmedabad. There has been no response to date. The defenders also filed an application for protection before the Supreme Court of India on September 1. In the letter, addressed to Deputy Prime Minister L.K. Advani, Human Rights Watch called on the Indian government to: o Immediately provide proper and adequate protection to Teesta Setalvad, Rais Khan Azeezkhan Pathan, and Suhel Tirmizi; o Ensure a retrial of the Best Bakery case outside Gujarat and provide adequate protection for witnesses in the case; o Direct federal authorities to take over cases of serious, large-scale human rights violations where the state government has hampered investigations, including the Godhra, Naroda Patia, and Gulbarg Society massacre cases.","Asia, India",""

The Council is currently debating a new resolution on Iraq. he draft resolution circulated by the United States this week seeks international assistance for the stabilization and reconstruction of Iraq, but makes no reference to justice or human rights issues. """"President Bush and Prime Minister Blair placed great emphasis on the abuses Saddam Hussein committed against his own people as a justification for military action against Iraq,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But what are they doing now to ensure justice and accountability for those terrible crimes?"""" The Coalition Provisional Authority has failed to take concrete steps to ensure those responsible receive fair trials before impartial and independent courts. While some recent efforts have been made, coalition forces initially failed to secure gravesites, resulting in the destruction of substantial evidence, and numerous documents were pilfered or destroyed in looting. """"It is a sad irony that the United States and United Kingdom should be investing such effort in investigating Saddam's chemical and biological weapons program, but at the same time doing so little with regard to justice for his crimes against his own people,"""" Roth said. Ensuring accountability for past abuses would be essential for establishing security in Iraq by dissuading people from taking the law into their own hands, Human Rights Watch said. The Security Council should appoint a group of international and Iraqi experts to coordinate evidence collection and preservation and consider justice options, as it did for the former Yugoslavia. This proposal was supported by late Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN Secretary General's Special Representative in Iraq, before his death last month in a bomb attack. Human Rights Watch stressed that any justice or accountability process in Iraq must have legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the Iraqi people and international community as a whole. It warned that after thirty years of Ba'ath Party rule the Iraqi judicial system lacked the capacity and independence to try crimes of this complexity and magnitude and would need international support and assistance.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/03/turkmenistan-dissidents-father-sent-internal-exile","Turkmenistan- Dissidents Father Sent into Internal Exile","Turkmenistan: Dissident’s Father Sent into Internal Exile","","09/03/2003","The Turkmen government should immediately free a dissident’s elderly father who was forced last week into internal exile, Human Rights Watch said today. Four Ministry of Internal Affairs agents seized Sazak Begmedov, 77, on August 31 in the capital, Ashgabad, and forced him onto a flight for Dashauz, near the border with Uzbekistan. The incident occurred 12 days after Begmedov’s daughter, Turkmen exile Tajigul Begmedova, founded the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation, a new human rights group based in Bulgaria. “This is a clear case of retaliation. The government is punishing the daughter by attacking the father,” said Rachel Denber, deputy director for Europe and Central Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. “Turkmenistan has one of the most repressive governments in the world. This is only the latest example of how the government persecutes dissidents’ families.” Sazak Begmedov, a former deputy prosecutor general, has spent the past year challenging the legality of the government’s actions against his family. The Begmedovs fell out of favor with President Saparmurat Niazov in September 2002, when Tajigul’s husband, Annadurdy Khajiev, was indicted on charges of embezzlement. The government confiscated Begmedov’s house, arrested two of his children, and threatened to send him into internal exile. In May 2003, a Bulgarian court declined a request by the Turkmen government for the extradition of Tajigul Begmedova and Annadurdy Khajiev. The court found the government’s charges groundless and cited fears that the charges had been politically motivated. Begmedov has told relatives that on the day of his abduction, four agents approached him outside his building on Atamurad Niazov Street and told him he was summoned to a meeting at the Procuracy General. Once he got in the car, they beat him and kicked him and drove him to the airport, where they forced him onto a flight to Dashauz. Police guards accompanied him on the flight and confiscated his passport. The police refused to show an arrest warrant or deportation order, saying only that his deportation from the capital was “ordered from above.” They also said it was connected with “some international Turkmen organization” -- presumably the Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation. Police awaiting his arrival in Dashauz brought Begmedov, at his request, to the local police department, where he demanded an explanation. The police chief gave none, and instead instructed Begmedov that he must inform police of his whereabouts at all times. In Dashauz, Begmedov went to several medical clinics to obtain an official doctor’s report certifying that the bruises on his body were from the beatings by police. Every doctor he approached refused to write such a report, citing fear of retaliation by the authorities. When Begmedov went to the police to submit an official statement about the beating, they refused to accept and log the complaint. “The diplomatic community has to act now to protect Begmedov and demand restoration of his right to freedom of movement,” said Denber. “Silence puts the families of other dissidents at risk for the same treatment.” Human Rights Watch has received information about another four cases of internal exile of political or religious dissidents in March, April and May of this year. Such treatment is part of official Turkmen government policy. On November 18, 2002, President Niazov issued a decree on population relocations to Dashauz, Lebap and Ahal provinces, ostensibly to develop these desert areas. But the order also marks for relocation “those people who have lost the respect of the nation, and who disturb the social tranquility with their bad behavior.” The imposition of internal exile without a fair trial is a violation of the right to freedom of movement under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Turkmenistan is party. In April 2003, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution condemning human rights abuses in Turkmenistan that expressed concern about forced displacement to “remote areas of the country.” The resolution calls on the government to end this practice. At the hands of Turkmen law enforcement and security agents, family members of Turkmen dissidents in exile have consistently suffered illegal arrest, physical mistreatment and eviction from their homes, as well as forced displacement, in retaliation for their relatives’ beliefs. The use of internal exile or forced displacement to silence and punish “enemies” was standard practice in the Soviet Union.","Europe/Central Asia, Turkmenistan",""

The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings on the issue today. Human Rights Watch called on governments, including the United States, to follow a growing international trend of giving legal recognition to gay and lesbian relationships. The Netherlands and Belgium give gay and lesbian couples the right to full civil marriage. Numerous other counties recognize same-sex partnerships in law, including Croatia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Iceland, Norway, Portugal, and Sweden. Countries that extend some benefits to same-sex partners, or contain jurisdictions that do so, include: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Italy, New Zealand, South Africa, and Spain. “On almost every continent, governments are moving to stop discrimination against same-sex relationships,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Yet in the United States, some legislators are trying to etch this prejudice in stone.” Lack of access to marriage rights imposes discriminatory, and often damaging, burdens on same-sex partners, the Human Rights Watch briefing paper said. They may be denied shared health or employment benefits; protections against domestic violence; inheritance rights; the right to raise a child together; the right to make medical decisions for a sick partner or a partner’s child; and rights to equal tax benefits and joint insurance policies. “International human rights law prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation,” said Roth. “Just as the law must ensure that men and women are equal in marriage, so the law must ensure that everyone has equal access to marriage.” Human Rights Watch considers “civil unions” or “domestic partnerships” inadequate alternatives to legally recognizing same-sex marriage rights. “Separate is never equal,” said Roth. “Civil unions are a step in the right direction. But they almost always offer less than the full roster of rights that marriage entails – and they still stigmatize same-sex relationships as deserving only second-class recognition.” The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that criminal penalties for consensual homosexual conduct violate the constitutional right to privacy. Although that decision did not address marriage rights, on May 21, 2003, U.S. Representative Marilyn Musgrave and five co-sponsors introduced a House of Representatives resolution to amend the U.S. Constitution to define marriage as consisting “only of the union of a man and a woman.” A hearing on the proposed amendment will be held on September 4 in the Senate Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Constitution. Meanwhile, in recent months, courts in Canada have ordered the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia to open marriage to gays and lesbians. Debate on federal legislation that would extend marriage rights to gays and lesbians is expected in Canada within months.","United States","LGBT Rights"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/09/03/cuba-human-rights-and-us-policy","Cuba- Human Rights and US Policy","Cuba: Human Rights and US Policy","Statement by Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director","09/03/2003","Thank you for your invitation to address the human rights situation in Cuba and to discuss U.S. policy towards that country. Human Rights Watch has been monitoring human rights conditions in Cuba for more than 15 years. Severe political repression has been constant throughout this time. Cuba has long been a one-party state. It has long restricted nearly all avenues of political dissent. It has long denied its people basic rights to fair trial, free expression, association, assembly, movement and the press. It has frequently sought to silence its critics by using short term detentions, house arrests, travel restrictions, threats, surveillance, politically motivated dismissals from employment, and other harassment.  But this year's crackdown on political dissent in Cuba, in its scale and intensity, is the worst we've seen in a decade or more. The crackdown was a reaction to the flowering of civil society in Cuba over the last several years, and to the growing activism and ambitions of its dissident community. It followed the success of the Varela Project, led by dissident Oswaldo Paya, in gathering signatures from Cuban citizens on a petition calling for political reform.  The crackdown began on March 18. In just a few days, state security agents arrested dozens of people, launching an all-out offensive against nonviolent dissidents, independent journalists, human rights defenders, independent librarians, and others brave enough to challenge the government’s monopoly on truth. In due process terms, their trials were a sham. And in the end, 75 defendants received sentences ranging from 6 to 28 years, with an average sentence of 19 years. Cuban courts have not imposed such draconian sentences on such large numbers of people in more than two decades.  What do these troubling developments mean for U.S. policy towards Cuba? What approach offers the greatest likelihood of effecting change? The first thing I hope we can all agree on is that no one should have any illusions about the character of the Cuban government. No one should romanticize any aspect of this cruel system, or make any excuses for Fidel Castro’s abuses. The crackdown on dissent in Cuba is not the fault of the United States, or the fault of the U.S. embargo, or the fault of the Cuban-American community. The responsibility lies with Fidel Castro, period. We should also agree that this is no time to reward Fidel Castro; this is a time for maximizing effective pressure on the Cuban government to change its policies. But we also need to be tough-minded and strategic in assessing whether the all-out embargo currently in place is the best available tool for achieving our goals. Is it likely to move the Cuban government? Do Cuba’s cynical rulers even see it as punitive? I believe the answer to those questions is no, and that a middle ground approach would serve the cause of Cuba’s brave dissidents far better. I say that as someone who is often supportive of economic sanctions, even unilateral economic sanctions, against governments that systematically violate human rights. My organization believes that sanctions, when carefully targeted and deployed as part of a larger diplomatic strategy, can be effective in promoting human rights and in expressing where the United States stands on human rights. This year, for example, we applauded the Congress and members of this Committee for supporting additional U.S. sanctions against the government of Burma. We are generally skeptical of arguments that trade with the United States or exposure to American values and practices can somehow convince repressive governments to be kinder and gentler to their people. But it seems to us that any American policy designed to promote human rights in another country has to meet two basic tests to be worthy of continuation. First, is the policy more likely to be effective than the alternatives? Second, does it advance the interests and speak to the needs of those struggling to defend human rights in the country concerned? After 40 years, it’s clear that the all-out embargo against Cuba fails both tests.  Many of the dissidents struggling for change inside Cuba want to see the embargo eased, including the writer Raul Rivero and the activist Hector Palacios Ruiz, who were sentenced, respectively, to 20 and 25 years in prison in April, as well as Oswaldo Paya, the leader of the Varela Project. Refusing to heed those who risk everything for freedom in Cuba is senseless. It would be as if the United States had taken steps to defend liberty in the old Soviet empire that were categorically opposed by Andrei Sakharov, Lech Walesa, and Vaclav Havel.  Leading Cuban dissidents understand that the embargo helps Fidel Castro’s cause, not theirs. Because it is indiscriminate, rather than targeted, it enables the Cuban government to shift blame to the United States for the Cuban people’s suffering. Because it isolates the Cuban people from the world, it makes it easier for the Cuban government to control what they hear, see and know. Because it is bitterly opposed by most nations, it enables the Cuban government to divide the international community, leading, ironically, to less international pressure on Fidel Castro, not more.  At the same time, a relaxation or end to the embargo would not, by itself, be an effective strategy for promoting change in Cuba. We need to be clear-eyed about this, as well: The Cuban government isn’t going to stop locking up dissidents just because American tourists have joined the Canadians sunning themselves on Cuba’s beaches, or because American CEO’s have joined the Europeans signing contracts with Fidel Castro. There does need to be carefully targeted, multilateral pressureon the Cuban government, or Cuba’s dissidents won’t have the space to fight for change. We need a middle ground between unquestioning engagement with the Castro government and an all-or-nothing approach that plays into Fidel Castro’s hands. All sides in the Cuba policy debate need to ask themselves: What does Castro fear most from the United States? It is not the continuation of the embargo, or its demise. It is the prospect that the United States might someday agree with allies in Latin America and Europe on an effective common strategy for defending the rights of the Cuban people. For that reason, I would argue that America’s Cuba policy should not even be directed at Havana right now. Given the history of this relationship, there is very little the United States can do bilaterally to influence the Cuban government. Instead, America’s Cuba policy should be directed towards the other nations of Latin America, towards Europe, towards Canada. It should be aimed at forging a principled, common strategy for promoting political change in Cuba.  A united international community will have immensely more political and moral authority with theCuban government than a divided international community. Because of the crackdown in Cuba, there is an opportunity now to forge a more united approach. The European Union has already toughened its common position on Cuba, for example. Latin American countries have supported resolutions on human rights in Cuba at the U.N., which, although far too mild, are a step forward. But much more can be done. The United States should be urging Latin democracies to speak forcefully against political repression in Cuba, and to stop backing Cuban membership in bodies like the U.N. Commission for Human Rights. It should press Latin diplomats to meet with Cuban dissidents. It should urge European countries to impose on the Cuban leadership the same targeted sanctions, including the denial of visas and the seizure assets, that they have imposed against other repressive governments, such as Burma and Zimbabwe. While easing some trade and investment with Cuba, and ending the senseless ban on travel to Cuba, the United States should also work with allies to develop common rules governing economic engagement there. Foreign investment in new private enterprises has helped limit the power of the state in countries like China and Vietnam. But in Cuba, workers in joint ventures with foreign companies are still hired and paid by the Cuban government, thus remaining at the mercy of the state. European, Canadian and ultimately American companies should receive licenses for investment in Cuba only if that policy changes. The tragedy of the all-out U.S. embargo, and a key argument for easing it, is that it makes the United States impotent in pressing its allies for these tougher measures. The Bush administration knows it has virtually no influence with the rest of the world on Cuba. When Cuba was up for reelection to the U.N. Human Rights Commission this year, the administration hardly even tried to convince Latin countries to find an alternative candidate. In most capitals, Castro has succeeded in making the embargo a bigger issue than his own repression.  The best alternative to dumb sanctions against Cuba, therefore, is not a policy of no sanctions. It should be possible to forge a middle path that isolates the Cuban government, not the Cuban people. But so long as the United States is unwilling to climb down to a tough, yet sensible policy, it will not persuade its allies to rise up to such a policy. I thank the Committee for its willingness to explore that alternative.","Americas, United States, Cuba",""

Human Rights Watch found that at one hospital, the door to the AIDS clinic was actually padlocked. National laws discriminate against people with HIV/AIDS, and some local laws ban them from using swimming pools or working in food service. The police send drug users to detoxification centers, where they are forced to labor without pay to make trinkets for tourists. Instead of receiving help for their problem, they are driven underground, making it harder for the government to combat the AIDS virus. The 94-page report, """"Locked Doors: The human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS in China"""", is based on more than 30 interviews with people with HIV/AIDS, police officers, drug users, and AIDS outreach workers in Beijing, Hong Kong, and Yunnan province. """"Discrimination is forcing many people to live as outcasts, and the Chinese government tolerates it instead of combatting it,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"That is sure to make the AIDS crisis worse."""" The Human Rights Watch report documents:  The spread of HIV through unsafe state-run blood collection centers in seven provinces, the cover-up of the epidemic by local officials, and the state's failure to provide treatment or hold officials accountable; Restrictions on freedom of expression, assembly, association and the right to information of those living with HIV/AIDS and those seeking to help them; Discrimination based on HIV status by government hospitals and government employees; Mandatory HIV testing in state facilities and violations of patient confidentiality; and Lack of access to treatment and other issues in China's underfunded and problem-ridden health care system. In Yunnan province, Human Rights Watch researchers visited Southeast Asia's largest forced detoxification center, where drug users live in crowded, unclean cells without adequate food or clean water. The centers test drug users for HIV without their knowledge, do not inform those who test positive, and do not offer treatment for HIV/AIDS Chinese government documents obtained by Human Rights Watch show HIV prevalence rates among blood donors ranging from four to forty percent across seven provinces, provinces that have a combined total population of 420 million. This suggests that the number of persons with HIV is much higher than the one million cases that Beijing officially acknowledges. Beijing has recently issued some positive policy statements about HIV/AIDS, asserting the importance of non-discrimination in national action plans. Some local legislatures, such as in Suzhou city, have passed regulations to protect the rights of people with HIV/AIDS. Small-scale pilot AIDS education and prevention projects could be expanded and successful laws and practices in Hong Kong could be studied on the mainland. But the Human Rights Watch report emphasizes that the relatively small number of projects fails to address the scope of the escalating AIDS crisis. """"SARS showed the importance of national leadership and a strong public health system in fighting an epidemic,"""" said Adams. """"It is time for Beijing to show the same resolve in helping people with HIV/AIDS."""" The Chinese government continues to abet the local cover-up of one of the world's greatest HIV/AIDS scandals, the Human Rights Watch report shows. Chinese citizens in seven central provinces contracted HIV through state-run blood collection centers, but few have received treatment or compensation, and not a single official has been prosecuted to date. """"It is time for China to confront the blood collection scandal,"""" Adams said. """"Beijing should authorize a full and impartial investigation into the involvement of local authorities in the blood scandal, and hold those responsible accountable. If China can't do this, it should ask the United Nations or another independent organization to establish the facts."""" China should immediately start providing compensation and treatment to anyone who directly or indirectly contracted HIV/AIDS as a result of the unprecedented blood collection scandal, Adams said. Accounts from Locked Doors: The human rights of people living with HIV/AIDS in China: Someone from the Center for Disease Control will call the work unit and say """"that person has AIDS""""-and then the person gets fired. Cao, international NGO staff person The government should help us and give us space, space in the cities and space in the countryside. They should not discriminate against us. But this is easy to say and hard to do. In the government, there are many people who see us as garbage, as something they have to get rid of to prevent their own loss of face. Kong, drug user and person living with HIV/AIDS I call up the hospitals first and tell them straight out that I'm positive. They won't treat me ... When I get sick later, I might just leave. I'll go somewhere far away, a nice place, and wait to die. Ji, person living with HIV/AIDS People who are HIV-positive need emotional support. Many people, when they find out they are HIV positive, suffer very much and are very sad. They have many needs-psychological, medical, and legal-but many people just stay at home for years and years.

""""Asian leaders should insist on the release of political detainees, and, in the interim, that diplomats and humanitarian agencies be allowed unmonitored visits to them,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Asian leaders have said they would press for change in Burma. It's time to make good on that commitment."""" On June 17, ASEAN called for national reconciliation in Burma and the early release of political detainees. But the Southeast Asian organization has done little to follow up. China, viewed as the Burmese government's biggest supporter, has rejected attempts by the United States and the European Union to use economic pressure to change the Burmese government's policies. Japan, another major donor, recently froze any new economic aid to Burma. Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has been detained since May, along with 17 members of her opposition party, the National League for Democracy. The group was traveling through northern Burma, attracting large crowds of supporters, when they were attacked by members of the Union Solidarity Development Association, a government-created organization. The Burmese government has acknowledged that four of Suu Kyi's supporters were killed in that attack. Opposition sources claim many more deaths and injuries, as well as the arrest of a large number of Suu Kyi's supporters.

Our researchers heard it over and over again as they interviewed people with HIV/AIDS in China: """"I'm waiting to die."""" In China, hospitals routinely turn AIDS patients away, because health workers are afraid of contracting AIDS themselves, and because they're afraid of scaring away paying customers. So at least a million and probably many more in China are waiting to die without any medical care at all. Officially, China's national AIDS policy discourages discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS. But in fact, these people are frequently hounded out of their homes, fired from their jobs, and refused medical care on the basis of their status, with no way to seek redress. Chinese hospitals routinely test patients for HIV/AIDS without even telling them. One health worker admitted to Human Rights Watch that the hospital calls up employers or families to warn them that a person they know is HIV positive. Hospital AIDS wards could hardly be less hospitable. At one Yunnan hospital in an area with high HIV prevalence, Human Rights Watch researchers found that the AIDS ward was actually closed, with a bicycle chain and padlock over the door handles. Ji, a 19-year-old we interviewed in the Yunnan capital of Kunming, said he entered a local hospital a year ago with a number of health problems, not knowing he was HIV-positive. Told he needed an operation, Ji was lying on a cot late at night when his surgeon abruptly told him, without explanation, """"We can't treat you here."""" Ji later went to a local health center and discovered the truth about his condition. Now Ji and others who are HIV-positive live virtually underground, with no access to health care or support services. They hide their symptoms from their families. Some wear scarves and hats to hide from neighbors, and move around from one neighborhood to the next, fleeing when neighbors or landlords find out they are HIV-positive. Then they hole up on cots in back-alley tenements -- with no one to bring them food, change their sheets, or even offer basic human empathy -- and wait for the end. Beijing has an official policy of trying to discourage the spread of AIDS. But discrimination in the health-care system is producing the opposite result: People with HIV/AIDS often live on the margins, beyond the reach of counselors and other professionals who can help stop the spread of the disease. There are no national laws against discrimination on the basis of HIV status, and no legal recourse for people with HIV/AIDS in China. Beijing has recently issued some positive policy statements about HIV/AIDS. It has even asserted the importance of non-discrimination in national action plans, though such plans do not have the force of law. Lawmakers in Suzhou city have passed regulations to protect the rights of people with HIV/AIDS. Yunnan, close to the heroin-producing Golden Triangle, reported the country's first cases of HIV among drug users in 1989. The epidemic quickly spread north along the drug trafficking route. Since then, while officials in some other Chinese provinces have actively covered up the AIDS epidemic -- particularly the blood scandal that has led to the infection of Chinese residents in seven central provinces -- Yunnan's more tolerant government has encouraged international aid organizations to launch innovative AIDS prevention projects. But people living with HIV/AIDS live so far at the margins of society that some of these projects never reach them. Unless the central government addresses the problem of discrimination -- a fundamental violation of human rights -- well-meaning AIDS projects aren't going to hit their mark. The SARS epidemic showed the importance of national leadership and a strong public health system in fighting these kinds of diseases. It is time for Beijing to show the same resolve in helping people with HIV/AIDS. The new political leadership in Beijing should create laws protecting the rights of people with HIV/AIDS, and establish government agencies that can investigate and resolve complaints of discrimination. It should also authorize major increases in AIDS education, prevention and treatment projects. If Beijing wants to find a Chinese model, it could also look to successful laws and practices in Hong Kong. One of the world's most severe HIV/AIDS epidemics has hit China.

The Croatian government has registered more than 100,000 returns, but many returnees, after a short stay in Croatia, depart again for Serbia and Montenegro or Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1991 Serbs made up 12.1 percent of Croatia’s population, but the 2001 census showed their number had fallen to 4.5 percent. Most of those who have returned have been elderly farmers whose houses were not destroyed or occupied, and who receive old-age pensions from the government. Return to urban areas is rare, because the refugees cannot repossess their pre-war apartments or obtain substitute housing. Young and middle-aged Croatian Serbs are dissuaded from returning by lack of employment opportunities and, for men, fear of arbitrary arrests on war crime charges. These problems are a result of a practice of ethnic discrimination against Serbs by the Croatian government, Human Rights Watch said. The report contrasts the difficulties in return of Serbs with the government’s success in enabling the vast majority of ethnic Croats to return to their pre-war homes. """"The government has never genuinely tried to facilitate Serb return,"""" said Leicht. """"Instead, the authorities have consistently prioritized the needs and rights of ethnic Croats—including Croat refugees from Bosnia—over the rights of Serb refugees and returnees."""" The Human Rights Watch report is based on two years of research involving a comprehensive review of local legislation and extensive interviews with returned refugees, temporary occupants of their houses, and representatives of Serb civic associations, national and local governmental bodies, international organizations, and Croatian human rights groups. The report includes recommendations to the Croatian government and the international community to facilitate the return of Serb refugees. Personal accounts from “Broken Promises: Impediments to Refugee Return in Croatia”: Ivan Kovac, a Bosnian-born Croat, lived as an immigrant in Australia until he came to Croatia in 1995. Since 1997, Kovac has run a restaurant in Gracac in a home owned by Danilo Stanic, a Serb. Stanic and his wife returned to Gracac in 1998, but the local housing commission ignored their repeated requests that the commission evict Kovac. In July 2002, pursuant to Stanic’s private lawsuit, Gracac municipal court ordered that Kovac vacate the part of the house used as a restaurant, but the restaurant continued operating as of June 2003, pending a court decision on Kovac’s appeal. Boja Gajica (53), a Serb returnee to Knin, applied eight times between 1996 and 2000 for the position of nursing attendant, for which she has an associate degree. Each time a Croat candidate, with lower or different qualifications, was selected. On one occasion, the manager of a child-care center allegedly told Ms. Gajica that she would be afraid of the local soldiers and policemen if she employed a Serb. In June 2002, Human Right Watch observed the court proceedings on repossession of property, in which the defendants—a Bosnian Croat wife and her Muslim husband, occupants of a three-story Serb house in Karlovac—explained that they opposed sharing the house temporarily with the owner because, in the husband’s words, “He cannot live with us. We were at war with such like him for four years.” The owner, Dusan Vilenica, returned to Karlovac in 1998 and has been unable to reoccupy the house or move into its uninhabited parts since.","Europe/Central Asia, Croatia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

As Nepal and Bhutan prepared for further talks next week, the delegation urged donor governments to insist the process meet international human rights and refugee standards. """"The refugee screening process violates every international norm in the book,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy advisor with Human Rights Watch. The mission visited the Bhutanese refugee camps in southeast Nepal, where more than 100,000 refugees live in seven camps. They have been there since the 1990s, when they were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality and forcibly expelled from Bhutan. Nearly one-sixth of Bhutan's population was forced to flee the country at that time, making Bhutan one of the highest per capita generators of refugees in the world. Since March 2001 the governments of Bhutan and Nepal have been screening the refugees in Khudunabari camp - population 12,000 - to determine their identities and their reasons for leaving Bhutan. The results of the screening, announced on June 18, 2003, will be used in determining the refugees' fate. Refugees interviewed by the mission told of serious anomalies and failings in the verification process. These include: Refugees were forced to recount their reasons for leaving Bhutan to officials of the same government responsible for their persecution and flight; The criteria for categorizing refugees is not made public, so the refugees cannot effectively appeal their classification; The majority of the refugees (70%) were classified as """"voluntary migrants"""" after signing """"voluntary migration forms"""" under duress when leaving Bhutan; Many refugees in this category told the delegation that they were forced to flee discrimination, arbitrary detention, sexual violence, and threats to their physical safety in Bhutan; In some cases, members of the same family have been placed in different categories, even though their reasons for fleeing Bhutan are identical, so they risk separation in the event of repatriation; Some of the children born in the refugee camps have been classified as so-called """"criminals"""" and could be liable to stand trial in Bhutan; Some refugees who were minors in Bhutan and thus were not given identity documents have been classified as non-Bhutanese, even though their parents possess identity papers and have been put in different categories; The joint screening team only interviewed male heads of households, denying women the opportunity to have their claims fairly considered; There were no women on the joint screening team for most of the review process; Refugees were divided into the following categories: Category I - Bona fide Bhutanese citizens (293 people - just 2.5 percent of the refugee population); Category II - Refugees who supposedly """"voluntarily"""" migrated from Bhutan (8,595 people, or 70 percent of the refugees); Category III - Non-Bhutanese (2,948 people, or 24 percent of the refugees); Category IV - Refugees who have committed """"criminal"""" acts, including those who participated in so-called """"anti-national"""" (pro-democracy) activities in Bhutan (347 people, or 3 percent of the refugees). """"This process simply does not stand up to scrutiny under international law,"""" said Peter Prove, Assistant to the General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. """"Refugees have been classified as """"criminals"""" in the absence of clear charges or any semblance of a trial, and apparently in punishment for exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of expression and association."""" Category II is similarly flawed. All the refugees classified as so-called """"voluntary migrants"""" told the mission that they signed so-called """"voluntary migration forms"""" under duress when they were expelled from Bhutan. Many were unaware of the content of these forms and that signing them would result in their loss of citizenship under Bhutanese law. """"Under international law everyone has the right to leave and return to their own country,"""" said Ralston Deffenbaugh, President of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service. """"Bhutan's policies clearly violate this right."""" According to the last round of talks between Bhutan and Nepal in May 2003, refugees in Category II will be required to reapply for citizenship after a minimum probationary period of two years upon returning to Bhutan. But successful applicants will have to meet stringent requirements including fluency in Dzongkha, which is spoken mainly in northern Bhutan. Since most refugees from Southern Bhutan speak only Nepali, this requirement would mean that tens of thousands of refugees would be unable to re-acquire citizenship and could be rendered stateless. A fifteenth round of talks between Bhutan and Nepal is due to begin on September 8. The delegation called on Bhutan and Nepal to address the inconsistencies and inadequacies in the screening process. They urged the following modifications:  All refugees in Categories I, II and IV should be able to return to Bhutan in safety and dignity, with full citizenship rights, and to their original lands and properties; Refugees in Category III should have access to a full, fair and independent appeal process; All anomalies in the process (such as members of the same family placed in different categories) must be investigated by an independent third party; Future screening should be according to two categories only: Bhutanese and non-Bhutanese. Those classified as Bhutanese should be able to return to Bhutan with full citizenship rights. Those classified as non-Bhutanese should have access to a full, fair and independent appeal process. Women should have full access to the verification process in order to assess their claims independently and fairly and the Joint Verification Team should include female interviewers; Screening and repatriation should not proceed without the presence of an independent third party.

During Ba'ath Party rule, that leadership perpetrated crimes including genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, torture, """"disappearances,"""" and summary and arbitrary executions.  In the genocidal 1988 """"Anfal"""" campaign, we estimate more than 100,000 Kurds, mostly men and boys, were trucked to remote sites and executed.  In the 1980s, the Iraqi government forcefully expelled over half a million Shi'a to Iran after separating out and imprisoning an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 Shi'a men and boys, most of whom remain unaccounted for.  Since the late 1970s, at least 290,000 people were """"disappeared"""" in Iraq.  To date, the United States and its coalition partners have failed to take concrete steps to ensure that those responsible for serious past crimes are brought to justice in fair trials before impartial and independent courts.  After taking control of Iraq, coalition forces failed to secure mass gravesites and substantial evidence was destroyed.  In the widespread looting that occurred following the fall of Baghdad and other cities, numerous documents were pilfered or ruined.  Efforts are now being made to protect some gravesites, but much damage has already been done.   The Coalition Provisional Authority, the civilian body governing Iraq, has not indicated what it intends to do with senior former Iraqi officials currently in custody.  As of August 22, 2003, thirty-seven of the U.S. government's list of fifty-five most wanted were in custody.    The U.S. administration has said that it wants to support an """"Iraqi-led process"""" to bring justice for serious past crimes in Iraq.  However, such a process likely will lack the capacity to adjudicate these cases effectively.  As trials in Iraq traditionally have lasted only a few days, it is unlikely that any judges, prosecutors, or investigators in Iraq have participated in trials as complex as those involving genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity charges.    There now exists considerable international experience and understanding of the various options for prosecuting genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes in accordance with international legal standards-particularly expertise gained through efforts to bring those most responsible for serious past crimes to justice, such as in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and Sierra Leone.  Human Rights Watch believes that a mixed Iraqi and international Group of Experts should be created to coordinate the collection and preservation of evidence and to recommend the most appropriate justice mechanisms for serious past crimes.  Human Rights Watch believes that either a mixed Iraqi-international tribunal or an international tribunal should be established to bring accountability for those most responsible for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.  Evidence Collection and Preservation There is an urgent need to collect and safeguard evidence that will be vital to the conduct of future trials.  Further destruction or mishandling of this evidence will undercut the possibility of bringing to justice those responsible for the worst crimes.  In addition, loss of evidence could prevent-beyond the needs of criminal trials-the comprehensive documentation of the crimes committed against the Iraqi people.   Intergovernmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals have expressed reluctance to handing over evidence without neutral, technical expertise to centralize its collection and preservation.  Similarly, some nongovernmental organizations have signaled hesitation to conduct forensic exhumations unless there is a neutral entity to which they can present their findings.  Based on experience from other post-conflict regions, as well as its research in Iraq, Human Rights Watch believes that a Group of Experts comprised of Iraqis and internationals should fulfill key components of evidence preservation and collection, in particular designing the necessary systems and means.  These include:  Designing a protocol for a central repository to receive and record documents and other forms of evidence;  Supplementing any existing protocols for deploying teams of forensic experts to assist in mass grave exhumations and training for Iraqi personnel to conduct exhumations; and  Developing minimum standards for gathering and preserving documentary, testimonial, and forensic evidence.   A Group of Experts facilitating the collection and preservation of evidence will have legitimacy, credibility, and experience and will enable Iraqis to fully benefit from the expertise of the international community.  The international experts would complement Iraqi expertise to document the nature, scope and identity of crimes committed by the previous government.   Fair Trials Bringing justice for serious past crimes including genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity committed in Iraq will be a highly complex and politically charged process.  Trying these crimes will require a vast and sophisticated investigative process. Evidence must be marshaled to serve focused prosecutions.   Evidence of crimes will need to be analyzed and then classified according to the crime scenes and the type of crime.      The actual process of investigation and trial of the former Iraqi leadership must be characterized by independence, impartiality and fairness so that justice is done and perceived to be done.  The court or courts conducting the trials must be independent from political influence, and free of bias and partiality.  The law must be applied equally to all accused without prejudice.  The trial must give all accused the benefit of every protection under international law so that the trials are fair.  Defendants must be regarded as innocent until proven guilty, and they must be available to conduct a vigorous defense that includes the right to legal counsel at an early stage.  Human Rights Watch believes that these characteristics are prerequisites to properly honoring the Iraqi victims and laying the deepest foundation for respecting the rule of law in the new Iraq.  In order to convey the full extent of the crimes committed against the Iraqi people, the responsible leaders should be charged with the most serious crimes under international law: genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  Because such crimes are not adequately codified in Iraqi criminal law, courts should apply international criminal law standards. Human Rights Watch believes these objectives would be best accomplished by the creation of a mixed Iraqi-international or international tribunal where international experts and norms would complement and assist Iraqi experience.  Incorporating this technical assistance would ensure a legal process that is maximally effective in documenting the crimes that have taken place in legal proceedings respected worldwide while bringing those most responsible to justice.  Iraqis could take advantage of international expertise to develop a model that is best suited to the particular conditions in Iraq.  International participation in the accountability process would not undermine Iraqi participation.  Courts for these trials could be located in Iraq, use Arabic and Kurdish as their official languages, be presided over by Iraqi and international judges, and apply the relevant provisions of Iraqi and international law.  Above all, the involvement of international expertise will complement and strengthen Iraqi expertise, experience and knowledge in precisely the areas where Iraqis themselves have identified the need for such assistance.  Determining the appropriate justice mechanisms for serious past crimes is an issue that requires careful analysis.  The proposed Group of Experts should also be tasked with: Recommending the types of accountability mechanisms for those who bear the greatest and those who bear lesser responsibility for serious past crimes; and   Identifying objective criteria for the selection of investigative and trial judges who will participate in the accountability mechanisms for serious past crimes. Creating a Group of Experts Human Rights Watch has called on the Iraqi Governing Council to work together with the United Nations to create a mixed Iraqi-international Group of Experts.  A mandate to establish a Group of Experts from the Security Council would be helpful as it would give the imprimatur of the Council.  Absent a Security Council resolution, there are other routes by which the U.N. might create a Group of Experts.  For example, the Secretary-General could appoint a Group of Experts as he did for the Democratic Republic of Congo and East Timor.  Alternatively, a newly appointed special representative to the Secretary-General for Iraq could establish a Group of Experts pursuant to his authority under Security Council Resolution 1483(8)(i) to coordinate activities including """"encouraging efforts to promote legal and judicial reform.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","United Nations"

In mid-August, both houses of Argentina's Congress voted by a large majority to annul the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, which had barred the prosecution of military officers for human rights violations.   On August 26, Human Rights Watch Americas Executive Director José Miguel Vivanco and researcher Sebastian Brett met in Buenos Aires with ministers in the Kirchner government and two members of the Argentine Supreme Court, Enrique Petracchi and Juan Maqueda. Though the justices could not discuss the cases now under consideration, they conveyed their approval of several past court decisions upholding international human rights law. Six months ago, no one would have bet money on the court nullifying the amnesty laws; now the odds seem better than even.   The Spanish human rights judge Baltasar Garzón sparked these developments by issuing warrants for the extradition of 45 former military officers and a civilian accused of torture and """"disappearances,"""" so that they could stand trial in Spain. In August, President Nestor Kirchner repealed a decree that prevented the extradition of Argentines from standing trial abroad for human rights crimes.   Since the parliamentary vote, and with the Supreme Court decision likely, it appears that the officers will be finally tried in Argentina. The Spanish government has announced it would drop its extradition request.   On September 2, the Federal Court of Buenos Aires ordered trials to be reopened into crimes committed in the Navy Mechanics School, a notorious torture center, and secret detention centers attached to the First Army Corps. Among those accused is Alfredo Astiz, a former naval intelligence agent who escaped extradition to France last year, and Carlos Suárez Mason, former commander of the First Army Corps, who was extradited to Argentina from the United States in 1988, and pardoned by then-President Carlos Menem.

The men beat Ikramov in the back of the car and repeatedly restricted his air supply by tightening a belt around his neck to close the plastic bag over his head.  The men drove Ikramov to the outskirts of Tashkent, where they demanded money from him, continued the beating, and then left him by the Chirchik River. Ikramov lost consciousness and only in the early evening was able to get help. Medical staff who later examined him confirmed that Ikramov had two broken ribs and a concussion.  Ikramov had been actively working as public defender for Sharipov, who was recently sentenced to five and a half years in prison for homosexuality and sexual relations with minors. Ikramov argued that the charges were trumped up and the trial unfair, and had organized protests in support of Sharipov. He was helping to organize a peaceful protest outside of parliament, scheduled for August 29, the day before he was attacked. He had also been actively defending Muslims persecuted by the authorities for practicing Islam outside of government-controlled institutions.  “The Uzbek government has a duty to investigate this brutal attack,” said Denber. “The international community should press the Uzbek government to ensure that the investigation is thorough and impartial, and should assess carefully the results of the investigation.”  Human Rights Watch has documented increased persecution of defenders and government critics in the weeks leading up to Uzbekistan’s September 1 Independence Day celebrations. On August 20, a group of women beat the organizer of a protest in Fergana city, Mutabar Tajibaeva, and the other participants in the protest. Tajibaeva has been hospitalized for a week for treatment of her injuries. She was demanding the resignation of a regional prosecutor and other officials, and believes that the authorities organized her beating.  On August 26, police detained Oleg Sarapulov, Ruslan Sharipov’s assistant, along with a friend, after they went to the police station to recover their mobile telephones that had been stolen. Police questioned them in an intimidating manner about alleged sexual activity for money and threatened to press charges against them. Prior to this, they had received anonymous threats over the telephone that they would suffer the same fate as Ruslan Sharipov.  On August 28, the Andijan Province Court pressed criminal defamation charges against a human rights defender, Saidjahon Zainabitdinov, in relation to an article that he wrote on police corruption.  On the morning of August 29, police came to the homes of several people intending to attend the protest that Surat Ikramov had been helping to organize outside the parliament that day and effectively put them under house arrest by preventing them from leaving their homes for the day. Others who managed to get to the area near the parliament were detained, put in buses, driven away, and later released. One activist, Elena Urlaeva, was on her way to the protest when people who later said they were from the National Security Service stopped her car and forcefully dragged her from it, kicking her. They detained her for several hours and later released her.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Most of the detainees have fled the war-torn Aceh province in neighboring Indonesia. Malaysian police have arrested some two hundred and fifty asylum seekers outside the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Kuala Lumpur over the last two weeks. Most of those arrested are now detained at Langkap immigration detention center. The UNHCR office in Kuala Lumpur recently designated Tuesdays as registration day for Indonesian asylum seekers. Over the last two Tuesdays, Malaysian police reportedly set up roadblocks outside of the UNHCR office and arrested all those seeking to make appointments with the refugee agency. The UNHCR office has now closed its operations because of the continued police presence outside its office. Although police arrested some Burmese and Bangladeshi asylum seekers, most of those arrested and detained are Acehnese, including at least one already recognized as a refugee by UNHCR. At least twelve have already been deported to Indonesia. """"Aceh is not a safe environment for refugees to return to,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"Malaysia's actions are unacceptable when both the Indonesian military and the rebel Free Aceh Movement are still committing abuses against the local population."""" Conditions in Aceh have been particularly bad after the Indonesian government launched an offensive in May 2003. Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights has already documented serious human rights violations in Aceh, including summary executions, arbitrary detentions, torture of unarmed civilians, sexual violence, forced displacement and the targeted burning of school buildings. The international legal principle of non-refoulement bars states from returning refugees to a country where they are likely to face persecution. This international standard applies to both recognized refugees and those seeking asylum before their claims have been processed. """"It is outrageous to target asylum seekers who are seeking the help of the U.N. refugee agency,"""" Adams said. """"The Malaysian government should allow the asylum seekers in Langkap immigration detention center free access to the UNHCR so that their claims can be heard. Under no circumstances should they be deported without a hearing."""" Malaysia has a long history of serving as temporary host for refugees fleeing persecution and conflict. However, many asylum seekers end up in one of Malaysia's detention centers, such as Langkap. Detainees in these camps regularly face violence, overcrowding, poor hygiene, and insufficient food. Malaysia also offers them very little legal protection. Refugees recognized by UNHCR are not protected under Malaysian law. Other refugees are forced to live in conditions of extreme insecurity because they are afraid to present themselves to UNHCR, or doubtful about the benefits of seeking its assistance. The recent arrests only exacerbate these problems. Refugees without government-issued documentation and even those with UNHCR issued documents regularly face detention and summary return, possibly resulting in refoulement.","Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia",""

The commission's nine-volume report, made public this morning, concludes that more than 60,000 people died or """"disappeared"""" in the guerrilla war that ravaged Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. """"These figures far exceed previous estimates,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch´s Americas Division. """"They reveal the utter brutality of the insurgency in Peru, as well as the repressiveness of the measures that were taken to contain it."""" Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group, killed about half the victims, and roughly one-third died at the hands of government security forces, according to the report. The commission attributed some of the other slayings to a smaller guerrilla group and local militias. The rest remain unattributed. The violence peaked in 1983 and 1984 in Ayacucho, one of Peru's poorest provinces. Both guerrillas and security forces massacred civilians indiscriminately. Three-quarters of the victims named in the report were Quechua-speaking Indians, the poorest and most exploited sector of Peruvian society. The commission will reportedly turn over a number of cases to the attorney general's office for prosecution. It did not name the suspected perpetrators, but recommended that their names be made public if Peru's attorney general fails to carry out prompt and exhaustive investigations of the cases. """"The real test of Peru's willingness to confront its abusive past lies in how the government handles the question of prosecutions,"""" Vivanco said. """"The world will be watching to see if the attorney general puts the necessary effort into investigating and prosecuting these cases."""" President Valentín Paniagua formed the Commission of Truth and Reconciliation in June 2001. Its mandate was threefold: to provide an official record of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed between May 1980 and November 2000; to analyze their causes, and to recommend measures to strengthen human rights and democracy. The commission collected 17,000 testimonies and interviewed political leaders, legislators, army generals and former guerrilla leaders now in prison. It also held public hearings in regions of the country most affected by the conflict. The hearings were broadcast on television. The report identified more than 1,000 sites thought to contain victims' bodies. It urged the government to provide more resources to enable the prosecutor's office to exhume and identify remains.

The charges against Ibrahim include “communicating with foreign human rights organizations.” “These charges testify to the poor state of political freedoms in Egypt today,” said Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa Division. “The emergency laws under which these men were charged are so broad and vague that they allow the government to criminalize virtually any manner of political dissent at will.” The five activists are charged with spreading false information about Egypt abroad and membership in a banned “revolutionary socialist group.” The indictment also accuses Ibrahim of “sending false information to foreign bodies—foreign human rights organizations—which include, contrary to the truth, violations of human rights within the country.” “This blatant attempt to punish peaceful dissent and intimidate others unfortunately demonstrates what constitutes the truth when it comes to exercising political rights in Egypt today,” said Stork. Ibrahim, an opponent of the US-led war in Iraq, has been jailed since he turned himself into the authorities on April 19 following a police raid on his home. The other four co-defendants went into hiding when the indictments were announced on August 7. They are Nasr Farouq al- Bahiri, a researcher for the Cairo-based Land Center for Human Rights; Yahya Fikri Amin Zahra, an engineer; Mustafa Muhammad al-Basiuni, unemployed, and Remon Edward Gindi Morgan, a student. The case has been referred to a Higher Emergency State Security Court. These tribunals, created under the emergency law, allow no appeal to a higher judicial body; their verdicts can only be overturned or modified by the president of the republic. Article 80 (d) of Egypt’s Penal Code carries a prison sentence of up to five years on any Egyptian who “deliberately discloses abroad false or tendentious news, information, or rumors about the country’s internal situation,” or who “carries out any activity aimed at damaging the national interest of the country.” The defendants were also charged under Article 86 bis of the Penal Code, passed in a package of anti-terrorist legislation in 1992; it punishes anyone who founds or joins an organization or association “impairing the national unity or social peace.”","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

We are concerned that Ibrahim, and four other defendants who have been charged in this case but not yet detained, are being persecuted for attempting to exercise their basic rights to freedom of expression, and association, and to receive and share information concerning the defense of human rights and freedoms. We are particularly disturbed that these five defendants will be subjected to a trial that violates internationally recognized standards of due process.   We urge you to take immediate steps to ensure that Ashraf Ibrahim is released without delay, and that the charges against him and the four other defendants are dropped. We also urge your government to repeal or amend those provisions of Egypt's penal code, specifically articles 80 (d) and 86 bis, in order to bring Egyptian laws into compliance with Egypt's international human rights obligations. Finally, we urge that you seek the repeal of Egypt's emergency rule legislation and the attendant system of Emergency State Security courts.   The Prosecutor General's referral of these defendants to a Higher Emergency State Security Court can only be taken as confirmation that your government uses these courts primarily to punish political activism and dissent, even when that dissent is peaceful. The Higher Emergency State Security Courts are a product of the state of emergency under which Egypt has been governed, with only sporadic interruption, since the passage of Law No. 162 of 1958. That law, which gives the government extensive powers to suspend basic liberties, including arresting suspects at will and detaining them without trial for prolonged periods, permits the referral of civilians to military or exceptional state security courts. The government's use of Emergency State Security Courts, a parallel judicial system highly susceptible to government influence with no right to appeal to a higher judicial body, violates article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees to every defendant the right to trial before a competent, independent, and impartial court, as well as the right to judicial review of verdicts.   State Security agents raided Ashraf Ibrahim's home, in his absence, on April 17, 2003. They seized his computer and other electronic equipment and papers, after searching the premises without presenting a warrant. (Reportedly, the warrant ultimately produced in the case file was actually dated April 18.) On April 19, Ashraf Ibrahim surrendered himself to State Security Investigations. He has been jailed since, and is now in Mahkoum Tora prison. For over three and one-half months, State Security prosecutors regularly renewed his detention without calling witnesses for questioning or preferring formal charges. During his interrogations, prosecutors reportedly told Ibrahim that he was being investigated for downloading information on human rights from the Internet and downloading material from the website of the al-Jazeera news service. On July 30, Ashraf Ibrahim began a hunger strike to protest the prolongation of his detention. No doctor visited him for the first five days of his hunger strike; the office of the prosecutor, mandated by law to confirm and monitor hunger strikes, did not visit him until the seventh day. During his hunger strike, Ibrahim was reportedly held in an inadequately ventilated and vermin-infested punishment cell, in solitary confinement. While he has reportedly abandoned his hunger strike now that charges have been brought, Human Rights Watch remains extremely concerned about his state of health, and urges that Ibrahim be transferred immediately to a facility that can provide him with appropriate medical care and that independent medical experts be allowed to visit him to evaluate his physical and mental condition.   On August 14, prosecutors pressed charges against Ibrahim and also against four other defendants: Nassir Faruq al-Bihiri, a researcher for the Land Center for Human Rights; Yahya Fikri Amin Zahra, an engineer; Mustafa Muhammad al-Basiuni, unemployed; and Remon Edward Gindi Morgan, a student. All defendants were charged under article 80 (d) of the Penal Code, which imposes a prison sentence of up to five years on any Egyptian who """"deliberately discloses abroad false or tendentious news, information, or rumors about the country's internal situation,"""" or who """"carries out any activity aimed at damaging the national interest of the country."""" They were also charged under article 86 bis of the Penal Code, which punishes anyone who founds or joins an organization or association """"the purpose of which is to call by any method for interrupting the provisions of the constitution or laws, or preventing any of the state's institutions or public authorities from carrying out their duties, or encroaching on the personal freedom of citizens or other freedoms and public rights as guaranteed by the constitution or the law, or impairing the national unity or social peace."""" Specifically, the first three defendants were accused of """"holding leadership as members of the steering committee of the revolutionary socialists' group,"""" while the fourth and fifth defendants are charged with joining such a group. Ashraf Ibrahim is also accused of """"holding and possessing publications disseminating advocacy and propaganda for the group's purposes,"""" and of """"sending false information to foreign bodies-foreign human rights organizations-which include, contrary to the truth, violations of human rights within the country, the content of which weakened the position of the state.""""   These charges, and the provisions under which they are pressed, clearly violate the basic rights of these individuals and endanger fundamental freedoms. The breadth and vagueness of the laws in question place most forms of peaceful dissent from government policy under the pall of potential criminality. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Egypt became a party in 1982, guarantees, in its article 19, the right to freedom of expression, including """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media."""" It guarantees the rights of assembly and association in its articles 21 and 22. The prosecution of these defendants for their alleged political expression and activity egregiously violates all these provisions.   Particularly disturbing is the charge that Ashraf Ibrahim communicated with """"foreign human rights organizations."""" The right to receive and share information concerning human rights is essential not only to the defense of individual liberties but to the functioning and survival of civil society. The United Nations' Declaration on Human Rights Defenders (adopted by the General Assembly in 1999) holds, in its article 5, that """"Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels: (a) To meet or assemble peacefully; (b) To form, join and participate in non-governmental organizations, associations or groups; (c) To communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations."""" It also guarantees, under article 6, the right """"to know, seek, obtain, receive and hold information about all human rights and fundamental freedoms;"""" """" to publish, impart or disseminate to others views, information and knowledge on all human rights and fundamental freedoms;"""" and """"to study, discuss, form and hold opinions on the observance, both in law and in practice, of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and, through these and other appropriate means, to draw public attention to those matters"""". The charge against Ashraf Ibrahim flouts all these principles.   Egypt's emergency legislation, which must be renewed every three years, had been due to expire in May 2003. Your government employed its overwhelming majority in the People's Assembly to force its early renewal on February 23, with little warning and only a day's debate. Since that time, your government has proposed, and the People's Assembly has approved, the elimination of State Security Courts created under Law 105 of 1980. However, the elimination of these courts leaves unchecked the operation of Emergency State Security Courts, whose verdicts are not subject to judicial appeal and can only be reviewed by the office of the president of the republic.  We urge you therefore to use your authority to ensure that the government immediately ends the prosecution of Ashraf Ibrahim, Nassir Faruq al-Bihiri, Yahya Fikri Amin Zahra, Mustafa Muhammad al-Basiuni, and Remon Edward Gindi Morgan for their attempts to exercise their fundamental rights to association and expression. Human Rights Watch also urges your government to repeal or amend articles 80(d) and 86 bis of the Penal Code to ensure that Egyptian laws are in compliance with international human rights provisions protecting the freedoms of expression and association, and the rights to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas. Human Rights Watch also urges your government to repeal Law No. 162 of 1958, and to bring to an end the state of emergency and the attendant system of Emergency State Security Courts.  We look forward to your response regarding these important matters.   Sincerely, Joe Stork Washington Director Middle East & North Africa Division","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/08/26/ukraine-women-facing-job-discrimination","Ukraine- Women Facing Job Discrimination","Ukraine: Women Facing Job Discrimination","","08/26/2003","Gender discrimination in Ukraine is cutting women out of the work force while the Ukrainian government is doing nothing to stop the problem, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today. ( in Ukrainian ) The fifty-two-page report, """"Women's Work: Discrimination Against Women in the Ukrainian Labor Force,"""" describes how Ukrainian employers discriminate against women job seekers in the way they announce vacancies and interview applicants. Both government agencies and private businesses regularly request male applicants more frequently than females in their job advertisements. Employers also use information on women's family circumstances-which they require the women to give during interviews-to deny women employment. Age and appearance requirements also exclude many women from jobs for which they are professionally qualified. """"The job market in Ukraine reflects some highly archaic stereotypes about women's capabilities,"""" said LaShawn Jefferson, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Women's Rights Division. """"The government of Ukraine can't claim to be a protector of women's rights while letting them be consigned to the lowest-paying, lowest-prestige jobs."""" Government officials routinely deny that discrimination against women in the labor force is a problem in Ukraine. But Ministry of Labor inspectors lack the will and the training to investigate discriminatory recruitment practices. Meanwhile, the State Employment Service endorses such discrimination by posting vacancy announcements with gender specifications, and even requesting gender-specific vacancy information from employers. The Ukrainian government has signed several international treaties outlawing job discrimination against women. They include the Convention Against All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and the International Labor Organization's Discrimination Convention No. 111. Gender-specific job advertising in Ukraine appears in newspapers, employment magazines, and Internet employment sites. State employment centers, private recruiting firms and job-placement agencies routinely distribute such advertisements. Vacancy announcements with requirements such as """"young woman from 18 to 30, attractive appearance"""" are common. Gender specifications can be found for all categories of jobs. Advertisements for blue-collar work involving physical labor as well as announcements for salaried mid- to upper-level managerial positions request male applicants much more frequently than female. The majority of advertisements specifying """"woman"""" can be found among service sector positions-such as wait staff and domestic help-as well as for lower-wage and non-supervisory professional positions as secretaries and accountants. As a result, women are dissuaded from even attempting to apply for many jobs that match their professional skills and qualifications. Discrimination in job interviews is also endemic and, for women job seekers, can be grueling and humiliating. Employers readily question women in interviews and on job applications about their age, marital status, family situation, family plans, and their husband's employment. Then employers make hiring decisions based on this personal information. For example, employers often deny young women work because, as they tell the women, they are of an age to be raising children. Women over thirty-five also encounter significant obstacles to employment, since the majority of jobs advertised for women, including as secretaries, caregivers, and waitresses, are typically deemed """"appropriate"""" only for young women. Employers regularly specify age requirements in vacancy announcements and may deny a woman employment upon learning her age during an interview. To address pervasive employment discrimination against women in Ukraine, today Human Rights Watch called on the Ukrainian government to: Publicly condemn discrimination against women in all recruitment practices, including job advertising.  Ensure that state agencies do not conduct discriminatory recruitment practices and cease the use of gender-specific job advertising. Enact legislation to eliminate gender restrictions on parental benefits, with the exception of time off for childbirth.  In conjunction with non-governmental organizations, trade unions, employer groups and others, conduct national education campaigns to raise awareness of discrimination and sexual harassment in employment among women job seekers, employers, public officials, and civil servants, and to raise awareness about official remedies available to injured parties. Human Rights Watch also appealed to international organizations to take bolder steps in promoting non-discrimination with the Ukrainian government. In particular, Human Rights Watch urged the United States government and others to include employer and employee anti-discrimination education components to aid programs aimed at promoting women's rights and combating trafficking in human beings. Human Rights Watch called on the European Union (EU) to assist the Ukrainian government in harmonizing its legislation to meet EU standards on nondiscrimination and equal treatment in employment and asked the International Labor Organization (ILO) to provide additional training to government officials, including labor ministry inspectors, on gender specific labor rights issues and investigative techniques.","Europe/Central Asia, Ukraine","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Child Labor, Domestic Workers"

Pham, 35, is one of three Vietnamese writers chosen to receive prestigious Hellman/Hammett grants this year. He was sentenced to 13 years' imprisonment and three years of house arrest after a trial in June 2003 that did not meet international fair trial standards. Vietnam's Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Pham's appeal in Hanoi on Tuesday, August 26. According to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, all international observers will be barred from the proceedings, including foreign diplomats and Western journalists. """"Pham Hong Son's first trial was a sham,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Supreme Court should do better, by admitting international observers and resisting political directives predetermining the verdict."""" Outside observers were also barred from Pham's first trial, despite written requests to attend. The sole witness called was Pham's wife, who was only allowed to answer two """"yes"""" or """"no"""" questions. """"The defense lawyers will have their hands tied by the political nature of this case,"""" Adams said. """"Political cases in Vietnam are invariably decided long before the opening of the hearing."""" Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Vietnam is party, states that everyone has the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. Defendants must be permitted to have adequate facilities to prepare a defense and present witnesses on their behalf. Pham Hong Son was arrested in March 2002 for using the Internet to communicate with colleagues abroad and disseminate pro-democracy articles such as """"What is Democracy"""" and """"Hopeful Signs for Democracy in Vietnam."""" Earlier, police had interrogated Pham and searched his home, confiscating documents and his computer. Two days after he published an open letter on the Internet protesting the confiscation of his belongings, he disappeared. It was more than a week before his family learned that he had been arrested, without a warrant. The indictment charges Pham with spying because he """"took the initiative"""" to communicate by telephone and e-mail with """"political opportunists"""" in Vietnam and abroad, and used email to """"translate and send anti-Party and anti-government documents"""" to colleagues abroad. It did not state what country Pham Hong Son was allegedly spying for. He is the fifth dissident in the past year to be arrested and charged with crimes relating to e-mail communication or other Internet activity. """"Jailing writers and cyber-dissidents shows Hanoi's complete intolerance for any sort of peaceful dissent and has a chilling effect on all debate in Vietnam,"""" said Adams. """"Government attempts to control the Internet will increasingly become a problem as Internet use grows in Vietnam."""" Human Rights Watch also expressed concern that Pham's wife, Vu Thuy Ha, could be arrested herself. She is currently under surveillance by local authorities. Since Pham's arrest in March 2002, she has only been allowed to see him once. On July 5, 2003, the two were allowed to meet for 30 minutes, separated by a glass wall and speaking over a telephone. Pham Hong Son is among a diverse group of 28 writers from 13 countries who were selected for Hellman/Hammett grants this year in recognition of the courage with which they have faced political persecution. The two other honorees from Vietnam this year are Nguyen Thi Thanh Xuan and Vu Cao Quan. Short biographies of the three Vietnamese writers who received grants in 2003 follow. Pham Hong Son graduated from medical school but left the profession to take an MBA course and work as a manager for pharmaceutical companies. In 2001, he decided to commit himself to the struggle for democracy and began writing and translating articles that are circulated by hand and posted on various websites of the Vietnamese diaspora. He also sent copies to Vietnamese leaders, and in January 2002, he wrote an open letter to the Secretary General of the Vietnamese Communist Party arguing that Vietnam was ready for democracy. Officials advised him to stop mixing in politics but he refused. On March 27, 2002, he was arrested and charged with espionage for communicating via email with dissidents abroad and using the Internet to send allegedly subversive documents. After a half-day closed trial in Hanoi on June 18, 2003, Pham Hong Son was sentenced to 13 years in prison and three years of house arrest. Visits from his wife have been largely forbidden.  Nguyen Thi Thanh Xuan, social science researcher, co-authored three books based on discussions at meetings she and a colleague organized to discuss national issues. The books in turn supplied material for political debates. At first, Nguyen Thi Thanh Xuan was praised as an """"enlightened intellectual,"""" but as the debates turned critical of the Vietnamese Communist Party, she was denounced as extremist and reactionary. She was arrested in August 2001. She was soon released but remains closely watched. Her telephone line has been cut and friends are discouraged by local authorities from visiting her. Vu Cao Quan joined the Vietnamese Communist Party in 1962 and was expelled in 1999 after writing a series of articles criticizing communist party policies and advocating human rights and democracy. In April 2001, he was arrested and detained for nine days after organizing a meeting of dissidents in Hai Phong City. He was arrested again in September 2001 after joining the Anti-Corruption Association but released after one day. Vu Cao Quan is currently under unofficial house arrest, closely watched and isolated. He can no longer earn a living because no company will take the risk to hire him.","Asia, Vietnam",""

On June 12, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1487, exempting any peacekeepers from the court's jurisdiction who come from states that have not ratified the International Criminal Court founding treaty.     On August 1, the U.S. government insisted on including a paragraph in a resolution that authorized a peacekeeping force for Liberia that provided immunity for peacekeepers serving in that country.

But this can only happen if he is put on trial before a tribunal that is fair, impartial and independent. And for that to happen, the United States will have to reconsider its perverse aversion to an accountability process that involves the international community. Ali Hassan earned the sobriquet “Chemical Ali” following Iraq´s murderous chemical weapons attacks ­ “special bombardments” was the term he used in his directives ­ against at least 60 Kurdish villages between April 1987 and August 1988, including the attack on the town of Halabja that alone killed some 5,000 people. But that was not all. As head of the Baath Party´s Northern Bureau at the time, he was the architect of the notorious Anfal campaign of 1988, in which more than 100,000 Kurds were killed or “disappeared.” Subsequently Ali Hassan al-Majid was in charge of suppressing the mass anti-government uprising in the largely Shiite south in March 1991. In retaking the southern cities, loyalist forces under his overall command fired indiscriminately into residential areas, executed people on the streets and arrested and made “disappear” thousands. Taha Yassin Ramadan, the former vice-president who was taken into custody earlier this week, also played a leading role in that campaign. Iraqis now know what they long suspected: that almost all of those Kurds and Shiites who disappeared ended up in mass graves, a good number of which have been uncovered in recent months. One survivor from a 1991 massacre near the southern city of Al-Hilla, Nasser Khadi Hashim al-Husseini, was 12 years old at the time. He told my colleagues at Human Rights Watch this May how security forces rounded up people, held them for several days, then loaded them onto buses and drove them to a remote abandoned canal. They pulled the people off the buses, threw them into a specially dug pit, machine-gunned them and buried them with a bulldozer. Nasir al-Husseini survived the shooting and managed to crawl to a spot where he could breathe through some bamboo covering until night fell and he could escape. Another witness, Hassan Muhsin al-Ardawi, described a month of daily executions near the Al-Mahawil military base in the Al-Hilla area, the site of another mass grave from 1991. “They used to take them from the cars and push them in the holes, their hands tied and eyes covered,” he said. “They used to hit them, they had no mercy … they would just start to shoot them. After they were killed they buried them using the bulldozer shovels.” The capture of Chemical Ali highlights the failure of the US-led occupation to adequately prepare for bringing to justice those Iraqi leaders responsible for these atrocities. The Iraqi governing council appointed by US civil administrator Paul Bremer has a role to play, but the “Iraqi-led process” that the Bush administration invokes does not yet exist, and any tribunal established solely under US auspices will smack of vengeful “victor´s justice.” That´s why a tribunal should be established in Iraq using Arabic and Kurdish as official languages, and be presided over by Iraqi judges and judges from other countries ­ not just the United States. Few if any Iraqi judges, prosecutors and investigators have participated in cases as complex as those involving war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. Technical expertise is needed for conducting focused investigations, analyzing documentary and forensic evidence, deposing witnesses, and so forth. All this will require tapping into the experience of the international ad hoc tribunals prosecuting similar crimes in Rwanda, Sierra Leone and the former Yugoslavia. Veterans of these efforts should be invited to help set up, along with Iraqis, a “group of experts” who can coordinate evidence collection and preservation and recommend the most appropriate mechanisms to bring former officials to account for these serious crimes. Ali Hassan al-Majid issued the world a challenge in 1988. On an audiotape of a meeting of leading Iraqi officials held to discuss the Anfal campaign, he is heard shouting, “I will kill them all with chemical weapons. Who is going to say anything?” The time has come for Iraqis and the international community together to provide the answer to his question.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

Zouari was arrested after he assisted a Human Rights Watch research mission in the south of Tunisia. Zouari, currently in Harboub prison, has faced constant harassment since he completed an 11-year prison sentence in June 2002. The original sentence included an additional five years of “administrative control,” and after his release the Ministry of Interior ordered him confined to the town of Zarzis in a remote southern region far from his family in Tunis. Zouari’s appeal of that order is still pending. Zouari was arrested on August 17 in Ben Guerdane, a market town near Zarzis. He is scheduled to appear before the cantonal judge on Friday, August 22, on charges of leaving Zarzis without obtaining police permission. But that does not appear to be the only reason. Although police had reportedly warned him not to contact foreign media and rights workers, in early August, Zouari helped a Human Rights Watch researcher visiting southern Tunisia meet with victims of rights abuses. Their movements were monitored by men in plainclothes who were apparently police. “The real reason for Zouari’s arrest is his unflagging determination to fight for his own rights and the rights of others,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Any Tunisian who dares to criticize the lack of political freedoms under President Ben Ali knows to expect harassment or worse, but the risk is doubled for a former political prisoner. Abdullah Zouari must be released from prison and allowed to live and work where he wishes, and to speak without restriction.” Zouari wrote for Al-Fajr, a now-defunct publication linked to the banned Nahdha (Renaissance) party, and served 11 years in prison for “membership in an illegal organization.” He was released in June 2002, but convicted again two months later and sentenced to eight months in prison for violating his administrative control order. Zouari served only two months of that sentence before his release in November 2002 for “humanitarian reasons.” Last month, Zouari was convicted and sentenced to four months in prison for “libel” after a dispute with the owner of an Internet café who Zouari said denied him entry. Zouari has appealed that decision also.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

""""The capture of 'Chemical Ali' presents a rare opportunity to bring a measure of justice to the countless victims and their families who suffered under Ba'ath Party rule,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program. """"International participation is essential for fair trials that will expose his crimes before independent and impartial courts."""" Al-Majid, a cousin of Saddam Hussein, masterminded the genocidal 1988 campaign that resulted in the murder or """"disappearance"""" of some 100,000 Kurds. He led the forces that suppressed the popular uprising in southern Iraq in March 1991, and reportedly played a principal role in a killing and repression campaign against Iraq's Marsh Arab population during the 1990s. Prosecuting Iraq's former leaders -- including former Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, captured earlier this week -- will pose significant challenges, Human Rights Watch said. Trials will require technical expertise in conducting focused investigations, classifying and analyzing evidence, and developing a prosecution strategy. Few judges, prosecutors, or investigators in Iraq have participated in cases as complex as those involving genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. The United States and its coalition partners have thus far failed to address the needs that will arise from trying senior leaders in the former Iraqi government for serious past crimes. Coalition forces have been slow to secure mass grave sites, resulting in the destruction of substantial evidence. The Coalition Provisional Authority has also failed to indicate what it intends to do with the 37 senior former Iraqi governing officials currently in custody. To date, none has had access to family or legal counsel. """"The trials of Iraq's former leaders should have international participation to avoid the perception of vengeful 'victors' justice,'"""" Dicker said. """"The United Nations and the Iraqi Governing Council should work together to achieve this."""" The trials could be held in Iraq, using Arabic and Kurdish as their official languages and presided over by Iraqi and international judges applying the relevant provisions of Iraqi and international law, Human Rights Watch said. It called on the Iraqi governing council and the United Nations to support creating either mixed or international tribunals soon. BACKGROUND Who is Ali Hassan al-Majid (""""Chemical Ali"""")? Al-Majid is widely known in Iraq as """"Chemical Ali"""" for his repeated use of outlawed chemical warfare, as documented in the Human Rights Watch book on that campaign, Genocide In Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds. He was later in charge of Iraq's brutal military occupation of Kuwait, and commanded Iraq's military forces in the south. As secretary general of the Northern Bureau of Iraq's Ba'ath Party, al-Majid held authority over all agencies of the state in the Kurdish region from March 1987 to April 1989, including the 1st and 5th Corps of the army, the General Security Directorate, and Military Intelligence. This included the period of the Anfal genocide against the region's Kurdish residents. One of his orders, dated June 20, 1987, directed army commanders """"to carry out special bombardments [a reference to chemical weapon use]...to kill the largest number of persons present in ...prohibited zones."""" Named after a Koranic verse justifying pillage of properties of infidels, the Anfal campaign unfolded as the 1980-1988 Iran/Iraq war was winding down. The Anfal campaign, under al-Majid's command, resulted in the murder and """"disappearance"""" of some 100,000 noncombatants, the use of chemical weapons against noncombatants in dozens of locations, and the near-total destruction of family and community assets, including agricultural and other infrastructure, throughout the rural Kurdish areas. Documents captured from Iraqi intelligence services demonstrate that the mass killings, """"disappearances,"""" forced displacement, and other crimes were carried out in a coherent and highly centralized manner under al-Majid's direct supervision. Ali Hassan al-Majid was subsequently in charge of Iraq's military occupation of Kuwait and led forces that suppressed the popular uprising in the south of the country in March 1991. All of these campaigns were marked by executions, arbitrary arrests, """"disappearances,"""" torture, and other atrocities. According to Iraqi opposition activists and refugee testimony, al-Majid played a leading role in the campaign against Iraq's Marsh Arab population in the 1990s. Numbering some 250,000 people as recently as 1991, the Marsh Arabs as of January 2003 were believed to number fewer than 40,000 in their ancestral homeland. Many were arrested, """"disappeared,"""" or executed; most have become refugees abroad or are internally displaced in Iraq as a result of al-Majid's campaign. Who is Taha Yassin Ramadan? Taha Yassin Ramadan (formerly Taha Jazrawi) was Saddam Hussein's vice president. He has been a member of the ruling Revolutionary Command Council since 1969, shortly after the Ba'ath Party took power in Iraq. In 1970, he sat on a special court that sentenced 42 people to immediate execution for their alleged roles in a coup attempt against the government. He later headed the Ba'ath Party paramilitary force known as the Popular Army, which reportedly played an active role in suppressing the March 1991 popular uprising in southern Iraq. That campaign, brutal in the extreme, was characterized by routine torture, numerous extrajudicial executions, and widespread arbitrary detentions and subsequent """"disappearances.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

The Full Stop Law prevented the hearing of cases filed with the courts after a deadline of 60 days. The Due Obedience Law granted automatic immunity to all members of the military except those in positions of command. The Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Argentine legislature, voted to annul the laws a week ago.

Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch said today. After meeting with China's top leaders on August 18-19 in Beijing, Howard dismissed international efforts to pressure China on its human rights record and insisted that quiet diplomacy was producing sufficient results. In 1997, during a previous visit by Howard to Beijing, Australia agreed to begin a bilateral human rights dialogue with China and dropped its sponsorship of a U.N. resolution censuring China. Since that time, the United States and European Union have also failed to table resolutions critical of China. Australia is currently lobbying for election as chair of the Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations top human rights body that meets annually in Geneva. The rights record of countries seeking to chair the Commission has come under intense scrutiny following the controversy over Libya's election to the chairmanship last year. """"Howard's statements in China undermine Australia's claims to leadership on human rights,"""" said Rory Mungoven, Global Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"The experience in China shows that dialogue will not produce results without accompanying international pressure."""" Human Rights Watch highlighted a range of serious human rights concerns in China that contradicted Howard's claims of progress: increased arrests and police violence directed at HIV-positive protestors in Henan province and refusal of central authorities to bring to justice provincial authorities responsible for the transmission of HIV through unclean blood collection practices, which may have affected as many as one million people, and perhaps more; eight and ten-year prison terms for four young intellectuals, Yang Zili, Xu Wei, Jin Haike, and Zhang Honghai, who used the Internet to air their thoughts about competing political ideologies; a severely flawed and secretive judicial process that resulted in the execution of one Tibetan, Lobsang Dondrup, and a death sentence with a two-year suspension for another, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche; the sentencing of two workers, Yao Fuxin and Xiao Yunliang, to long prison terms for organizing workers to peacefully protest an allegedly corrupt bankruptcy proceeding that contributed to lost wages and pensions for thousands; use of the global war against terrorism as cover to discriminate against Muslims living in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region in matters of access to education and employment, and to restrict their rights to freedom of association, assembly, belief, and expression, and; China's unwillingness to honor its pledges to allow visits """"without conditions"""" by the U.N.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/08/20/womens-property-rights-kenyas-draft-constitution","Womens Property Rights in Kenyas Draft Constitution","Women's Property Rights in Kenya's Draft Constitution","A Joint Letter to Delegates of Kenya's National Constitutional Conference","08/20/2003","Nairobi   August 2003   To: Delegates of the National Constitutional Conference   Dear Delegates:   By enacting a new constitution, Kenya has the opportunity to lay a solid foundation for the legal protection of women's equal property rights. The constitutional review process constitutes an important opportunity to do away with problematic provisions of the current constitution, which permits discrimination when it comes to customary and personal laws that affect women's property rights.   Women's rights to own, inherit, and control property on an equal basis with men are violated in Kenya and in many other sub-Saharan African countries, contributing to poverty, homelessness, dispossession, disease (including HIV/AIDS), and violence. Many women are excluded from inheriting property, evicted from their homes when they divorce or their husbands die, stripped of their belongings, and sometimes forced into customary sexual behaviors, including """"wife inheritance"""" and ritual """"cleansing"""", in order to keep their property. These practices not only discriminate against women, they undermine Kenya's development and its fight against HIV/AIDS.   The draft constitution currently under review contains vital provisions that would protect the property rights of your mothers, sisters, daughters, and wives. Enacting the draft constitution would further bring Kenya into compliance with its international human rights obligations, including the rights to nondiscrimination and equality before the law. These rights and others relating to women's equal property rights are set forth in the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights-all of which Kenya has ratified.   The signatories to this letter represent a range of Kenyan and international organizations and experts that are deeply concerned about women's property rights violations. Individual women who have experienced such abuses have also signed this letter. We strongly support the language relating to women's property rights in the draft constitution. Together, we wish to urge the delegates to the National Constitutional Conference to take this historic opportunity to enshrine in law the equal property rights protections that women deserve.   The Current Constitution    The current constitution provides that all Kenyans are entitled to fundamental rights and freedoms, whatever their sex, and prohibits laws that discriminate on the basis of sex. However, article 82(4) exempts certain laws from the prohibition against discrimination. It permits discrimination """"with respect to adoption, marriage, divorce, burial, devolution of property on death or other matters of personal law"""" and with respect to """"the application in the case of members of a particular race or tribe of customary law with respect to any matter to the exclusion of any law with respect to that matter which is applicable in the case of other persons."""" Thus, in areas vital to women's property rights, such as marriage, inheritance, and the application of customary law, discrimination is condoned. In addition, article 82(6) provides that if an official body controlling transactions in agricultural land (such as a land control board) gives or withholds consent to a transaction, this decision may not be deemed discriminatory. In other words, if a land control board issues a decision permitting a man to sell family agricultural land, his wife cannot challenge that decision as discriminatory.       The New Draft Constitution    The draft constitution addresses many of the current constitution's shortcomings. If enacted and implemented, it would constitute a profound step forward for Kenyan women and their families and communities.   The draft constitution prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex and marital status in article 34(1), which provides:   Article 34 (Freedom from Discrimination)    (1) The state shall not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including race, sex, pregnancy, marital status, ethnic or social origin, colour, age, disability, religion, conscience, belief, culture, language or birth.   The draft constitution provides for equal rights relating to marriage and its dissolution. Article 38(4) provides:   Article 38 (The Family)    (4) [Parties] to a marriage are entitled to equal rights in the marriage, during the marriage, and at the dissolution of their marriage.   The draft constitution guarantees women's right to equal treatment with men, including equal rights to inherit, have access to, and control property and prohibits any law, culture, custom, or tradition that undermines women's dignity, welfare, interest, or status. Article 35 provides:   Article 35 (Women)    (1) Women have the right to equal treatment with men, including the right to equal opportunities in political, economic and social activities.   (2) Women are entitled to be accorded the same dignity of the person as men.   (3) Women and men have an equal right to inherit, have access to and control property.   (4) Any law, culture, custom or tradition that undermines the dignity, welfare, interest or status of women is prohibited.   (5) The state shall -   (a) protect women and their rights, taking into account their unique status and natural maternal role in society; and   (b) provide reasonable facilities and opportunities to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement.   The draft constitution guarantees every person the right to acquire and own property in article 54(1), which provides:   Article 54 (Property)    (1) Every person has a right to acquire and own property either individually or in association with others.   The draft constitution ensures that every person the right to adequate housing. Article 59 provides:   Article 59 (Housing)    (1) Every person has the right to have access to adequate housing.   (2) No person may be evicted from their home, or have their home demolished, without an order of court made after considering all the relevant circumstances.   (3) Parliament may not enact any law that permits or authorizes arbitrary eviction.   The draft constitution requires that parliament enact laws to protect matrimonial property and laws protecting spousal rights to inherit land. Article 235 provides:   Article 235 (Tenure of Land)    Within two years of the coming into force of this Constitution, Parliament shall -   (4)(a) enact law for - ...   (iv) the protection of dependants of deceased persons holding interests in any land including the interests of spouses in actual occupation of land.   (v) the recognition and protection of matrimonial property and in particular the matrimonial home during and at the termination of marriage.   There is, unfortunately, one notable drawback to the draft constitution with respect to women's property rights. That is the provision in article 31(4) of the draft constitution, which reads: """"The provisions of this chapter on equality shall be qualified to the extent strictly necessary for the application of Islamic law to persons who profess the Muslim faith in relation to personal status, marriage, divorce and inheritance."""" Thus, although the draft constitution would drastically improve most women's property rights, Muslim women would not be entitled to the full benefit of these constitutional rights. According to fundamental principles of human rights, constitutional protections should apply equally to women from all religions and ethnic groups. Such equal protection would be consistent with Kenya's international human rights treaty obligations to ensure equal treatment of men and women, and with the provision that """"a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty."""" (Article 27, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, 1969).   To better protect the rights of countless Kenyan women whose property rights have been violated or who are at risk of such abuse, we urge you to enshrine women's equal property rights unequivocally in Kenya's new constitution and to ensure effective enforcement of those rights.

""""The Cambodian government must demonstrate a commitment to justice, particularly in cases that may have political overtones,"""" said Sara Colm, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"Now that an arrest warrant has been issued, the test is whether the police will actually arrest the local official suspected of the crime."""" Khuon Dina was shot dead on the afternoon of August 6. She had been collecting scrap latex in the rubber plantations of Tbong Khmum District with her brother-in-law and four others. Several witnesses observed the plantation village chief of Opi village, Nguon Oum, approach quickly on his motorbike, chase Dina and the others, then open fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, shooting Dina twice. Two witnesses said that Ngoun Oum kicked Dina's body to ensure she was dead before he left the scene. Human rights investigators reported that earlier in the day Nguon had searched the area for Dina and her siblings. While local authorities attribute Dina's killing to a dispute over illegal latex collection, many residents believe the slaying was politically motivated. In addition, the Cambodian Human Rights Action Committee has stated that Dina's murder was a result of her father's political affiliation. Regardless of the motivations, Human Rights Watch condemns the killing. Local authorities had been harassing Dina's family since April, when her father, Chan Moni, became a local activist for the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP). On election day, July 27, police officers shouted at SRP activists including Chan Moni, who complained about alleged fraud at the polling station. Days before Dina's murder, Ngoun Oum threatened to shoot Dina's brother and beat her older sister for stealing rubber. When Chan Moni complained to Nguon Oum about this treatment, Nguon Oum also beat Chan Moni. Hours after the slaying, as Chan Moni and his friends were making funeral arrangements for Khuon Dina, a policeman from the rubber plantation approached them and tried to persuade Chan Moni not to file a formal complaint. """"The Cambodian government must instruct the police to act quickly to arrest Nguon Oum,"""" said Colm. """"Too often in Cambodia warrants do not get served and cases are quietly dropped.

The 51-page report, “Ravaging the Vulnerable: Abuses Against Persons at High Risk of HIV Infection in Bangladesh,” documents rapes, gang-rapes, beatings and abductions by both police officers and powerful criminals known as mastans. Their targets—sex workers, men who have sex with men and injection drug users—are both at high risk of HIV infection and the people most capable of bringing AIDS information and services to their peers. In a direct blow to the fight against AIDS, some of the abuses are committed against AIDS outreach workers. “Bangladesh is brutalizing exactly the people it most needs as allies if it is to avoid a severe AIDS epidemic,” said Vivek Maru, researcher with Human Rights Watch. “Violence against at-risk people traumatizes them and drives them out of reach of HIV prevention services, which can increase their risk of infection.” In one region of Bangladesh, HIV prevalence among injection drug users jumped from 1.7 percent in 2001 to 4 percent in 2002. While HIV prevalence in the population overall is reportedly still low, the country’s poverty, gender inequality, and proximity to raging epidemics in India and Southeast Asia point to the possibility of an AIDS explosion. “This is a critical moment,” said Maru. “Strong intervention now could save countless lives, but time may be running out.” Bangladesh acknowledged in late 2002 that the mastan problem was an enormous threat to the population at large and that the police were too corrupt and ineffective to control it. The government’s solution was to send the army into the streets. But “Operation Clean Heart” resulted in its own abuses, including at least 40 deaths in custody. Now the government is using the paramilitary “Bangladesh Rifles” to fight crime. “Military reinforcements are no substitute for systemic reform,” said Maru. “The reforms that can stop the attacks on people vulnerable to AIDS and help stave off an epidemic are the same reforms the country needs to resolve its crisis of law and order.” Human Rights Watch urged Bangladesh to institute civilian review of police officers, to prosecute police and mastans who perpetrate abuses, to bring its criminal procedures in line with international standards, and to support peer-driven AIDS prevention services among persons at high risk of HIV.","Asia, Bangladesh","Health, Women's Rights, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

President Akaev has vowed not to run for office again in the next elections, scheduled for 2005, and many observers are watching the government’s treatment of its political opponents as an indication of its commitment to a fair election process. “Feliks Kulov is a political prisoner and should be released,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “Kulov’s continuing imprisonment is not a promising sign for future elections.” Kyrgyzstan officials worked to exclude Kulov from the ballot in the October 2000 presidential elections. The National Security Service (SNB, formerly the KGB) arrested Kulov, head of the Ar-Namys (Dignity) party, on March 29, 2000 on trumped-up charges of abuse of office related to his tenure as head of the SNB. A military tribunal acquitted Kulov in August 2000. But the prosecutor's office appealed the acquittal, and one month later—just after Kulov announced his intent to run against Akaev in the presidential elections—police arrested him again. A court sentenced Kulov to seven years of imprisonment in January 2001; new charges of embezzlement were added in July, and the sentence was increased to ten years. Kulov is Kyrgyzstan’s most high-profile political prisoner. In addition to serving as SNB chief and as the country’s vice president, he was also governor of the Chui province, and mayor of Bishkek, the nation's capital. Prior to his arrest in 2000, he lost his bid for a seat in parliament due in part to interference by local authorities. Kyrgyzstan’s Manas airbase is host to military partners in the U.S.-led anti-terrorism coalition; the Akaev government has received financial assistance and increased prestige in the region as reward for its cooperation. President Akaev met with U.S. President Bush at the White House in September 2002. “The U.S. government and its partners in anti-terror operations need to remind Kyrgyzstan that respect for human rights and democracy are an integral part of establishing security,” said Andersen. “Calling for Kulov’s release should be part of this process.”","Europe/Central Asia, Kyrgyzstan",""

Along with the Military Police, these security forces killed approximately 10,000 Ugandans in Amin's first year. Over the next few years, many more Ugandans fell prey to Amin's henchmen, sought sanctuary in neighboring countries, or went into hiding in Uganda. A report by the New York City Bar Association's Committee on International Human Rights estimated the number of victims of Amin's reign of terror between 100,000 and 500,000. Many prominent Ugandans lost their lives during Amin's regime, including Chief Justice Benedicto Kiwanuka and Anglican archbishop Janani Luwuum. In 1972, Amin ordered the expulsion of Uganda's 70,000 citizens of Asian origin and the expropriation of their extensive property holdings, including 5,655 firms, factories, and farms and U.S. $400 million in personal goods.","Africa, Uganda","International Justice"

The 29-page report, “Struggling Through Peace: Return and Resettlement in Angola,” documents several incidents of government authorities using violence, or the threat of violence, to drive people out of camps where they had been living sometimes for years. The Human Rights Watch report also raises concerns about reported incidents of rape and other sexual violence against internally displaced women and returning refugees. “The end of the conflict in Angola is a blessing for millions of Angolans who can now return home,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “But unless urgent measures are taken to stop these abuses, peace will be a curse instead.” Hundreds of Angolan refugees have spontaneously returned to their homes since the ceasefire of April 2002, but millions of internally displaced people, refugees and ex-combatants remain in exile, in transit or in temporary resettlement sites within Angola. Rather than paying special attention to children, women, and vulnerable groups, the Angolan government has granted preference to ex-combatants for resettlement. The government has also failed to provide people with identity documents that would help them get access to humanitarian assistance, which is in any case inadequate. “Angola is an oil-rich state with the resources to help its people,” said Takirambudde. “There´s no excuse for the way they have been suffering.” Angolan law has incorporated international standards on the protection of the displaced, but the government has failed to respect that law in practice, Human Rights Watch charged. Landmines have killed or maimed hundreds as they have tried to return home, Human Rights Watch said. """"U.N. agencies have also failed to take effective steps to ensure the protection of Angolans from human rights violations. Human Rights Watch urged the High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and U.N. Human Rights Division in Angola to increase their outreach to vulnerable groups whom the Angolan government has ignored in resettlement efforts. Human Rights Watch also appealed to the donor community to fully fund the U.N. interagency appeal for Angola. The Human Rights Watch report urges the Angolan government and international agencies to ensure reasonably uniform conditions in the areas to which the internally displaced, refugees, and former combatants will return, and to pay special attention to the needs of women, children and other vulnerable groups. Most importantly, the Angolan government must respect international and domestic law requiring the voluntary basis on which displaced people should be resettled. Findings: Forced Return Human Rights Watch found that local authorities have forced internally displaced Angolans to return to their home areas by violence or threat of violence. One such incident occurred in transit center Cambabe II, in Bengo Province. Local administration and police forces entered the camp in September and October 2002, and burned the internally displaced Angolans´ homes and 10 acres of crops. With their homes and crops destroyed, the displaced people had nowhere to go except their home areas, which were not ready to receive them. Most fled immediately, without stopping to gather the animals or possessions that had survived the fire. One Angolan humanitarian worker who was present at Cambabe II and witnessed the burning of the displaced persons´ homes, told Human Rights Watch: They were forced to leave the area because the Government wanted to have the land for its own agricultural projects. The [internally displaced] lost ten acres of crops—sweet potatoes and manioc. Burning houses was part of the Government´s policy. In another case, the government threatened to suspend assistance to people in the camps they had been living in for many years. Another humanitarian worker reported: Local administration determined that the camps [at Bengo II] had to be emptied. They told us that the return process was officially open and people should go back to their areas of origin. However, they did not provide transportation or other assistance and they threatened to suspend current assistance. And then, in July 2002, there was a general embarrassment, when WFP food distribution was temporarily suspended in Bengo and Feira [transit centers]. Marlene V., 28, told Human Rights Watch that local authorities instructed her family to leave Bengo II and go to Sanza Pombo (their place of origin), even though they wanted to remain at Bengo II. She said: I don´t have any one there. My mother and father passed away and my children are going to school here [in Negage]. In Sanza Pombo there are no health centers or other services. My husband went there and told me so. In Bengo II, there were about 12 families from Sanza Pombo that did not wish to return. Jorge S., 33, told Human Rights Watch their reasons for remaining: We have been here since September 1999. Here we have a house and land to work on. ‘Return´ means go to a place where roads don´t even go. In other cases, displaced people have been prevented from moving where they want to go, in particular to Luanda, the capital city. Helena S., 29, a displaced woman interviewed by Human Rights Watch in Uíge, where she had been living as a displaced person for years, told us that local authorities had been preventing her from moving on to Luanda, where five of her children and other family members were living. She told a Human Rights Watch researcher: I have not seen my mother for seven years. We were separated during the war. I am from Mbanza Kongo. Here [in Negage] I don´t have land. I don´t have anything. I have five children in Luanda and two here with me. I wanted to go to Luanda where I have family but they told us to wait. I have been waiting for ten months.

The Full Stop Law prevented the hearing of cases filed with the courts after a deadline of 60 days. The Due Obedience Law granted automatic immunity to all members of the military except those in positions of command. The chamber also voted by an overwhelming majority to give constitutional status to the U.N. Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity, which Argentina had ratified Monday. And it passed a bill to amend national legislation barring impunity for this type of crime. The bills now move to the Senate, which is expected to ratify them. An estimated 15,000 people “disappeared” when Argentina was under military rule from 1976 to 1983. The “impunity laws,” as the two laws are known in Argentina, were rushed through Congress in 1986 and 1987 by the government of Raúl Alfonsín in order to quell a military rebellion by officers angered at human rights trials. The only crime they could be prosecuted for was baby snatching; the theft of babies born to mothers held in secret detention and subsequently killed was considered too abhorrent to absolve. During the 1990s human rights groups campaigned and litigated to ensure that judicial investigations into “disappearances” and other human rights crimes continued, even though prosecution was barred. Federal judges declared the laws unconstitutional in 2001, and the rulings have been appealed up to the Supreme Court. Since he took office on May 25, President Néstor Kirchner has insisted that those who violated human rights during military rule should be held accountable. On July 25, he repealed a decree that prevented the extradition of Argentines to stand trial in other countries. That clears the way for Spain to proceed with plans to seek the extradition of 45 former members of the Argentine security forces and one civilian for human rights violations.

The 77-page report, """"Just Die Quietly: Domestic Violence and Women's Vulnerability to HIV in Uganda,"""" documents widespread rape and brutal attacks on women by their husbands in Uganda, where a specific domestic violence law has not been enacted and where spousal rape is not criminalized. """"The Ugandan government's failure to address domestic violence is costing women their lives,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Any success Uganda has experienced in its fight against HIV/AIDS will be short-lived if the government does not address this urgent problem."""" Many women told Human Rights Watch that a fear of violent repercussions impeded their access to HIV/AIDS information, HIV testing, and HIV/AIDS treatment and counseling. Lydia Mpachibi (not her real name), a thirty-five-year old, HIV-positive widow living in Tororo, in eastern Uganda told Human Rights Watch that while her husband was alive she avoided HIV/AIDS testing or information because she was afraid that he would evict her. """"I wouldn't dare because if I was HIV-positive he would say I brought the virus into the home,"""" Mpachibi said. """"I have seen very many women being chased away by their husbands...I was scared of being thrown out."""" The Human Rights Watch report says that HIV/AIDS programs focusing on fidelity, abstinence, and condom use do not account for the ways in which domestic violence inhibits women's control over sexual matters in marriage. The U.S. government has proposed a dramatic increase in such programs as a way of combating AIDS in Africa. Programs focusing on fidelity, abstinence, and condom use minimize the complex causes of violence, and incorrectly assume that women have equal decision-making power and status within the family. """"Being married should not be a death sentence for Ugandan women,"""" said Jefferson. """"Women should not have to give up their rights to physical security and sexual autonomy just because they get married."""" Human Rights Watch urged the Ugandan government to enact domestic violence legislation, and to make women's health, physical integrity, and equal rights in marriage a central focus of AIDS programming. For more than a decade, Ugandan women's rights advocates have urged Uganda to enact legislation addressing domestic relations and the rape and battery of women by their intimate partners. Yet for years, the bills have languished in parliament. Donor assistance to Uganda for HIV/AIDS continues to be considerable. Uganda is included among fourteen countries slated to receive five years of AIDS program support from the United States. The exact amount of U.S. aid that Uganda will ultimately receive remains unclear. In February, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria signed a grant worth over U.S.$36 million to support Uganda's ongoing fight against HIV/AIDS. Human Rights Watch urged the Global Fund, the U.S. government, the World Bank, and other donors to ensure that AIDS-prevention programs specifically target domestic violence, including sexual violence in marriage, as core components of their strategies. Cases of Ugandan Women Featured in the report: (Pseudonyms are used to protect privacy) Hadija Namaganda's HIV-positive husband raped and beat her viciously. During one brutal attack, he even bit off her ear. When he lay dying of AIDS and was too weak to beat her anymore, he ordered his younger brother to continue beating her. Namaganda, now HIV-positive, told Human Rights Watch: """"He used to force me to have sex with him after he became ill. If he wanted to, he would force me and accuse me of having other men. He said he would cut me up and throw me out. I didn't know about condoms. We didn't use them.""""

Recently the commission has been the target of aggressive attacks by its political opponents in advance of the public release of its findings. """"The truth commission will offer Peruvians for the first time a comprehensive and objective account of the terrible violence that gripped the country for nearly two decades,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"No doubt there are many who would prefer to suppress or muzzle its findings."""" A Lima prosecutor has opened an investigation to decide whether to charge the twelve members of the commission with """"advocating terrorism"""" (apología del terrorismo), a serious crime in Peru. A legislator sympathetic to former president Alberto Fujimori lodged the complaint because he objected to a video screened in June at a public hearing held by the commission. In the video, which was broadcast by several television channels, four former members of Shining Path, the Maoist insurgency responsible for thousands of civilian deaths in the 1980s, and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a smaller armed opposition group, expressed remorse for their actions. Human Rights Watch has criticized the offense of """"advocating terrorism"""" for being so vague and broad as to permit the imprisonment of people for exercising free speech. In January 2003, the Constitutional Court declared several provisions of Peru's anti-terrorism laws to be unconstitutional, including this one. However, the norm has yet to be formally repealed. Adding to the pressure on the commission, opposition legislators have called for the commission to be investigated, for its findings to be kept secret, and even for it to be disbanded. The Commission of Truth and Reconciliation was formed by former president Valentín Paniagua in June 2001. Its mandate is to provide an official record of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed in Peru between May 1980 and November 2000, and to recommend measures to strengthen human rights and democracy. It is scheduled to present a final report of its findings on August 28. The commission has held numerous public hearings, collected over 17,000 testimonies, and has developed a unified register of """"disappeared"""" persons. Far from exhibiting a bias toward armed opposition groups, it is expected to report that previous estimates of grave abuses committed by Shining Path were far too low. It will also document grave human rights violations, including disappearances, extrajudicial executions, and torture, committed by official security forces during three successive governments: those of presidents Fernando Belaúnde, Alan García, and Alberto Fujimori. In a July 23 letter to President Alejandro Toledo signed jointly with twelve other U.S.-based human rights groups, Human Rights Watch expressed """"deep admiration"""" for the work of the commission. It urged President Toledo to introduce legislation to create a follow-up group to ensure the timely implementation of the commission's recommendations.

The closed-door trial of rights defender and independent journalist Ruslan Sharipov began on July 23 in Tashkent. On August 8, new developments in the case gave rise to serious concern that Sharipov had been tortured. He waived his right to counsel, declared his intention to plead guilty on all charges, and asked that the only outside observer to the proceedings—his mother—be dismissed from the courtroom. Sharipov further offered to publicly beg for the forgiveness of President Karimov, the Minister of the Interior, and local police, and retracted all Internet news articles critical of the government that he had written from 2001 to 2003. A member of Sharipov’s newly-dismissed defense team who met with his client after the hearing told Human Rights Watch that Sharipov said he had been forced to reject counsel and profess his guilt, out of fear for his own safety and that of his lawyers and mother. “We urge the government of Uzbekistan to stop the politically motivated trial of Ruslan Sharipov; drop the charges under Article 120; and release him pending an impartial, independent review of the remaining charges against him,” Human Rights Watch said in a letter to Uzbekistan’s President Islam Karimov. “Human Rights Watch condemns his arrest as an effort to suppress free speech in Uzbekistan and as flagrant discrimination and persecution based on sexual orientation.” Twenty-five-year-old Sharipov was arrested by Tashkent police on May 26 on charges of homosexual conduct. Police accused him under Article 120 of the Uzbek Criminal Code, which punishes “besakalbazlyk” – defined as “consensual satisfaction of the sexual needs of one man with another man” – with up to three years in prison. Article 120 derives from a provision banning male homosexual conduct that was introduced into the Soviet Union’s laws under Joseph Stalin. Most successor states to the Soviet Union have repealed this provision. Only Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan are known to retain it. “Ruslan Sharipov has been a forthright critic of Uzbek government policies for years, and has faced steady threats and harassment as a result,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “He is now being tried behind closed doors, on what appear to be politically motivated and discriminatory charges. He should be freed, and Article 120 of the Criminal Code should be repealed.” After taking him into custody in May, police added additional charges to the accusations against Sharipov, including the charge of involving minors in “antisocial behavior” (Criminal Code Article 127) and having sexual relations with minors (Article 128). Until his statement on August 8, Sharipov had denied these charges and declared that they were fabricated in an attempt to silence him and put a stop to his human rights activities. “These additional charges appear to be an attempt to play on prejudices about gay men and to discourage the international community from speaking out in defense of Sharipov,” said Andersen. “But this is not the time to be silent.” Human Rights Watch fears that Sharipov’s declaration of guilt and the decision of such a well-known rights defender to waive his own rights and distance himself from his own work are indications that he has been tortured and that these statements were coerced. “Rather than proving Sharipov’s guilt, this latest development suggests the authorities’ manipulation and coercion of a vulnerable detainee,” said Andersen. During the first days of his detention, arresting officers threatened Sharipov with physical violence, including rape with a bottle. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that Sharipov faces continued threat of physical and psychological abuse while in custody.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","LGBT Rights"

A seasoned veteran of Mexico's human rights movement, Acosta earned a reputation as a dedicated and formidable advocate.

However, this guarantee of Taylor’s physical safety must not shield Taylor from prosecution before the Sierra Leone Special Court, said Human Rights Watch. “Taylor is an indicted war criminal accused of the most heinous of abuses,” said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Amnesty for Taylor would flout international law and would be an affront to his innumerable victims.” Taylor was elected president of Liberia in 1997 after a seven-year civil war. He soon gained international notoriety for his forces’ brutal abuses of civilians and for his use of child soldiers organized in “Small Boy Units.” In addition, Taylor’s support for the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone contributed to the deaths, rapes and mutilations of thousands of civilians there, prompting United Nations sanctions on his regime. Taylor’s forces have also been implicated in conflicts in neighboring Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire. On June 4, the Special Court for Sierra Leone “unsealed” its indictment against Taylor. He is charged as one of those “bearing the greatest responsibility” for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law committed during Sierra Leone’s civil war. The alleged crimes include murder, taking hostages, rape, extermination, sexual slavery, and the use of child soldiers. “The U.N. Security Council has called on all states to cooperate with the Sierra Leone Special Court,” said Mungoven. “Nigeria must not reject the Security Council’s request by harboring an indicted war criminal.” International law does not accept amnesty for atrocities that amount to crimes against humanity or war crimes. The Special Court’s statute and implementing legislation provide that neither amnesty nor a suspect’s official capacity is a bar to prosecution. The Special Court was established by agreement between the United Nations and Sierra Leone and is designed to function for three years. The Special Court has the power to prosecute those “who bear the greatest responsibility” for serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain violations of Sierra Leone law committed in Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.","Africa, Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone","International Justice"

Dr. Mugraby was arrested on August 8 on apparently politically motivated charges of """"impersonating a lawyer."""" Two policemen came to the 64-year-old lawyer's office in Beirut on August 7, and instructed him to report to the public prosecutor. When he arrived at the prosecutor's office on the morning of August 8, he was questioned for approximately four hours on charges of """"impersonating a lawyer,"""" according to information that Human Rights Watch has received. Under the law governing the legal profession in Lebanon, impersonating the identity of a lawyer is a criminal offense that carries a term of six months to three years in prison, lawyers told Human Rights Watch. Dr. Mugraby was then permitted to give his belt, mobile phone, wedding ring and other possessions to his wife Dalal before being taken into custody. As of this writing, he is believed to be held in a prison inside either the Ministry of Justice or the Palace of Justice, two buildings that are adjacent to one another. """"Lebanese authorities have harassed Dr. Mugraby for years, but his arrest today is simply outrageous,"""" said Virginia Sherry, associate director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"He has steadfastly refused to remain silent about Syria's repressive role in Lebanon and about corruption within the judiciary. This courageous man must be released immediately."""" The Beirut Bar Association has repeatedly attempted to prevent Dr. Mugraby from practicing as a lawyer in Lebanon. On April 4, 2002, one of the bar's disciplinary committees ruled that he should be barred from practicing law. Dr. Mugraby appealed this decision, but no action was taken on the appeal and it was never heard. On January 17, 2003, after a second disciplinary committee took a decision to disbar him, Dr. Mugraby once again lodged an appeal on March 14, 2003, which also was never heard. Decisions of the bar's disciplinary committees are not final until the appeals process is completed, Kamal el-Batal, an official with the Campaign for Integrity in the Judiciary, a Lebanese nongovernmental organization, told Human Rights Watch. Following the decisions of the two disciplinary committees, Dr. Mugraby continued to practice as a lawyer, since his appeals were never heard. According to information that Human Rights Watch has received, he paid his annual bar association dues, which were accepted, and he continued to register his power of attorney at the bar, which was also accepted. Human Rights Watch honored Dr. Muhamed Mugraby as a human rights defender in 1997. Dr. Mugraby holds degrees from the Lebanese University School of Law and Columbia University Law School in New York. He was an International Law Fellow at Columbia from 1963-1965 and then earned two masters degrees and a doctorate. He is a member of the International Bar Association and the International Association of Lawyers.","Middle East/North Africa, Lebanon",""

Afghanistan is still too unsafe for many refugees, and many have signed up to return without an accurate picture of conditions in their homeland. """"Western governments today claim that because the Taliban was defeated it is safe for many Afghans to return,"""" said Alison Parker, a refugee expert at Human Rights Watch. """"But the reality is quite different. Many refugees who have returned from Pakistan and Iran are being attacked, robbed and sexually assaulted. Persecution is persecution, whether at the hands of the Taliban or at the hands of local warlords now in control."""" Many Western governments are considering forced repatriation of Afghans to their war-torn country, and several nations are openly engaging in pressure tactics to speed returns. The United Kingdom forcibly returned 21 Afghans to their war-torn country in April after denying them refugee status, and Denmark returned two this month. In Belgium, some 100 Afghans occupied a church and launched a hunger strike on July 25 after the Belgian government rejected their requests for asylum. However, the Belgian authorities did recently decide to review the humanitarian and security conditions before commencing returns to Afghanistan, scheduled to begin in March 2004. In Australia, the government is offering Afghan refugees cash incentives of US $5,640 to return home; the British government is offering US $3,818 per family. Governments are required by international law to protect refugees from return to places where their lives or freedom will be threatened. Recent reports by Human Rights Watch and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees show that many returning refugees face serious human rights abuses, and that violence continues throughout the country. Police and soldiers have arrested and beaten Afghans for criticizing the government and trying to form political parties. Women and girls have been staying home from work and school to escape harassment, attacks and abductions. Human Rights Watch urged Western governments to take the current instability in Afghanistan into account when denying requests for asylum or visa renewals, and to offer all potential returnees a full and accurate description of what awaits them in their region. """"Too often, governments are making these decisions based on generalizations about Afghanistan, without taking into account the individual refugee's region, gender, ethnic background or political affiliation,"""" Parker said. """"Even the so-called voluntary returns can't be truly that unless Afghans have access to accurate information about conditions in their home areas. Human Rights Watch also called on the International Organization for Migration and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to disseminate this information.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

She said,   A little girl was injured-they shot her with a gun. Armed men wanted to steal everything in the home-all the carpets and everything-and when my relatives tried to keep them from coming inside, they fired shots and hit the little girl. They stole all the things inside the home. It happened in the afternoon, not at night. There were a lot of men-they all had guns.    A woman who was a refugee in Iran and who recently returned to Kabul told Human Rights Watch what happened to her relatives in West Kabul:   Men went into the house and made the men go into one room and the women go inside another. They spent all night with the women-young girls and old girls. They had a chicken, and the men cooked and ate it. When they went out, they locked the women and the men inside until 2:00 p.m. When the neighbors wondered why it was so quiet, and they saw that the door was open, and they called their names and asked what was wrong. They called and asked for help and all the neighbors came and helped.   I cannot sleep well because of the security problems, because I am worried about what will happen.    A single mother with a child who had been a refugee in Pakistan but recently returned to Kabul was robbed and stabbed by a group of six assailants who entered her home at about 8:00 p.m. in September 2002:   They searched but couldn't find much money because I had spent all of my savings to repair the house, and I didn't have much jewelry. Just some rings and some necklaces. They took all of that and that of my mother. Then they took me downstairs and three or four times took me to different places in the house. They said that if I didn't tell them where I put my money they would rape me. It was the worst thing that I could see or think about. I said, """"I won't let you. You can kill me but if you try to rape me I will shout and the neighbors will hear."""" I don't how I avoided being raped-maybe God was helping me.   As they were asking me over and over where the money was, they took a bayonet-a two-sided knife-and stabbed me, first in each leg, then in the left shoulder. They would say, """"Where is the money?"""" and then stab me. These wounds weren't too deep-they were just to scare me. At the end when I still wouldn't tell them anything, they stabbed me very deeply in the left shoulder below my collarbone. It took eight stitches to close the wound. It nearly severed the main nerve of my arm, and the doctor told me that if had been just a little deeper I would have lost the use of my arm. I spent one night and one day in the hospital. . . . Still during the night I am scared. Whenever I hear a noise, I see the faces of those men. I thank God that they didn't rape me, that they didn't do that. Every time I see the scar on my shoulder I remember what happened.    A refugee family who recently returned from Iran to Kabul also had their house robbed by men who said they were government soldiers and tied the family up while they searched the house. One of the women in the family told Human Rights Watch what happened:   We don't have much gold, just jewelry, but they took it. The soldiers asked for it. We said, """"If you take it, we will have nothing."""" They took it and asked for money. We said, """"We have no money, you can see. We can't even make windows."""" My brother untied his hands to go fight [them]. A man put a Kalashnikov [AK-47 assault rifle] to my brother's head and said, """"I will kill you if you don't shut up."""" My brother said, """"If I had known you were thieves, I would have done something."""" They said, """"We are more clever than you."""" For the second time, they tied his hands and feet and said, """"Don't make any noise. We are from the government and you can't do anything. We are thirsty for Hazara blood. I can kill you and put you in the well. We are the enemy of the Hazaras.""""    Extortion During Return   Human Rights Watch also documented attacks on refugees en route to their places of origin. A refugee woman returning from Iran interviewed on March 16, 2003 in Paghman, Afghanistan told a Human Rights Watch researcher   On the way from Iran, soldiers with Kalashnikovs stole our money. I hid my daughter from the soldiers under my legs behind a blanket because she is a young girl. The soldiers put a gun to my father's back and said, """"where is the money?"""" and I was afraid that they had killed him. I had the purse with gold and thought that they would release him if I gave it to them so I said please take it and let us go. At night we were in a hotel. It was dark and they came in. They had long hair and big turbans, Afghan dress. They were Taliban.    Political Intimidation   A former refugee who fled to Pakistan when the Taliban were in power told Human Rights Watch how he has been harassed after returning to Afghanistan because of his political activity. Currently working for a newspaper called Mashal Democracy, this former refugee told a Human Rights Watch researcher   We were the only ones to support the students who were arrested last year during the university demonstrations and we had problems because of this. The paper's owner was imprisoned for eleven days. He got out of jail with UN support. We write whatever the problem is. We don't censor anything. We are free to say all our problems. Once we wrote about Sayyaf and the commanders and why they are creating problems for the people and they sent some people who said """"Why are you doing this?"""" Every time we publish something they send someone. This happens to every newspaper.    Restrictions on Women and Girls   A woman refugee who returned from Pakistan in early 2002, explained why she chose to go to Kabul and not back to her home province of Paghman,   There are no school buildings - there are [railroad] containers for schools. There are schools for girls - in the areas that [the] Mullah controls there are schools for girls to class six. But they can only study up to class six - then they can do nothing.    A refugee woman who had recently returned from Pakistan explained that the reason women cannot go to work in her home province is """"because of Sayyaf [local warlord] and the soldiers and there is no center for women to go and work.""""   Another recently returned refugee woman told a Human Rights Watch researcher that """"men with guns"""" create problems for girls. She said, """"[They] don't allow girls to get an education or go to school. They have burned schools, a girls' school in Chandarbooee. It was called Omarahan school. It happened about three months ago.""""   A fifteen-year-old refugee girl who recently returned to Paghman from Pakistan with her family said:   I wore a chadori [burqa] for the first time today because I am inside Afghanistan. There are no schools for girls here. I studied until fifth class in Iran, but there are no schools here. I would like to study. Here there is no water, electricity. I cannot go out freely, there is no good road, no shops, no hospital, no classes. In Iran, I played tennis, volleyball, soccer, swimming.    Destruction of Homes and Insecurity in Home Provinces   A man who had returned from Iran a year ago, who decided to stay in Kabul rather than go to his family's land in Paghman, gave his reasons for not returning to Paghman:   If the armed men or soldiers come to know that there is money in your pocket or in your home, you will be robbed. Since there is no security there, and no peace, you cannot live there. Let's count the reasons you cannot live there: First, there is no security. Second, there is no chance for education, especially for girls. Third, the lack of health services: there are no birthing clinics for women to have children. Fourth, there is the culture that is imposed on people by the armed men and the clergy. For instance, the boys cannot go out bareheaded, they have got to wear a hat.    Human Rights Watch interviewed a refugee woman who recently returned to Kabul from Iran about why her family was living in a house in Kabul with four other families. She explained that her family could not go back to their home province because, """"we don't have any house to stay in there. We want to go but we don't have any buildings left.""""   Another woman who had been a refugee in Pakistan for seven months after the U.S.-led bombing campaign in 2001 came originally from Paghman but was now living in Kabul. She explained why she could not go home to Paghman: """"besides of the security problems, we would have to rebuild our house, [and] there is no hospital or clinic.""""","Asia, Afghanistan",""

At least 22 people with links to Tamil political parties opposed to the LTTE have been killed in politically motivated attacks since the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE signed a ceasefire in February 2002. Many others have been abducted, their fate still unknown. In several instances, witnesses have identified the perpetrators as members of the LTTE.

Security Council considers changes in the office of the prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), human rights groups urged the Council to safeguard the independence of the ICTR and its capacity to render justice fully and impartially. In an effort to improve the efficiency of the two tribunals, the U.N. Secretary-General has asked the Security Council to divide the post of prosecutor of the ICTR and of the International Criminal Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia (ICTY), and to name a new prosecutor for the ICTR.     The ICTR has been plagued by management problems throughout the institution, including inconsistent leadership and the lack of an effective prosecution strategy in the office of the prosecutor. But in attempting to improve the efficiency of the Prosecutor's office, the Security Council must ensure that changes do not undermine the independence and impartiality of the ICTR, including in prosecuting charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against members of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA).     The government of Rwanda has vigorously resisted any such prosecutions, making it impossible for the ICTR prosecutor to bring charges against members of the RPA, the armed branch of the Rwandan Patriotic Front in 1994.    Background     The ICTR has thus far prosecuted only persons charged with committing genocide in Rwanda in 1994. Against the backdrop of the genocide, the Rwandan Patriotic Army soldiers also killed thousands of civilians, violating international humanitarian law. By contrast, the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia has prosecuted persons from all sides of that conflict.     The U.N. Commission of Experts established by the Security Council in July 1994 concluded that some members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and of its army (the RPA) had """"perpetrated serious breaches of international humanitarian law"""" and """"crimes against humanity."""" When the Security Council established the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on the recommendation of the Commission, it mandated that the ICTR prosecute not just the genocide that had devastated Rwanda but also """"other systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law"""" (Security Council Resolution 955, 1994), including those committed by members of the RPA.     In addition to the Commission of Experts, the Field Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR), and United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as well as Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH), and Amnesty International have all documented these violations of international law.     During her term as Prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte announced investigations against RPA soldiers several times but was forced to suspend them after strong opposition from the current government of Rwanda, in which RPF members play the predominant role. After one such announcement, the Rwandan government imposed restrictions on the travel of witnesses to genocide trials, which are held in Arusha, Tanzania, as a way of bringing pressure on the ICTR. As a result the ICTR had to suspend three trials of persons accused of genocide.     Prosecutor Del Ponte appealed to the Security Council in July 2002 to oblige Rwanda to cooperate with the ICTR, as it must do under chapter VII of the UN Charter. In response the Security Council issued a presidential statement in December 2002 reaffirming its support for the ICTR as """"impartial and independent"""" and reminding Rwanda of its obligations to cooperate with it.     Rwandan authorities, including President Paul Kagame, have admitted that some RPA soldiers killed civilians in violation of international law. As the prospect of ICTR prosecutions became more real, the Rwandan government argued that it had prosecuted or would prosecute these soldiers. In the nine years of the current government, trials of soldiers accused of these crimes have been few and the penalties of those convicted have been light. Only one senior officer, a major, has been tried for massacres committed in 1994. Convicted by court martial in January in 1998 after confessing to having ordered the slaughter of more than thirty civilians, he was sentenced to life in prison, but he successfully appealed his sentence and was freed soon after. By June 1998 five others had been convicted of capital offenses committed in 1994, but four were privates and only one was a corporal and all received light sentences. The corporal, convicted of having killed fifteen civilians, was punished by only two years in prison.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice, United Nations"

In particular, the Security Council must ensure that any changes do not undermine the ICTR's efforts to prosecute charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity against members of the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA). The Security Council should clearly and publicly reaffirm its support for the prosecutor in the execution of his or her duties, including prosecutions of those charged with genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, regardless of their political, ethnic, or national affiliation. It should make clear that this policy includes members of the RPA. The Security Council should assure the Office of the Prosecutor of the time needed to investigate these crimes of the RPA, even if this requires investigations to continue beyond the current deadline of 2004 and it should notify the government of Rwanda that its full cooperation is required under Chapter VII for all work of the ICTR, whether it involves genocide or other crimes.

According to local human rights groups and Tamil political parties, at least thirty-eight people have been killed or were abducted and remain missing in politically motivated attacks against opponents of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) since Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and LTTE leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran signed a ceasefire agreement in February 2002. Hundreds of others have been threatened, assaulted, and injured. Most of the victims were members or former members of Tamil political groups opposed to the LTTE,1 including some senior officials. Among those killed were Tamils who had worked for the Sri Lankan security forces. All of these cases appear either to be politically motivated or indicate the possibility of political motivations. In some instances witnesses have identified the perpetrators as members of the LTTE. In others, evidence of LTTE involvement is more circumstantial. Many local observers believe that the killings are indicative of a systematic campaign to silence the LTTE’s opposition. The Eelam People’s Democratic Party (EPDP) and Eelam People’s Revolutionary Liberation Front (Varathar) EPRLF(V), at present the LTTE’s two main political opponents, have together lost thirty-two members or supporters killed or missing since February 2002.2 This includes persons who had ceased active political involvement with the parties. The People’s Liberation Organization of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE) has had at least fifteen members or former members killed or injured in the same time period. On May 13 a single grenade attack on a volleyball game in front of the PLOTE office in Batticaloa killed five and injured six. TELO (Varathan), a breakaway unit of the Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization that worked with the elite police Special Task Force in eastern Sri Lanka, has reportedly had at least four members killed or missing. The ceasefire between the government and the LTTE, which has been in place since February 2002, has offered an important respite from two decades of conflict-related violence and security restrictions that have taken a heavy toll on civilians. It has also given the LTTE free access to towns like Batticaloa, Jaffna, and Trincomalee, previously under army control, for the purpose of opening political offices. Although the pact prohibits LTTE cadres from carrying arms in these areas, the prohibition is not well enforced. According to critics, the LTTE’s new political offices have become useful points from which to coordinate surveillance, recruitment, and extortion and, when necessary, the assault, abduction, and assassination of rivals. Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission Articles 1 and 2 of the February 2002 ceasefire agreement called for a halt to all military action, including assassinations and abductions, and prohibited hostile acts against the civilian population.3 Under article 3 of the ceasefire agreement, the mandate to oversee the parties’ compliance with the terms of the ceasefire was given to the Norwegian-led Sri Lankan Monitoring Mission (SLMM).4 The SLMM is tasked with inquiring into complaints made by the parties and the people of Sri Lanka, and assisting parties in the settlement of disputes.5 It has no executive power. The SLMM consists of monitors from the Nordic countries, including Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland. 6 By April 2003 it had forty-seven members, and in July announced plans to increase its team of naval monitors following a series of sea clashes. Its headquarters is in Colombo. The SLMM has liaison officers to the Sri Lankan government in Colombo and to the LTTE leadership in Kilinochchi and has six district offices in Jaffna, Mannar, Vavuniya, Trincomalee, Batticaloa, and Ampara. Two naval monitoring teams are based in Jaffna and Trincomalee. From the outset, there has been no agreement for a monitoring presence at the key LTTE bases in Killinochchi or Mullaitivu. Local monitoring committees work alongside the SLMM District Offices. Each local committee has five members: two persons appointed by the Sri Lankan government, two appointed by the LTTE, and an international SLMM monitor acting as chairman.7 During the sixth session of peace talks at Hakone, Japan from March 18-21, 2003, the government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE agreed to strengthen the mandate and capacity of the SLMM to undertake preventive measures to avoid serious incidents at sea and on land. As a precondition for the SLMM to take on a stronger role, the parties pledged to ensure full compliance with the rulings of the SLMM, guarantee the security of its personnel in all situations, and take disciplinary action against anyone endangering the lives of SLMM personnel.8 From the start the SLMM has interpreted its mandate narrowly.9 Although it has increasingly addressed complaints of abuse against civilians (especially abduction of children for recruitment and extortion cases), it has not reported publicly on apparent political killings by the LTTE. No substantial investigation of most of these cases has even been attempted. A spokesperson for the SLMM claimed that investigating these murders was beyond the monitors’ mandate. Reuters quoted Agnes Bragadottir on July 6, 2003, as saying: “The Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission should not be drawn into internal politics. This is not a monitoring issue for us, this is a criminal case. The police have to monitor law and order.”10 The only way to know if a case is political in nature is to investigate. And, as the spokeswoman herself conceded, at least some of the killings are political, not simply criminal, apparently perpetrated by a party to the conflict against persons protected by the terms of the agreement. The SLMM appears to lack both sufficient political distance from the negotiating process and a genuine capacity to investigate these incidents. As a Norwegian-led initiative, the monitoring effort is too closely tied to the politics of the peace process. The SLMM has (with rare, but notable exceptions) been cautious about criticizing the parties. And without a capability for police-style criminal investigations, there is currently no way for the SLMM to conduct adequate inquiries. The police remain primarily responsible for investigations, but they have often failed to undertake them. With the current ceasefire in place and the military confined to barracks, police are once again the main security force active in the north and east. But they are relative strangers to the areas they police and are vulnerable to attack should hostilities resume. The result is that they either forge relationships with the more powerful and locally influential LTTE, or try to stay out of the way. Police officers are well aware that when the LTTE broke a fifteen-month cease-fire in 1990, LTTE forces overran police stations throughout the north and east, abducting and killing hundreds of police officers. The current violent campaign against opponents of the LTTE constitutes both a violation of the ceasefire and systematic human rights abuse. It is important for both the Norwegian government and the SLMM to publicly acknowledge and condemn this, and for serious investigations to be conducted into all such incidents, both to bring perpetrators to justice and as part of a strategy to stop future violence. These attacks are eroding public confidence in the peace process and increasing the likelihood that violent retaliation will perpetuate Sri Lanka’s two-decade cycle of violence. Killings and other Attacks since the Ceasefire Attacks on current or former members of Tamil political groups who are perceived as opponents of the LTTE have occurred regularly since the beginning of the ceasefire. The attacks escalated dramatically in May and June 2003 following the withdrawal of the LTTE from the peace negotiations. Political parties at risk and human rights defenders began to publish lists of the attacks, hoping that the evidence would compel the international community, particularly the SLMM, to speak out. The following is a selection of cases reported by Tamil political parties, human rights groups, and newspapers in Sri Lanka. This list, although incomplete, indicates a grave pattern of abuse that requires immediate investigation. 1. In Batticaloa on December 3, 2002, the LTTE reportedly abducted three senior EPDP members: EPDP organizer Sellathurai Thangarajah (known as Viji), 32, Nagarajah Nesarajah (Nivas), 48, former provincial council member for the North-East, and Kandasamy Gnanajothi (Navam), 46. According to local sources, a passenger van driver who was linked to the LTTE befriended the three men and invited them to an evening party at Kallady beach. The men became intoxicated at the party and the van driver led them to a waiting LTTE van. The van is reported to have taken them to the LTTE-controlled area through Chenkalady. The men have not been heard from since, and van driver has vanished. A complaint from family members and the EPDP was lodged with the police and the SLMM. 2. On the evening of December 16, 2002, P. Alahathurai, 35, of Mandur, a member of the EPRLF(V) and chairman of the Porativu local council, left his party office for his sister’s home. At around 7:30 p.m., witnesses saw him being led away by two known LTTE affiliates. Two days later near a lagoon at Kannapattai, Alahathurai’s body was discovered tied up and showing signs of torture. His hand and ear had been severed. The two men seen abducting Alahathurai were Ramiah Rajendran (Rajan) and Mylvaganam Paramanathan. Ramiah Rajendran had been a watchman for the local council, who had spent a year in detention for possession of a bomb. He was known to be attached to the local Porativu intelligence office of the LTTE. Paramanathan is known to be attached to the LTTE’s political office in Mandur. The post-mortem on the victim’s body was delayed by several days because the attendant physicians were afraid to handle the case. After the post-mortem was carried out and, on the basis of the evidence before him, the Batticaloa magistrate ordered the arrest of Rajan and Paramanathan, but the police took no action. On January 5, 2003, Kausalyan, the LTTE political head for Batticaloa and Amparai issued a statement claiming that Alahathurai was an LTTE supporter and that they were searching for the perpetrators of his murder. A few days later, Kausalyan and another LTTE leader, requested the Sri Lankan authorities to investigate the murder and other disappearances. The North-East provincial administration, which is dominated by the LTTE, directed the Porativu local council, which Alahathirai had chaired and which was dominated by EPRLF(V), to reinstate Rajan as their watchman and pay his salary in arrears. To date the police have failed to act to arrest Rajan or Paramanathan for the murder. 3. In an incident a month earlier, P. Alahathirai’s younger brother, Poopalapillai Vijayarajah, in Mandur was approached by LTTE members saying that an LTTE political officer wanted him to come to their office in Palugamam to discuss a local dispute. Vijayarajah refused to go saying that if he needed help he would go to the police. This remark, as well his brother’s affiliation with the EPRLF(V), was reportedly passed on to the LTTE leader. On November 12, 2002, the LTTE officer arrived at Vijayarajah’s home in a pickup truck, beat him and tried to take him to Palugamam by road. The police Special Task Force refused to let them pass. He was then taken to Palugamam across the lagoon by boat. There he was beaten again, and suffered serious injuries. The LTTE officer chastised him for failing to obey the LTTE and said that except for the ceasefire, he would have been shot. Vijayarajah was then returned to Mandur and warned not to tell anyone about his abduction. On November 13, Vijayarajah was admitted to Kaluwanchikudy Hospital; a complaint was also lodged with the SLMM in Batticaloa. The SLMM went immediately to the relevant LTTE officials and warned them against committing violence against civilians. LTTE members nonetheless went to Kaluwanchikudy Hospital and demanded that the doctor discharge the patient to them. The doctor refused and transferred him to Batticaloa Hospital for safety. The SLMM then took video pictures of his injuries. When his brother Alahathurai was murdered a month later, Vijayarajah became convinced he could not ever return to Mandur. 4. On the morning of January 5, 2003, the body of a Muslim auto rickshaw driver, A.T.M. Hussain (Kalanthar), 68, was found in the Tamil neighborhood of Kalmadu in Oddaimavady. He had last been seen at about 1:30 a.m. at an auto rickshaw stand. He was found with a cut on his neck caused by a sharp object and his hands were tied behind his back. At the inquest, the Judicial Medical Officer said he had died from blood loss, shock, and cardiac arrest. Local auto drivers implicated a Tamil auto driver, with whom Hussain had reportedly had a disagreement. The driver was known to be close to Reggie, the LTTE area leader in Valaichenai, and had a record of complicity in criminal activity by the LTTE.11 Reggie’s brother, LTTE eastern commander Karuna, denied accusations about the LTTE’s role in the murder and pledged to help find the culprits. Reggie reportedly told the SLMM that someone else was responsible for the crime and had dumped the body in Kalmadu to put the blame on the LTTE and the Tamil community. At the time of the killing, the LTTE was reportedly threatening Tamils not to do business with Muslims. Three days earlier, on January 2, a grenade had been thrown into the Muslim Market, injuring five Muslims, including a policeman. 5. Late in the evening of March 18, 2003, unidentified perpetrators on a motorcycle shot and killed Kadirgamanathan Ragupathy, 35, on Galle Road in the Colombo suburb of Mt. Lavinia. Ragupathy, a resident of Karaitivu in Ampara district who had been living in Colombo for more than a year, was attacked as he was approaching the place where he had rented a room. Ragupathy had been a member of the PLOTE and had been working for the Sri Lankan Directorate of Military Intelligence. Ragupathy had earlier told Military Intelligence that he believed he was being followed. The day Ragupathy was killed, people considered under threat from the LTTE in Colombo received a warning that Mylvaganam Sivakumar, head of LTTE intelligence in Batticaloa, had left Batticaloa for Colombo. Sivakumar is known to have returned to Batticaloa the day after Ragupathy’s murder. According to the Island newspaper on May 24, Sivakumar was named as the prime suspect in the case. 6. In Araiampathy on the morning of April 2, 2003, Seenithamby Ranjan (Varathan), a local council member and leader of a breakaway faction of TELO, was seen talking to a senior police officer from the Kattankudy police station in front of the Araiampathy Hospital. According to several people standing outside the hospital, Mylvaganam Sivakumar, LTTE intelligence head for Batticaloa town, passed them on a motorcycle heading in the direction of Kalmunai. Sivakumar turned around, rode back towards them, pulled out a pistol and fired at Varathan. Varathan, who was not armed, tried to flee. Sivakumar got off his motorcycle, pursued Varathan on foot, then shot and killed him. Sivakumar, who observers say continues to move freely in the area, has not been questioned in relation to this murder. The Batticaloa magistrate reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Sivakumar. 7. On the evening of June 1, 2003, unknown gunmen shot and killed Kalirajah Ramanan, 35, in the area of Punochchimunai, north of Batticaloa town. Ramanan was reportedly seen being followed by two youths who shot him at pointblank range with handguns and disappeared. Ramanan died instantly. The police are reportedly investigating the murder. Ramanan had belonged to several Tamil political organizations, most recently the EPRLF(V). He was elected to the Batticaloa Municipal council as a TELO candidate. After the dissolution of the council, he left TELO and joined the EPDP. He later joined the EPRLF(V). Ramanan had recently returned from the Middle East where he had been working, and was living in Navatkuda with his wife and children. 8. In downtown Trincomalee on June 2, 2003, at about 8:00 p.m., unidentified gunmen shot dead EPRLF(V) member S. Kirubairaja at the Madathady junction. Kirubairaja was reportedly returning home from the EPRLF(V) party office on Sea View Road, close to Inner Harbour Road junction. The police are reportedly investigating the murder. 9. Sinniah Samuel (Vinnoth), 31, aformer member of TELO and later of the EPDP, and his fifteen-month-old baby daughter Abhisha were killed by an exploding grenade in Araiyampathi, Batticaloa district at 9:40 p.m. on June 6. Another child, eight-year-old Sivagnanam Laveena, was injured in the explosion. Samuel, who had left politics and was working as a mason in Araiyampathi, was riding a bicycle with his daughter on Amarasingam Road in Araiyampathi after attending a festival at the Kannakai Amman Temple when he was killed. The police are reportedly investigating. 10. Raju Wijenathan (Wijeyan), 33, a member of the EPDP was shot and killed in the early morning of June 7, 2003, in Trincomalee, by unidentified gunmen. Wijenathan was staying in his brother's restaurant when he was killed. 11. On June 12, 2003, unknown assailants on the Sabapathipillai Road, Chunnakam, Jaffna, attacked former EPRLF(V) member Nagamuthu Nagendran with sharp weapons, severing both his hands. 12. On June 14, 2003, at 6:15 a.m., a sniper shot and killed Thambirajah Subathiran (Robert), Deputy Leader of the EPRLF(V), age 46, as he exercised in his third floor office at EPRLF(V) headquarters in Jaffna. Subathiran is the most senior Tamil political figure to be killed since the beginning of the current ceasefire. The gunman reportedly fired from the neighboring Vembadi Girls College. Witnesses place Easwaran, the LTTE area leader for Nallur, at the school the day before Subathiran was killed. According to local sources, the police have not questioned Easwaran. 13. On June 15, 2003, Ponniah Ramachandran, 42, a senior member of EPDP in Batticaloa, was returning home after work when two young men on bicycles shot him dead on the Kalladi-Thiruchenthoor road. Seven bullets were recovered from his body. A grenade was also thrown at him. 14. On June 23, 2003, at about 6:45 p.m. in Veeramunai, Amparai district, unknown assailants traveling in an auto rickshaw shot and killed Kumarasamy Kumarathasan, 36, a former member of the EPRLF(V) and a father of two, as he road home from work on a motorcycle. 15. On July 4, 2003, at about 6:15 p.m., Vairamuththu Mehanathan (Justin), 32, a longtime member of PLOTE, was shot dead by two attackers on a motorcycle as he rode his bicycle home from the PLOTE office on Vaidiyamalai Road in Puthur, Batticaloa district. His assailants used a handgun and Mehanathan was reportedly shot at close range. Batticaloa police said they were investigating. On July 5, 2003, members of the funeral possession for Mehanathan carried the coffin to the office of the SLMM in Batticaloa. The mourners demanded that the SLMM bring the LTTE under control. A week later, unknown gunmen in Puthur on July 11, 2003, shot and killed LTTE member Velupillai Paraneetharan, 18, in broad daylight. A police investigation reportedly found that Paraneetharan had been shot four times. Local sources believe that PLOTE was responsible for the murder as retribution for the murder of Mehanathan. 16. On July 8, 2003, Selvin, a member of the EPRLF(V), was admitted to the Jaffna Teaching Hospital and underwent surgery for injuries sustained as a result of a sword attack on him in the Gurunagar neighborhood of Jaffna town. Selvin was an associate of the late Thambirajah Subathiran, the EPRLF(V) deputy leader who was killed on June 14 by a sniper in Jaffna. The police said they were investigating the case.   1 Several Tamil groups served as auxiliary forces for the Sri Lankan security forces, and most had at some point in their history functioned as armed guerilla groups before entering electoral politics. All carried arms, and many engaged in violence including both internecine clashes and abuse of civilians. The ceasefire agreement contains a broadly worded provision for the disarmament of “Tamil paramilitary groups.” This in practice meant all Tamil parties except the LTTE were required to relinquish weapons. Members say this decision left members of these groups vulnerable to attack. 2 The EPRLF is split into two wings. Former chief minister of the North East province, Annamalai Varathajaperumal leads one section, which is called “Varathar” wing. The other wing, “Suresh,” is led by Secretary General Suresh Premachchandran and is aligned with the LTTE. 3 Agreement On a Ceasefire Between the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Ceasefire Agreement),February 22, 2003 (accessed at http://www.peaceinsrilanka.org/insidepages/Agreement/agceasefire.asp#A3).

It emphasized that an anti-drug program that authorized the downing of aircraft simply because they fail to observe identification procedures or disregard orders to land would violate these standards. """"Suspect aircraft cannot simply be fired upon as if they were combatants in an armed conflict,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch.

Bush in July 2001, for example, Human Rights Watch explained how the use of lethal force in aerial anti-narcotics operations in Peru had violated international law.

These agreements, in the form requested by the United States so far, are not only contrary to article 98(2) of the ICC treaty but also to international law as they defeat the """"object and purpose"""" of the Rome Statute.     """"While politicians insist that relationships between the United States and the Baltics have not been strained by the prohibition of aid, the truth is that the three countries are being unfairly punished,"""" said Isaac Flattau of Human Rights Watch.     However, despite the setback Latvia has suffered to its military funding, Human Rights Watch applauds Latvia's legally sound decision to resist U.S. demands and thus meet its legal obligations under the ICC treaty. Latvia has demonstrated once more its strong support for the Court, especially since Anita Usacka, a former Constitutional Court judge in Latvia, is one of the first 18 judges elected to the court.     Latvia has joined the EU and 9 other EU accession states, as well as a growing group of countries that have reaffirmed their principled stance against impunity by refusing to sign a BIA with the United States. EU's strong position regarding BIAs was renewed last June 15 with the adoption of a new Common Position that called on EU member states to assist states in withstanding U.S. pressure to sign a BIA.     The United States' punitive measures often go above and beyond the mere implementation of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), a piece of anti-ICC legislation passed by Congress last year. A senior Latvian diplomat told Human Rights Watch that the Bush Administration has even decided to withhold $2.7 million in promised supplemental funding to support Latvian troops in Iraq. At the same time, the United States will still financially support Lithuania's participation in Iraq although additional military aid is still being withheld.     Moreover, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are on the brink of joining NATO, and consequently, all of their military aid will be restored in the spring of 2004. Intermittently starting and stopping the flow of aid demonstrates the erratic nature of the United States' campaign to undermine the ICC.     """"The Bush administration is irrationally threatening some of its key friends, including Latvia,"""" said Flattau. """"This is a highly short-sighted and counter-productive approach to U.S. foreign policy.""""     Indeed, targeted states of the anti-ICC campaign include crucial allies in the global campaign against terrorism and the war on drugs, two essential elements of U.S. foreign policy. Military aid has also been suspended for six out of seven NATO accession states, while it is common knowledge that the expansion of NATO has long been a priority for the U.S. State Department. Much to the surprise of the Bush administration, these states pledge to continue to support the ICC, rather than bend under U.S. pressure.     """"Latvia and the other 34 states that suffered suspension of military aid should not be punished,"""" said Flattau, """"for respecting the rule of law, a principle which the United States claims to hold dear.""""","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Latvia, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Damiri after his conviction on charges of crimes against humanity by a Jakarta human rights court demonstrates again that the process has been a sham, Human Rights Watch said today. Damiri was sentenced to three years in prison, but remains free pending appeal. Damiri was charged with responsibility for a series of attacks on civilians committed by his subordinates in April and September 1999. The court was established to prosecute those responsible for the 1999 violence in East Timor. """"Damiri is the poster child for impunity in Indonesia,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"Even the prosecution asked for an acquittal. It's clear that the government is not interested in holding senior military officials accountable for their actions, no matter how heinous."""" Damiri oversaw all Indonesian military operations in East Timor at the time that serious human rights crimes, including murder, arson, and forced expulsion, were carried out by the Indonesian military and military-supported militias in 1999. Damiri has been indicted separately by the U.N.-created Serious Crimes Unit in the East Timor capital, Dili, but Indonesia has refused to turn any of its citizens over for trial. As if to demonstrate the lack of seriousness of the trial process, on June 5, 2003, prosecutor S. Hozie rested the Attorney General's case against Damiri by asking the court to acquit him of all charges, stating that, """"The defendant had not been proven guilty of crimes against humanity."""" Other convicted officers also remain free pending appeal. Few people in Indonesia believe Damiri will ever serve any time in prison. Instead of arresting or at least suspending Damiri from the armed forces, in December 1999 he was promoted to the position of operational assistant to the armed forces chief of staff in Jakarta. Damiri is now a senior officer responsible for prosecuting the war in Aceh province. """"Damiri must be removed from his position in Aceh immediately,"""" said Adams. """"A convicted human rights abuser must not be involved in conducting a war. His role in Aceh is not only an embarrassment to Indonesia but causes grave concern that the tactics used in East Timor may also be used in Aceh."""" Damiri, the highest-ranking military defendant in Jakarta's ad hoc court on East Timor, missed at least four of his scheduled court appearances due to his involvement in directing military operations in Aceh province, now under martial law since May 19, 2003. Human Rights Watch has long maintained that Indonesia's efforts to bring high-ranking perpetrators to justice have been a failure. (See """"Justice Denied for East Timor: Indonesia's Sham Prosecutions, the Need to Strengthen the Trial Process in East Timor, and the Imperative of U.N. Action,"""" on Related Material on this page.) Human Rights Watch renewed its call for the U.N. Secretary-General to commission a report by a group of experts to examine all options for justice for East Timor, including examining the Jakarta trial process, looking at mechanisms for extradition and trials of key suspects, considering ways to strengthen East Timor's Serious Crimes Unit's capacity to continue its investigations and prosecutions, and the possible creation of an ad hoc international tribunal. Leading donors, such as the United States, Australia, European Union and Japan, were urged to support such an inquiry. """"Indonesia had the chance to prove that it could prosecute and discipline its soldiers for violations of international law,"""" said Adams. """"We now know conclusively that it either cannot or will not. Now it's time for justice to be offered to the East Timorese by the international community. Indonesia's friends need to make it clear to the Indonesian government and military that good relations are at stake, particularly with the military."""" Damiri's verdict in Jakarta effectively brings the Indonesian ad hoc court on East Timor to a close. Of the eighteen defendants tried in Jakarta, twelve have been acquitted. The five other convicted defendants received nominal sentences and have not served any time in prison, pending the result of the appeals process. Former East Timor Governor Abilio Soares, the first defendant convicted, recently had his three-year sentence upheld by the appeals panel. He remains free pending the decision of Indonesia's Supreme Court. In September 1999 the Indonesian National Army and Timorese militias went on a campaign of murder, arson, and forced expulsion after the people of East Timor voted for independence in a United Nations administered referendum. After almost twenty-five years of brutal occupation, an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 East Timorese civilians lost their lives in the months before, and days immediately after, the voting. Approximately 500,000 people were forced from their homes or fled to seek refuge. Damiri was charged with responsibility for the actions of his subordinates in relation to the attack on the Liquisa Church and Pastor Rafael Dos Santos' residence on April 6th, 1999, the attack on Isaac Leandro's house and Manuel Carrascalao's house in Dili on April 17th, 1999, the attack on Dili Diocese on September 5th, 1999, the attack on Bishop Belo's residence on September 6th, 1999, and the Suai Ave Maria Church massacre on September 6th, 1999. On February 22, 2003, East Timor's Serious Crimes Unit filed an indictment against Damiri charging him with five counts of crimes against humanity for murder, persecution, and deportation or forcible transfer of the civilian population. The charges stemmed from the criminal acts and omissions perpetrated by the Indonesian military and militia groups throughout East Timor in 1999. Damiri was charged with both individual criminal responsibility and command responsibility for the actions or omissions of his subordinates. Indonesia has refused to extradite the general to East Timor to stand trial.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice"

The 55-page report, """"Trapped Between Two Wars: Violence Against Civilians in Western Côte d'Ivoire,"""" documents widespread abuses against civilians in fighting following a September 2002 army mutiny. The abuses include summary executions, sexual violence against women and girls, and looting of civilian property by Ivorian government troops, government-supported civilian militias, and by the rebel groups. Both sides have recruited Liberian fighters, some of them from refugee camps in Côte d'Ivoire. """"Civilian militias are a perilous legacy of the war, and they are still active in parts of the west,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division. """"Disarming and making them accountable should be a top priority for the government of reconciliation."""" Côte d'Ivoire's eight-month conflict was characterized by limited direct fighting between the nominal warring parties, but serious and sometimes systematic abuses against civilians. The new report documents these abuses in the west of the country, where tensions over land and proximity to Liberia exacerbated the conflict. Ivorian government forces and rebel groups were often responsible for reprisal killings of civilians perceived to support the opposing side, and government-backed civilian militias and Liberian mercenaries fighting on both sides committed several massacres of civilians based mainly on their ethnic affiliation. In one of the incidents described in the report, Liberian fighters backed by the Ivorian government killed more than sixty civilians in Bangolo in early March of this year. Virtually all of the victims were from northern ethnic groups perceived to be supporting the Ivorian rebels. Some were shot at close range with their hands tied together. Less than two weeks later, rebel forces attacked the nearby village of Dah, killing more than 40 civilians, witnesses reported. Some victims died when their homes were burned down around them. Government-backed civilian militias were also responsible for scores of attacks on West African immigrants to Côte d'Ivoire, most of them targeting the Burkinabé agricultural workers who work the western coffee and cocoa plantations. The Human Rights Watch report documents a pattern of collaboration between the Ivorian security forces and local civilian militias in which Burkinabé civilians were sometimes stopped and shot in broad daylight in the middle of western towns such as Duékoué. The report calls for an international commission of inquiry to investigate abuses and recommend measures to bring perpetrators to justice, and for an extensive field-based human rights monitoring presence. It also calls on the Ivorian government to immediately stop backing the militias. Human Rights Watch asserts that the abuses are rooted in ethnic discrimination and a climate of impunity dating from the presidential and parliamentary elections of 2000, in which several hundred people were killed or injured by state security forces and civilian collaborators. """"Unless there is a real commitment to ensure accountability for abuses by all sides-going back to the elections in October 2000 as well as during the recent conflict-it is difficult to see how this very polarized society can be reunited."""" Takirambudde said. Background The conflict in Côte d'Ivoire began on September 19, 2002, when a group of former army officers launched an attempted coup d'état in Abidjan following several years of political instability. The war escalated late last year when two new Ivorian rebel groups attacked towns in the west of the country along the Liberian border, using Liberian recruits. The Ivorian government then armed its own force of Liberian fighters and began supporting militia groups known as self-defence committees in the rural areas. By April 2003, western Côte d'Ivoire was overrun by Liberian fighters and civilian militias. Many displaced civilians escaping the zone faced no option but to flee into Liberia, which was gripped by its own civil war. The human rights abuses by the Liberian fighters and militias fuelled a conflict between two of the main ethnic groups in the west. Dozens of villages were attacked and hundreds of civilians reportedly killed or injured by fighters from both sides. A May 3, 2003, ceasefire supported by the deployment of French and West African troops has ended active hostilities, and a substantial number of Liberian fighters have left the area. However, some western towns such as Toulepleu remain under the control of Liberian fighters, and many civilians are reluctant to return to their homes as long as bands of armed men still prey on small villages and farms off the main roads. Parts of the west were cut off from humanitarian aid for almost six months, and an area once renowned for its agricultural productivity now struggles with a collapsed health care system and food shortages.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/08/02/belgium-universal-jurisdiction-law-repealed","Belgium- Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed","Belgium: Universal Jurisdiction Law Repealed","","08/02/2003","(Brussels) - The Belgian Parliament's repeal of its landmark """"universal jurisdiction"""" statute is a step backwards in the global fight against the worst atrocities, six human rights groups said today. Nonetheless, some cases already being investigated by Belgian courts will continue, including those concerning Rwanda, Guatemala and Chad's Hissène Habré. Belgium's 1993 universal jurisdiction law, which permitted victims to file complaints in Belgium for atrocities committed abroad, had made Belgium a leader in the struggle for international justice, the groups said. Now, the Belgian law resembles that of other European countries.     """"With its universal jurisdiction law, Belgium helped destroy the wall of impunity behind which the world's tyrants had always hidden to shield themselves from justice,"""" said the groups. """"It is regrettable that Belgium has now forgotten the victims to whom it gave a hope of justice.""""     The groups denounced the pressure from the United States which led Belgium to today's action. In June, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld threatened Belgium that it risked losing its status as host to NATO's headquarters if it did not rescind the law. The groups said that the U.S. attack was part of its worldwide campaign against international justice, including the International Criminal Court. The U.S. campaign, as well as the Belgian about-face, go against a growing global trend to hold accountable those accused of the worst crimes, which can be seen in the creation of war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and Yugoslavia, and the International Criminal Court. More than one hundred states have adopted some form of universal jurisdiction, permitting them to pursue the authors of international crimes.     After today, Belgian courts will only have jurisdiction over international crimes if the accused is Belgian or has his primary residence in Belgium; if the victim is Belgian or has lived in Belgium for at least three years at the time the crimes were committed; or if Belgium is required by treaty to exercise jurisdiction over the case. The new law also considerably reduces victims' ability to obtain direct access to the courts - unless the accused is Belgian or has his primary residence in Belgium, the decision whether or not to proceed with any complaint rests entirely with the state prosecutor. Belgium has thus restricted the reach of universal jurisdiction in its courts by adopting a law similar to or more restrictive than most European countries.     The law adopted today does, however, preserve a limited number of cases that have already begun to move forward, including those concerning the Rwandan genocide and the killing of two Belgian priests in Guatemala, as well as the complaints filed against ex-Chadian dictator Hissène Habré. In the Habré case, a Belgian investigating judge went to Chad in 2002 to investigate the crimes. Habré is currently under house arrest in Senegal, and in October 2002 the Chadian government waived any immunity which Habré might seek to assert, removing one of the last potential hurdles to his extradition and trial. The groups said that his trial would be important to send a message to tyrants around the world that their impunity is a thing of the past.    NGOs: Amnesty International Belgium, La Ligue des Droits de l'Homme, Liga voor Mensenrechten, la Fédération Internationale des Droits de l'Homme, Avocats sans Frontières and Human Rights Watch.","Africa, Chad, Rwanda, Americas, Guatemala, Europe/Central Asia, Belgium, United States","International Justice"

""""It has hijacked the good intentions of the international community to serve a narrow and ideologically driven crusade against international justice.""""     The operative draft of the resolution provided """"exclusive jurisdiction"""" over persons who commit a crime as part of the Liberia peacekeeping mission to the state that sent him or her. This provision undermines three critical facets of international law: the International Criminal Court Treaty; domestic laws allowing for universal jurisdiction over the most serious international crimes; and domestic laws allowing for jurisdiction where a state´s national is a victim of a crime (""""passive personality jurisdiction"""").     The domestic laws of a number of states, including some Security Council members, allow for passive personality jurisdiction. The U.S. delegation insisted on the paragraph to insulate its officials and personnel from being held accountable for the commission of serious crimes in Liberia.     The U.S. action unnecessarily forced Security Council members to choose between the immediate deployment of peacekeepers to Liberia and upholding established principles of law. France, Germany and Mexico abstained in the vote on the resolution in apparent protest over the impunity issue.     """"The people of Liberia should not have been held hostage to the perverse U.S. position on the rule of law,"""" said Richard Dicker.     The passage of the resolution seeks to create a dangerous precedent in the struggle against impunity for human rights crimes.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/08/01/rwanda-and-security-council-changing-international-tribunal","Rwanda and the Security Council- Changing the International Tribunal","Rwanda and the Security Council: Changing the International Tribunal","Letter to Council Members on the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda","08/01/2003","Your Excellency:   As the Security Council considers proposed changes in the post of prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), its deliberations provide an important opportunity to review the current status and future needs of the ICTR. Human Rights Watch would like to offer some observations and recommendations to help guide that assessment. We are making similar recommendations in separate letters to the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP), Chambers and Registry.     After years of unsatisfactory performance, the ICTR has improved its functioning in recent months. The appointment of the deputy prosecutor and chief of prosecutions brought much needed stability to the OTP and encouraged staff to focus on moving ahead more efficiently with prosecutions. The arrival of new judges and the election of ad litem judges promises to speed up trials, and the establishment of a coordination council and a management committee under the newly elected president promise better use of resources and coordination among the three organs.   Fundamental problems, however, remain to be addressed. These problems concern management of the ICTR on the one hand and its ability to fulfill its mandate completely and impartially by prosecuting war crimes and crimes against humanity charged against members of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and its army, the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), on the other hand.   Important management problems exist in all three organs of the ICTR. Several of these require integrated solutions involving OTP, Chambers and Registry. Several require action from the Security Council, which should play an important role in supporting improvements at the ICTR. However, an ICTR, no matter how well run, that ends its operation by prosecuting only cases of genocide and ignoring RPA war crimes and crimes against humanity will lack credibility, even for its prosecutions of the genocide.   The Security Council must determine whether the proposal to split the post of prosecutor of the two tribunals will improve their efficiency. At the same time it must ensure that any change does not hinder the delivery of impartial justice and the complete fulfillment of the Tribunal's mandate.  Problem 1: Improving the speed and quality of trials  Problem 2: Implementing an effective completion strategy  Problem 3: Fulfilling the mandate of the ICTR completely and impartially Problem 4: Increasing attention to crimes of sexual violence  Problem 5: Improving relations of the ICTR with the Rwandan people  Problem 6: Compensating persons wrongfully detained by the ICTR and ICTY  Problem 1: Improving the speed and quality of trials    The OTP has suffered from inconsistent leadership, in part because two key posts were long vacant, in part because the current prosecutor spends a substantial part of her time in the Hague (although less than did her predecessors). The appointment of the deputy prosecutor and the chief of prosecutions has brought much needed stability to the OTP, allowing for the development of longer-term planning.   At times OTP prosecutors have not been ready to present cases efficiently and effectively in court, necessitating trial adjournments or wasting the time of the court. In some instances these failures reflect poor investigations, conducted discontinuously, by different teams, over a period of years. Poor coordination between investigators and the trial team also contributes to unsatisfactory courtroom performance.   Important posts in the prosecutor's office have sometimes been left vacant for excessively long periods of time. In some cases OTP officials and registry officials evaluate candidates differently, leading to unproductive and protracted conflict over hiring decisions. Efforts by the OTP to transfer staff from Kigali to Arusha have encountered undue bureaucratic delays.   The OTP has begun trials of the four most important military officers accused of genocide and will soon begin trials of other military and civilian authorities of major importance. Instead of concentrating resources on these major trials, the OTP is simultaneously preparing trials of other persons accused of lesser roles and it is investigating the cases of suspects yet to be arrested.   The OTP tried to speed prosecutions by grouping defendants for trials but this practice has not measurably improved the pace and may in fact have slowed it. Obtaining plea agreements would lighten the load on the OTP, but it has not obtained many such agreements   The pace of trials is also the responsibility of the judges, some of whom lack experience in managing a courtroom. Judges sometimes permit lengthy and irrelevant examination of witnesses. Judges have generally sat only half a day on Friday. They have taken month-long vacations simultaneously, leaving courtrooms empty during both summer and winter recesses.   Judges have permitted parties to submit extensive amounts of written documentation and have allowed parties to develop the practice of submitting written briefs at the conclusion of a case, some of which run to hundreds of pages.   The inability of registry staff to keep up with the demand for translations of these thousands of pages of documents slows the work of all parties and of the judges. In some cases, the lack of translations of needed documents has resulted in postponement of trials.   The addition of ad litem judges promises to speed the pace of trials, but as the Statute now stands, those judges cannot be used to maximum effectiveness. They cannot themselves form three-judges benches; they must sit in combination with permanent judges. In addition, ad litem judges may not review indictments or adjudicate pretrial proceedings.   Recommended Action from the OTP  Concentrate resources on the major trials instead of attempting to advance simultaneously on cases of persons accused of lesser roles in the genocide.  Require better job performance from staff and coordinate work more effectively within trial teams, between trial teams, and between trial teams and investigators.  Continue efforts to recruit the highest quality staff.  Redouble efforts to encourage plea arrangements.  Reconsider the use of group trials and sever cases if this will speed trials.   Recommended Action from the Chambers  Hold full day sessions five days a week and arrange judicial vacations so that courtrooms are always in use.  Adopt a uniform practice concerning the admissibility of evidence so as to limit the time needed in court to decide such questions.  Exercise tighter control over the relevance of examination of witnesses and over the time taken by all parties in presenting their cases.  Decide as many issues as possible on oral motion.  Encourage the submission of evidence in sworn written testimony for background matters rather than orally in the courtroom.   Recommended Action from the Registry  Facilitate the recruitment and hiring of staff, including for the OTP, with competence and relevant job experience being the most important criteria.  Improve the efficiency of clerical services, including particularly that of staff responsible for translations.   Recommended Action from the Security Council  Amend the ICTR Statute to permit ad litem judges to constitute three-judge benches without the obligatory participation of permanent judges.  Amend the ICTR Statute to permit ad litem judges to adjudicate pretrial proceedings and to review indictments.   Problem 2: Implementing an effective completion strategy    From the start, the ICTR took custody of suspects accused of roles of varying importance, some delivered by national jurisdictions, some arrested by ICTR officials without regard for the number of cases that could be prosecuted. The OTP originally proposed an unrealistic program of new arrests. It has since revised these plans and now undertakes to bring twenty-four new indictments. Adding even that number to the existing load will make it difficult if not impossible to complete trials by 2008.   To meet the 2008 deadline, the OTP proposes to transfer some forty cases to national jurisdictions pursuant to Rule 11 bis adopted in July 2002. There is a risk that prosecutions in some national jurisdictions, including that of Rwanda, may not be conducted according to internationally accepted human rights and due process standards. The Rwandan judicial system itself has been overwhelmed and unable to bring to trial more than a small part of the persons detained. The number of cases to be transferred can be reduced by speeding up the current pace of ICTR trials so that more suspects can be tried before the tribunal ends its operations; by encouraging plea arrangements where appropriate; and by withdrawing indictments that are too weak for prosecution.   If any cases are to be transferred, there are several issues to address. One is the legality of Rule 11 bis, which may be ultra vires. Another is the lack of safeguards for confidential witnesses or testimony should the prosecutor transmit information to national jurisdictions as is now permitted by Rule 11 bis.   The president of the ICTR is negotiating a memorandum of understanding with the Government of Rwanda to provide for transfers of some cases to its jurisdiction and to resolve some of the practical difficulties involved.   Recommended Action from the OTP  The OTP should concentrate its efforts on the arrest and prosecution of those suspects who allegedly played roles of greatest importance in leading the genocide or cases that can substantially advance the prosecution of such persons.  The OTP should encourage plea agreements where appropriate.  The OTP should promptly withdraw any indictments where ample evidence for conviction is lacking or will not be obtained before the trial begins.  The OTP should minimize the number of cases referred to national jurisdictions and urge jurisdictions of nations other than Rwanda to prosecute such cases.   Recommended Action from Chambers  The president of the ICTR should complete the memorandum of understanding with the Rwandan government and with any other national jurisdictions to which cases might be transferred, ensuring that sentencing would comport with the prohibition of capital and corporal punishment. The ICTR should retain ultimate jurisdiction over such cases and should be prepared to reassert jurisdiction if monitoring shows that trials are not being conducted in good faith and in accord with internationally accepted human rights and due process norms.  Judges should amend rule 11 bis to protect the identity of and information from confidential witnesses. The OTP should be permitted to share such information with national jurisdictions only if the witness has given his or her consent.   Recommended Action from the Security Council  The Security Council should amend Article 8 of the Statute of the ICTR to authorize referral of ICTR cases to national jurisdictions. Having clear authorization from the Security Council for the transfer would make legal appeals and related delays less likely.   Problem 3: Fulfilling the mandate of the ICTR completely and impartially   The genocide in Rwanda was perpetrated during a war between the Rwandan government and the RPF. In defeating the Rwandan government, some RPA soldiers killed thousands of civilians in violation of international humanitarian law.   Rwandan government officials, including President Paul Kagame, acknowledge that some RPA soldiers committed violations of international humanitarian law in 1994. These same officials, including President Kagame, originally agreed to assist the ICTR in prosecuting these crimes, but after the prosecutor stated publicly that she was investigating several such cases, the Rwandan government began obstructing the work of her office. To pressure the prosecutor to halt these investigations, the Rwandan government imposed new restrictions on the travel of witnesses needed by the prosecutor for testimony against persons accused of genocide. As a result, the ICTR was forced to suspend three genocide trials in 2002.   In July 2002 the prosecutor notified the Security Council of the noncooperation of the Rwandan government. The Council took until December to act and then delivered only a mild reminder to the Rwandan government that it must cooperate with the ICTR.   Each time that the prosecutor announced that investigations of the RPA were under way, she was forced to suspend work on these cases, in part because of the lack of strong Security Council backing, in part because of the persistent and effective Rwandan opposition. Investigation of crimes by RPA soldiers have been stalled for the last year.   As public attention focused on the lack of justice for RPA crimes in 1994, the Rwandan government claimed that it had prosecuted or would prosecute soldiers accused of such crimes. In nine years in power, the Rwandan government has brought only a few dozen suspects to trial on charges of 1994 crimes that violate international humanitarian law. Those convicted have served only brief terms in jail.   Rwandan government officials have tried to make arrangements with the prosecutor's office to end or at least to minimize prosecutions of RPA soldiers in return for providing greater cooperation in prosecuting cases of genocide. The last such attempt took place in Washington, D.C. in mid-May 2003, facilitated by U.S. government officials. The effort failed and the Rwandan government stepped up its campaign to remove the current prosecutor.   Recommended Action from the OTP  Pursue investigations and prosecutions of members of the RPF and RPA for whom there is evidence of serious war crimes or crimes against humanity.   Recommended Action from the Security Council  Support the prosecutor promptly, publicly, and firmly in efforts to execute the ICTR mandate completely. In a resolution or presidential statement, inform the Rwandan government that its cooperation with the ICTR, for cases involving genocide as well as for those involving other violations of international humanitarian law, is obligatory under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Be prepared to take the necessary steps to ensure that the Rwandan Government lives up to is obligations.  Grant the prosecutor an extension of the 2004 deadline on investigations if necessary to gather evidence of RPA and RPF crimes.   Problem 4: Increasing attention to crimes of sexual violence    The OTP often fails to include charges of sexual violence in cases where such violence is part of the crime under investigation. The number of new indictments for crimes of sexual violence has declined in the last four years and adequate evidence has not been developed for cases in which such charges are made.   Recommended Action from the OTP  Provide adequate resources to the newly re-established team for investigating charges of sexual violence and ensure that its findings are fully and appropriately used by trial teams.  Ensure that necessary staff are adequately trained to gather proof of these crimes and to deal appropriately with victims and witnesses on these issues.  Focus new investigations on documenting charges of sexual violence in cases of major importance.   Problem 5: Improving relations of the ICTR with the Rwandan people    The ICTR is supposed to exist in part to satisfy the need of the Rwandan people for justice, but few Rwandans outside of the urban elite and a limited number of survivors of the genocide know about it. The computerized information center in the national capital serves only a tiny minority of this largely rural society where many are illiterate.   Some of the Rwandans acquainted with the court are witnesses, some of whom were badly treated or believe that they were badly treated by the ICTR. In some cases, staff failed to treat them with respect, and in one unfortunate incident, judges laughed during the testimony of a rape victim. Although there is no evidence that witnesses have suffered physical harm as a result of their testimony, some have been harassed and intimidated. ICTR personnel have not systematically monitored the situations of former witnesses.   Rwandans in general do not follow ICTR proceedings and even witnesses sometimes do not know the outcome of cases in which they testified.   The ICTR provides medical assistance to witnesses during their stay in Arusha but assumes no responsibility after that time. The Registrar has begun efforts to create a trust fund to aid genocide survivors who are ill or otherwise in need.   Recommended Action from the OTP  Ensure that investigators and trial teams deal with witnesses respectfully and with minimum disruption of their lives. If a witness is to be called in more than one trial, make one person responsible for handling all contacts with the witness.   Recommended Action from the Registry  Designate staff to ensure continued contact with witnesses after they have testified so that any harassment or threats are promptly dealt with.  Increase efforts to make the ICTR known among ordinary Rwandans, particularly those who live outside the urban centers. Should the Rwandan government permit the establishment of private radio stations, arrange for the broadcast of portions of the trials in Kinyarwanda.  Continue efforts to organize a trust fund for the benefit of needy genocide survivors.   Recommended Action from Chambers  Ensure a courtroom environment that enables genocide survivors, and particularly victims of sexual violence, to testify with due regard to their humanity and dignity.   Problem 6: Compensating persons wrongfully detained by the ICTR and ICTY   In September 2000, the presidents of the ICTR and the ICTY formally requested the Security Council to amend the Statutes of their courts to allow them to award compensation to persons who had been wrongfully detained, prosecuted, or convicted by the Tribunals in accordance with Article 9(5) of the ICCPR.[1] Compensation is particularly appropriate given the lengthy pretrial detention at the ICTR.   Recommended Action from the Security Council  Act promptly on this request to enable the courts to provide compensation in appropriate cases.   We look forward to continued dialogue with you on these important matters.

Human Rights Watch is also asking the government to investigate accusations by the Monitor's editor, Nhial Bol, that a vehicle crashed into his car on July 13 in the Kobar section of Khartoum in a government-sponsored attempt to kill him. The Sudanese Court of Crimes Against the State revoked the publishing license of the Khartoum Monitor on July 13 of this year because of an interview it published in 2001 on slavery in southern Sudan. The action closed the newspaper indefinitely. The court also convicted the Monitor's editor, Nhial Bol, and the article's author, William Ezekiel, of crimes against the state, and fined the newspaper 400,000 Sudanese dinars (U.S.$1,554). """"By closing the Monitor, the government is escalating its campaign against media criticism of its policies,"""" said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"This shutdown has a chilling effect on the entire news business in Sudan, reminding editors and owners that they publish at their peril."""" The latest shutdown occurred just two days after the Monitor had resumed production after a 2-month closure. A Khartoum criminal court had ordered the newspaper shut down for two months for failure to pay criminal fines imposed on May 9. The fines penalized the paper's publisher for running an article that the court found """"incited hatred"""" by allegedly misquoting the Qu'ran. The Monitor and its employees have been harassed by security officials many times in the past year. In March, security forces confiscated an entire press run of the Monitor to prevent the publication of an article on Islam the government deemed offensive. The government also arrested and detained the article's author, Edward Tersu Lado, for ten days. In early September 2002, security officials confiscated issues of the Monitor and interrogated its editors about articles it printed on the Machakos peace process between the government and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army. In November, the government-controlled National Press Council suspended the newspaper for two days for an article on AIDS deemed too sexual. Human Rights Watch awarded the Monitor in 2002 with a Hellman-Hammett grant, given to writers who are targets of political persecution. The government of Sudan has not limited press censorship to the Monitor since seizing power in a military-Islamist coup in 1989. It often confiscates editions that go beyond Khartoum's unspoken """"red line"""" and report on """"forbidden"""" topics such as slavery, peace negotiations, opposition politicians, and the continuing armed conflict in western Sudan. In February 2003, the government-controlled National Press Council instructed newspapers not to report on the Machakos process. This peace process, which may result in a new constitution and an end to the twenty-year civil war in which two million have died, has been in progress since June 2002 in Kenya The Arabic-language Al Ra'i Al A'am daily newspaper came out in favor of the Machakos peace process on July 3, 2003. On July 4, security officers confiscated 7,000 copies of newspaper carrying that editorial. Security officials also confiscated copies of another Arabic-language daily, Alalwan, for printing the """"Khartoum Declaration"""" of one hundred organizations, political parties, and individuals in favor of Machakos. In early May, the Sudanese government also confiscated entire press runs of the Arabic-language Al Sahafa and Al Shari' Al Syasi newspapers in retaliation for articles both newspapers printed on the Darfur conflict. Sudanese officials arrested Yousef al-Bashir Mousa, a journalist with Al Sahafa in the city of Nyala, on May 4 and held him for 10 days for reporting that Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir was considering firing three state governors in the western region of Darfur.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/31/right-way-trade-0","The Right Way to Trade","The Right Way to Trade","","07/31/2003","The Bush administration is quietly carrying on a major new trade negotiation with Central America that could show -- contrary to the notion that globalization hurts workers -- how international trade deals can increase respect for labor rights. But the Bush team must get the right formula into its briefing books. This week the United States and Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have been conducting the sixth of nine negotiating rounds for a U.S.-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). The United States has already proposed labor rights provisions for CAFTA similar to those in the U.S free trade agreements with Chile and Singapore. But those are the wrong models. The Chile and Singapore agreements require only that countries enforce their existing labor laws, even if those laws are too weak to protect workers' human rights and punish abusers. In Central America that simply won't work. Take El Salvador. In February, while conducting investigations for Human Rights Watch, I found rampant abuse of workers' human rights, largely due to weak laws and a government with little interest in enforcing --much less improving -- them. Union leaders and members are illegally fired with no right to reinstatement. Employers share lists of """"troublemakers,"""" making it difficult, if not impossible, for workers who stand up for their rights to find jobs. And children as young as 10 cut sugar cane under hazardous conditions, while labor ministry officials regard them as """"parents' helpers"""" and look the other way. Even current and former labor ministry officials, speaking anonymously for fear of reprisals, acknowledged to me the ministry's systematic failure to follow mandatory inspection procedures, reluctance to report harmful child labor in agriculture, indifference to and complicity in anti-union conduct, and obstruction of union registration. To account for these and other serious labor rights abuses in the region, the United States should negotiate provisions in CAFTA that address two fundamental questions: What would motivate Central American countries with weak labor laws and even weaker enforcement mechanisms to start upholding international standards? And what would motivate them to continue to do so? The answer to the first question should be based on the U.S.-Cambodia textile agreement, touted by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick as """"an excellent example of the way trade agreements lead to economic growth and promote a greater respect for workers' rights."""" The agreement allows the United States to raise limits on its Cambodian textile imports if working conditions in that sector """"substantially comply"""" with local labor laws and international standards. A similar approach to U.S. market access under CAFTA should be adopted. The United States ought to grant tariff reductions only if it determines, in annual reviews, that the Central American countries' labor laws have been amended to comply with international standards and that they are effectively enforced. The reviews should be conducted, and the reductions granted, sector by sector. And the International Labor Organization should have a key monitoring role, as it does with the U.S.-Cambodia agreement. This approach creates an incentive -- a carrot, not a stick -- to encourage respect for workers' human rights, granting tariff reductions commensurate with the speed at which countries improve labor conditions. It turns the """"race to the bottom"""" on its head, as five Central American countries strive for high labor standards to gain greater access to U.S. markets. It avoids the broad-brush approach of sanctioning a country for the ills of one sector, because problem sectors are denied tariff reductions while better-performing sectors enjoy them. But what prevents Central American countries from reverting to their old laws -- or even weakening them -- when tariffs are fully eliminated? Nothing, under the CAFTA labor rights provisions that the United States proposed in May. To prevent such backsliding, CAFTA should also require that domestic labor laws continue to meet international standards and not later be lowered to attract trade or investment. Violations of these requirements should carry the same penalties as CAFTA's commercial provisions, including possible fines and sanctions. What if CAFTA fails to include these provisions? Central American countries will have no incentive to improve their deficient labor laws. They will enjoy ever-greater tariff benefits, while labor rights abuses persist. And the Bush administration will have lost an opportunity to demonstrate how free trade can benefit workers.","Americas, United States, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

The legislation, which passed Congress unanimously on Friday, seeks to protect federal, state, and local prisoners from rape and sexual assault. In 2001, Human Rights Watch published a comprehensive report, No Escape documenting the prevalence and devastating impact of male rape in U.S. prisons and the failure of prison officials to act decisively to prevent it. The report, which was widely covered in the media, drew national attention to a widespread abuse that had previously been either ignored or treated as fodder for bad jokes. """"For far too long the United States has ignored the brutality of prison rape,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. """"Sexual violence - indeed, any violence - should not be part of anyone's prison sentence. This legislation puts prison staff on notice that they can no longer turn a blind eye to rape."""" The Prison Rape Elimination Act would initiate a series of efforts to track and curtail the incidence of rape in prisons and jails. The legislation requires the collection of national statistics on the prevalence and effects of rape; directs the Department of Justice to provide training and technical assistance to federal, state and local officials responsible for addressing prison rape; authorizes federal grants to support state and local programs to prevent and punish prison rape; and provides for the reduction of federal prison funding for states that do not control prison rape. The National Prison Rape Reduction Commission, a federal body created by the legislation, will spearhead the creation of a comprehensive report on the subject and issue recommendations to be used by the Attorney General in generating national standards to detect, prevent, and punish prison rape. """"The unanimous passage of this bill is an extraordinary accomplishment,"""" said Fellner. """"If implemented fully and effectively, it will be a first step towards ensuring that prison sentences are not sentences to sexual violence and abuse."""" The Prison Rape Elimination Act reflects the efforts of a broad and diverse legislative coalition. Congressional sponsors of the legislation held hearings on prison rape and drew extensively on No Escape in arguing for the need for a federal response. Victims of prison rape may suffer enormous psychological and physical injury. The negative impact of sexual abuse in prisons is compounded by the increased risk of transmission for HIV, hepatitis, and other sexually transmitted diseases. In the past, correctional authorities have done little to prevent rape from happening, to protect the victims, and to punish those responsible. If implemented effectively, the Prison Rape Elimination Act will catalyze nationwide efforts to eliminate prison rape by inmates and correctional staff. It signals renewed Congressional concern about the conditions under which more than two million individuals are confined.","United States",""

The law authorizes federal grants for programs to prevent and punish prison rape, and would cut federal prison funding for states that do not control the sexual assault of prisoners.

These commitments are in line with international norms and standards prohibiting the use of child soldiers, including the optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, which sets eighteen as the minimum age for participation in hostilities, and prohibits all recruitment of children under the age of eighteen by armed forces distinct from the armed forces of a state.   The commitments made by LURD are particularly encouraging given the increased exploitation of children as soldiers in West Africa in recent months. Human Rights Watch has monitored the situation in Liberia with great concern, and has noted the widespread recruitment and use of children as soldiers by parties to the conflict, including LURD, MODEL and government forces. Demobilization of children from LURD's forces and their successful rehabilitation and reintegration is not only in the best interests of the children involved, but will also help establish a positive example for other parties to conflict in the region.   As you are no doubt aware, in November of 2002, the UN Secretary-General included a list of specific parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers in violation of international law to his report to the Security Council on children and armed conflict. This list included both LURD and the Liberian government. In response, the Security Council requested reports on steps being made by the parties to end recruitment and use of child soldiers, and asked the Secretary-General to submit a report on any progress made by October 31 of this year. If sufficient progress is not shown, the Security Council has pledged to consider additional steps in relation to these parties.   We encourage LURD to fully implement its new commitments as soon as possible, and to ensure that in accordance with international standards, your forces refrain not only from using children in combat roles, but also from using boys and girls in non-combatant roles such as porters, cooks, intelligence gatherers. We also would like to request information on the concrete steps that are being taken by LURD to ensure the leadership's new instructions are being conveyed to all levels of the organization and carried out. Human Rights Watch would like to bring to your attention that we have received reports dated just prior to your announcement that LURD troops continued to use children younger than eighteen among its fighting units near Monrovia, and that children in their early teens continued to be deployed behind the frontlines as weapons porters and caretakers. We would therefore be interested to learn more about the timeframe for this process, how many children have already been brought to national headquarters in Voinjama City for demobilization, details regarding the rehabilitation programs that are being set up, and the steps being taken to ensure that children are not recruited in the future, including the sanctions that will be applied to any commander or recruiter found to be recruiting children.   We would also welcome the opportunity to meet with LURD representatives to discuss these issues.

""""Farah's conviction violates international law protecting freedom of expression,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Human Rights Watch executive director for Africa. """"It is disappointing that a country that so recently promised to uphold international standards has violated them so blatantly."""" Djibouti became a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which protects freedom of expression, in February 2003. Farah has been jailed since April for publishing an article that criticized the Djibouti army's chief of staff. He is being held in solitary confinement in an 8-by-5-foot cell with scant water rations in temperatures that top 40 degrees Centigrade (104 degrees Fahrenheit). He was acquitted of the defamation charge at trial, but the verdict was reversed on appeal. In addition to his prison term, the appellate court ordered Farah to pay civil damages of 13 million Djibouti francs (about U.S. $74,000) and a criminal fine of 1 million Djibouti francs (about U.S. $5,500). These are huge sums in a country where the average per capita income is less than U.S. $800. Farah is president of the Movement for Democratic Renewal and Development, an opposition political party. He is also editor and publisher of le Renouveau, a weekly newspaper that is one of the few media outlets in Djibouti not owned or controlled by the government or its allies. Because the government and its allies occupy all seats in the national assembly, Djibouti's few independent newspapers are the only available fora for expressing political dissent. Human Rights Watch sent a letter today to Djibouti's president, Ismaël Omar Guelleh, urging Farah's immediate and unconditional release as well as repeal of the Horn of Africa nation's anti-defamation law. It states that Farah's criminal conviction, the conditions of confinement, and the closure of the newspaper """"not only violate international law, but can only serve to undermine the democratic ideals enshrined in the Djibouti Constitution and to threaten the legitimacy of state institutions.""""","Africa, Djibouti",""

The reportwarns that violence, political intimidation, and attacks on women and girls are discouraging political participation and endangering gains made on women's rights in Afghanistan over the last year. """"Human rights abuses in Afghanistan are being committed by gunmen and warlords who were propelled into power by the United States and its coalition partners after the Taliban fell in 2001,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These men and others have essentially hijacked the country outside of Kabul. With less than a year to go before national elections, Afghanistan's human rights situation appears to be worsening."""" The 101-page report, """"Killing You Is a Very Easy Thing for Us"""": Human Rights Abuses in Southeast Afghanistan, documents army and police troops kidnapping Afghans and holding them for ransom in unofficial prisons; breaking into households and robbing families; raping women, girls and boys; and extorting shopkeepers and bus, truck and taxi drivers. The report also describes political organizers, journalists and media editors being threatened with death, arrested and harassed by army, police and intelligence agents. The subject area of the report, the southeast of Afghanistan and Kabul city, is one of the most densely populated areas of Afghanistan. Because soldiers are targeting women and girls, many are staying indoors, especially in rural areas, making it impossible for them to attend school, go to work, or actively participate in the country's reconstruction. In many places, human rights abuses are driving many Afghan families to keep their girls out of school. The atmosphere of violence, along with resurgent religious fundamentalism in parts of the country, is endangering the most important human rights improvement since the end of the Taliban--the ability of girls to go back to school. """"The fact is that most girls in Afghanistan are still not in school,"""" said Adams. """"In many cases, returning refugee families who sent their girls to school in Pakistan or Iran are afraid to do the same in Afghanistan."""" The testimony of victims and witnesses implicates soldiers and police under the command of many high-level military and political officials in Afghanistan. These include Mohammad Qasim Fahim, the Minister of Defense; Hazrat Ali, the military leader of the Eastern Region; Younis Qanooni, the Minister of Education; Burhanuddin Rabbani, the former president of Afghanistan; and Abdul Rabb al-Rasul Sayyaf, a powerful former mujahidin leader to whom many of the officials involved in the documented abuses in Kabul city and province remain loyal. The report urges the Afghan government to sideline and pressure abusive leaders and to seek more international assistance in its efforts. Human Rights Watch called on the United States, the United Kingdom, Iran, Russia and other external powers to end their support for local strongmen and commanders involved in human rights abuses. """"External support for warlords is destabilizing Afghanistan,"""" said Adams. """"The United States and the United Kingdom, in particular, need to decide whether they are with President Karzai and other reformers in Kabul or with the warlords. The longer they wait, the more difficult it will be to loosen the warlords' grip on power."""" Human Rights Watch emphasized the need for the Afghan government and the international community to redouble efforts to reform the Afghan Ministry of Defense. The Ministry of Defense in Kabul is currently dominated by the political and military faction """"Shura-e Nazar,"""" a loose alliance of former mujahidin parties. Making the ministry more ethnically and politically representative is a vital prerequisite for the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programs that could lessen the power of abusive military rulers and their troops. Human Rights Watch urged NATO to expand the geographic scope of the U.N. authorized security force, the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), currently stationed only in Kabul, when it takes over ISAF command in August. Human Rights Watch also urged NATO to widen ISAF's mandate to include disarmament and human rights protection. Plans to deploy more international Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) may be a positive step if they focus on security, but they are not a substitute for an expanded security force. Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to increase its human rights monitoring and protection efforts through the deployment of significant numbers of U.N. human rights officers around the country. """"With more U.N. human rights workers on the ground, victims will be better able to seek redress and protection. An increase in monitoring will have the added benefit of giving the Afghan administration and the international community better information about what is happening around the country,"""" said Adams. """"This is standard operating procedure in other U.N. missions, but so far the United Nations has refused to take this step."""" Human Rights Watch also urged the United Nations to increase its public reporting on the human rights situation and to supply more personnel to work side-by-side with the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Attacks on Education"

If passed, the bill would bar Palestinians married to Israelis from living with their spouses in Israel, affecting thousands of couples. The proposed “Nationality and Entry into Israel (temporary order)” law prohibits Palestinians from residing with their Israeli spouses in Israel. The law will prevent all newly-married couples from being able to live together where they choose. It will also affect couples who have been married for years, and whose requests for residence permits are still pending. “This bill blatantly discriminates against Israelis of Palestinian origin and their Palestinian spouses,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “It’s scandalous that the Government has presented this bill – and it’s shocking that the Knesset is rushing it through. ” Article (2) of the bill says the minister of the interior “shall not grant” Palestinian residents of the Occupied Territories a permit to reside or stay in Israel, nor grant them citizenship. To date, almost the only Palestinians who have obtained residence permits are those who have married Israeli citizens. The bill does not affect marriages between Israeli citizens and other foreign spouses. According to Knesset testimony given by Israeli officials on July 18, 16,000 applications for the unification of couples in joint Israeli-Palestinian marriages were approved in the last decade. The vast majority of Israeli citizens who marry Palestinians are themselves of Palestinian origin. The bill will severely impact the family life of Israeli citizens of Palestinian origin, some twenty percent of the Israeli population. “Israel has chosen to ratify numerous international treaties that forbid discrimination and oblige it to protect family life,” said Megally. “The bill clearly violates these obligations.” Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International wrote a joint letter to Israeli parliamentarian urging them to reject the draft legislation. The bill will also severely affect Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem, who do not have Israeli citizenship and must live in Jerusalem to keep their residence permits. They will either have to live separately from their spouses, or move to the Occupied Territories - and lose their right to live in Jerusalem. The bill is due to be discussed by the Knesset Internal Affairs and Environment Committee on Tuesday, July 29, in an effort to pass the bill before the Knesset breaks for summer recess on August 3. Background Palestinians have long experienced difficulties in obtaining permits to join their spouses in Israel. Such difficulties have progressively worsened over the years. Some couples who have been married for a decade or more have still not been able to unify their families. These couple are thus forced to live apart, or the Palestinian spouse has to remain in Israel without a permit and be liable to arrest and deportation at any time. Since the beginning of violence in September 2000, the issuing of residence permits for Palestinian spouses has been effectively frozen. On May 12, 2002, the Israeli cabinet formalized and expanded this policy “in light of the security situation and because of the implication[s] of the immigration and the establishment in Israel of foreigners of Palestinian descent.” (Government Decision no. 1813) The government subsequently submitted the draft law on Proposed Nationality and Entry into Israel (Temporary Order) Law, 5763 – 2003 to the Knesset on June 4, 2003. The bill passed its first reading in the Knesset on June 18, 2003.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

In the past few years, the main rebel groups and the previous DRC government have been responsible for intimidating and harassing those who have exposed human rights abuses. But the new transitional government in Kinshasa offers the chance to break this pattern, Human Rights Watch said.     """"Human rights activists have put their lives on the line throughout this war, bringing to light its worst atrocities,"""" said Alison Des Forges, senior advisor to Human Rights Watch on the Great Lakes. """"The new government should protect these brave people.""""     Intimidation of human rights defenders and other activists has actually been on the increase despite the signing of a recent peace accord. The backgrounder details more than twenty cases of arrests and harassment of human rights defenders, civil society activists, and independent journalists documented by Human Rights Watch in the past three months alone.     There have also been a few positive developments lately. Earlier this month, the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) released Donatien Kisangani Mukatamwina, an Uvira-based activist who had been detained without charge for thirteen days and beaten. The RCD-Goma also authorized the independent Radio Maendeleo to resume broadcasting this month, after having banned it for the previous seven months. In response to outcries from human rights groups, the DRC government recently abolished the military court in Kinshasa, the Court d'Ordre Militaire.     """"Now is the time to turn a new page and allow human rights groups and journalists to do their jobs,"""" said Des Forges. """"If the new government is to succeed in building a lasting peace, it will have to be based on the rule of law and respect for freedom of expression.""""     Human Rights Watch also urged the new government to actively encourage the participation of human rights groups in key aspects of the transition, including justice for war crimes and crimes against humanity and a truth and reconciliation process. As a first step, Human Rights Watch urged the new minister for human rights, Marie Kalala, to hold consultations with human rights groups in different regions of the country within her first month in office.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

A Chilean court order barring a television station from broadcasting a program about a murder case violates international human rights standards, Human Rights Watch said today. A Santiago court yesterday ordered Chilean National Television not to air a program about a notorious murder case that made headlines several years ago. The case involved a Santiago lawyer who was stabbed to death in his office while entertaining prostitutes. Two sisters were arrested for the crime, and one of them, Marcela Imil, was sentenced to fifty years in prison. The show’s producer, Patricio Polanco, told Human Rights Watch that the program included compelling evidence that Marcela Imil may have been wrongfully convicted. “This ban is a clear case of prior censorship,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “Once again, a Chilean court has ignored binding protections on free expression contained in the American Convention on Human Rights.” Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights guarantees the right to “seek, receive, and impart information and ideas of all kinds.” It stipulates expressly that the exercise of this right shall not be subject to prior censorship, but only to the subsequent imposition of liability. Chile ratified the Convention in 1990. A panel of the Santiago Appeals Court barred the program on the request of the widow of the murdered lawyer. She claimed that public broadcast of the program would violate her constitutional right to honor and privacy, and that of her three children. The program, part of a prize-winning documentary crime series called Enigma: In Search of the Truth, was scheduled to air on July 23 and had been widely advertised. It reportedly includes a statement signed by Beatriz Imil confessing to the crime and insisting that her sister Marcela was innocent. It also cites a police report questioning the authenticity of key testimony incriminating Marcela. Polanco told Human Rights Watch that neither the plaintiff, nor her lawyers, nor the judges had viewed the program. Research conducted for an earlier Enigma feature led to a criminal case being reopened. As a result, a woman found to have been wrongly sentenced to fifteen years in prison was pardoned by the president. Although Chile has taken steps in recent years to bring its laws into line with international standards on free expression, its judiciary continues to lag behind.","Americas, Chile","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

South Kivu  Donatien Kisangani Mukatamwina, a human rights activist working for the Uvira-based Solidarity - Exchange for Integrated Development (SEDI), was arrested by agents of the Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD-Goma) on June 27, beaten, and detained for thirteen days without charge. He was arrested at the nearby Burundi border as he was traveling for a short visit there. A few days before his arrest, security agents of the RCD-Goma visited the SEDI office and questioned the executive secretary, Remi Ngabo, about the organization's work and its funders.  On May 28, 2003, agents of the RCD-Goma's intelligence division in Bukavu arrested Joseph Nkinzu, director of the Radio Rehema. He was detained for two days and beaten severely with a torn-up tire. Police asked him to sign an agreement not to broadcast any news that might be seen as opposed to the RCD-Goma. He was not charged with any crime. Radio Rehema is supported by the Protestant church. Nkinzu and Ben Kabamba, director of the Catholic-supported Radio Maria, had both been threatened on several occasions during April and May 2003 for broadcasting news deemed unfavorable to the RCD-Goma. The independent Radio Maendeleo was shut down from December 2002 until early July after reporting on public discontent over an RCD-Goma policy. Several of its staff members were briefly detained when the RCD-Goma first closed the radio in December.   Maitre Charles Katambayi, an active member of the bar and association of judicial defenders, was shot to death in front of his house by an RCD-Goma soldier in Uvira on May 25, 2003. The next day, a military officer (also with the RCD-Goma) located the soldier allegedly responsible for the killing and summarily executed him.  Pascal Kabungulu et Betu Kajigi of the Bukavu-based organization Héritiers de la Justice (Heirs of Justice) were threatened in May and went into hiding after exposing resource exploitation by an officer of RCD-Goma in Kamituga, Mwenga. Two of the organization's partners in Kamituga, Desire Kisuku Mwassa Bindi and Ngama Kasuku of the NGO CFGL, were arrested by the RCD-Goma on May 29, reportedly for having provided Héritiers de la Justice with information.  The umbrella group Société Civile planned marches around the country on May 10, 2003 in support of a delegation from the capital Kinshasa traveling to rebel-held areas for the first time in five years, dubbed the """"caravan of peace."""" Agents of RCD-Goma in Bukavu fired upon, beat, and arrested activists who came out in the thousands to welcome the delegation in town and at the local airport. Officials of the governor's office (who had been duly notified of the demonstration) had urged civil society leaders to call off the march in the morning when it became clear that the delegation from Kinshasa would not arrive as scheduled that day, apparently because of official opposition to the visit. One demonstrator was killed by a stray bullet, thirty-eight sustained bullet wounds, and at least seven people were arrested and detained for periods of two to seven days.   Bibiche Ntibonera, a youth activist and head of the NGO SOS-Femmes Battues that supports battered women, was arrested and severely beaten by RCD-Goma soldiers on April 11, 2003 when she tried to deliver a letter on behalf of the South Kivu Société Civile, protesting recent fighting between the RCD-Goma and a small armed group the Mududndu-40. Two weeks later, she was evacuated to a hospital in Kinshasa suffering severe consequences from the beating. RCD-Goma security agents also harassed some of the organizations that had signed the letter. They searched the offices of the children's rights organizations BAIOD and Jeunes sans Frontières on several occasions in April and May, prompting both to shut their offices. Officials in the governor's office reportedly recently encouraged Jeunes sans Frontières to resume operations, but warned against posting news bulletins on a bulletin board outside its office. Both offices remain closed.   Descartes Mponge of the organization ACADHOSHA, a Shabunda-based organization that reports on human rights violations and helps rape victims access medical care in Bukavu town, was arrested by the RCD-Goma on March 24 in Bukavu and detained for two days. He did not appear before a judge and was not informed of the reason for his detention.  North Kivu  Agents of the RCD-Goma's Directorate General of Migration arrested Valerien N'zchanzchu Kenda Kenda in Goma on May 7 and detained him for twelve days after he requested permission for members of the North Kivu branch of Société Civile to demonstrate in support of the caravan of peace. Senior RCD-Goma officials told Human Rights Watch his offense was signing the letter when his leadership of the organization had been contested. There was no march in Goma.   Richard Muhindo Bayindu, director general of CREDDHO in Goma, was arrested, beaten, and held for several hours by the RCD-Goma on April 29, 2003. Ituri  Staff of Justice Plus, a human rights organization working in Ituri, north-eastern Congo, were harassed and threatened by the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) on February 5, 2003 after their director gave an interview on international radio about human rights in Ituri. Two employees were arrested and their office equipment was seized. Some of the members of Justice Plus went into hiding fearing for their lives. The UPC claimed that members of Justice Plus were """"creating dangers for themselves."""" The two employees were later released without charge and the equipment returned after an intervention by Human Rights Watch.  Maniema  Dieudonne Muzaliwa Bulambo, a journalist with the National Radio-Television of Congo (RTNC) in Kindu was seriously beaten by RCD soldiers on May 2, 2003 after having reported that Rwandan soldiers were present in the region. The RTNC, which is affiliated with the Rwandan-backed RCD, dismissed him from his position while he was in the hospital recovering from his injuries.  Lubumbashi  A court in Likasi, some 80 miles from Lubumbashi, convicted Donatien Nyembo Kimuni of the independent newspaper La Tribune of criminal defamation on July 11, 2003 and sentenced him to five years in prison. The charges were related to an article he wrote in June about poor labor conditions for workers in the mines of the resource-rich region.   Two human rights activists, Prince Kumwamba of the African Association of Human Rights (ASADHO) and Gregoire Mulamba Tshisakamba of the Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law (CDH) and eight other civilians were acquitted by a the Court of Military Order (COM) of charges of inciting rebellion. Eight Lubumbashi residents were arrested on April 16, 2003 for being in possession of a press statement issued by local human rights groups which had criticized the continued operation of the COM in Lubumbashi, despite a government promise to abolish it throughout the country by the end of 2002. When the two activists went to COM headquarters seeking information about the eight detained persons later that day, they were arrested and had their hands bound behind their backs.   Jean Pierre Muteba, a trade unionist at the Gecamines in Lubumbashi, was briefly detained by government security agents on March 18 when participating in a seminar on natural resource exploitation. He has been a leader in the civil society movement against resource plunder.  Kinshasa  National police raided the offices of a church-run radio and television station Radiotelevision Message de vie (RTMV), which broadcasts primarily religious programming, on June 10, 2003, physically threatening the director Fernando Kutino and journalists present at the time and confiscating their broadcast equipment and transmitters. Kutino, the pastor of the movement """"Sauvons le Congo,"""" (Let Us Save the Congo) had reportedly gained a substantial popular following in the weeks leading up to the incident. RTMV remains banned.   A journalist with the independent Tropicana TV station was briefly detained and interrogated when trying to film the police dispersal of a peaceful demonstration organized by the opposition party Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) on April 23, 2003.

The same day, police detained a radio journalist Gustave Mpinganayi representing the Radio Kilimandjaro for four hours in the nearby diamond-rich village Kamonia. Earlier that day, Mpinganayi had reported on a dispute between two diamond traders.

The 29-page report, “Justice in Jeopardy: Why Mexico’s First Real Effort To Address Past Abuses Risks Becoming Its Latest Failure,” examines the shortcomings of the Special Prosecutor’s Office and concludes that its main problem has been the inadequate support it has received from the government. President Vicente Fox created the Special Prosecutor’s Office in November 2001 to investigate and prosecute human rights violations committed under previous governments. A year and half later, the office has yet to produce significant results, and there is discouraging evidence that it lacks the powers and resources necessary to manage the task it has been assigned. “When President Fox was elected three years ago, he promised a new era of accountability and respect for human rights in Mexico,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “But unless his government moves quickly to support the Special Prosecutor’s Office, that promise will go unfulfilled.” The Fox administration has repeatedly expressed its commitment to ending the climate of impunity that allowed egregious human rights violations to go unpunished in Mexico for decades. These violations included the massacres of student protesters in 1968 and 1971, and the torture, execution, and forced disappearance of hundreds of people during the country’s “dirty war” in the 1970s and early 1980s. Under international law, Mexico has a duty to investigate and prosecute these crimes. But, instead of fulfilling this obligation, government officials closed ranks to impose what one prosecutor has labeled “the big silence.” The government’s lack of support is evident in several areas: Limited access to government documents: Access to declassified documents has been seriously impaired by the way the government archives have been administered; Limited military cooperation: The Mexican military has not provided information requested by the Special Prosecutor’s office, and has interfered with the special prosecutor’s work by pursuing overlapping investigations and prosecutions of some of the same cases; Limited resources: Investigators and prosecutors within the Special Prosecutor’s Office have been operating without the material and human resources they need, given the large number and the difficulty of the cases they are handling.  The Special Prosecutor’s Office also faces a major legal hurdle that could limit its ability to prosecute the cases it is investigating. Mexican courts may find that many of the crimes can no longer be prosecuted due to the expiration of statutes of limitations. One judge has already rejected the office’s first and only request for arrest warrants on precisely these grounds. And President Fox himself confirmed this danger when he said, in November 2002, that the time allotted by statutory limitations had probably run for most of the cases under investigation. The predicament of the Special Prosecutor’s Office illustrates a more general problem with the Fox administration’s human rights goals. The report charges that the Special Prosecutor’s Office is a typical example of the kind of “half-steps” that Mexico is making in human rights. The creation of the office represented an important breakthrough for accountability in Mexico. Yet the existence of a “special” entity may have merely made it easier for the state’s “regular” institutions to duck their responsibilities, Human Rights Watch said. “The Special Prosecutor’s Office cannot be made a scapegoat for the justice system’s failure,” said Vivanco. “Although it could still have a very positive impact, this will require the full and active engagement of the government and, above all, leadership from the top.” The report makes recommendations designed to salvage the Special Prosecutor’s Office, including steps to ensure that: Declassified documents are readily available to the Special Prosecutor’s Office, as well as to the general public; Military officials provide all requested information and cease to assert jurisdiction over cases under investigation by the Special Prosecutor’s Office; Investigators and prosecutors within the Special Prosecutor’s Office receive adequate resources and training.  The Human Rights Watch report also urges President Fox to convene a task force or commission of distinguished jurists to examine the legal hurdles facing the prosecution and reach a consensus about how best to overcome them. “The Fox government has taken human rights more seriously than its predecessors,” said Vivanco. “But real change will only come when it is willing to follow through on its own initiatives. The time for doing that may be now or never.”","Americas, Mexico",""

A ceasefire among the warring parties, and the departure of indicted President Charles Taylor, are both desirable goals. But the situation is too urgent for an international force to wait for either event, Human Rights Watch said. Nor should international forces wait for “Chapter VII” peace-enforcement authority from the United Nations before acting, although the United Nations should grant such authority as quickly as possible. “Each day of delay brings only more dead and wounded in Liberia,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The time for rhetoric has passed. Troops need to be on the ground as soon as possible.” The current rebel offensive on Monrovia is the third attack in the past six weeks. The fighting has left hundreds of civilians dead or wounded and made it impossible for humanitarian agencies to provide medical care or other aid to the imperiled civilian population. Civilians have fled to Monrovia to escape fighting and abuse in the rebel-controlled countryside and, reportedly, nearly half of Liberia’s civilian population is now in the capital. The international forces should be deployed to maintain law and order in Monrovia; to protect civilians from indiscriminate and targeted attacks by rebel and government forces; and to help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need. The forces should ensure that all parties, including the peacekeeping troops, must respect international humanitarian and human rights law. Nigeria has offered to deploy two battalions, including a large number of American-trained soldiers, to Monrovia in the coming days, as a first step toward deployment by the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). But the United States, with its historical links to Liberia and its rapid response capability, must ensure that any international deployment gets underway as quickly as possible, Human Rights Watch said. “President Bush committed U.S. support to peace in Liberia, both before and during his recent trip in Africa,” said Takirambudde. “The United States should not continue to waffle on intervention.” U.S. participation should not be limited to logistical support but should include a ground presence. The presence of U.S. troops will help ensure the effectiveness of the deployment, and encourage other nations to participate in an eventual U.N.-mandated protective force, Human Rights Watch said.","Africa, United States, Liberia, US Foreign Policy",""

""""His replacement must combine the same qualities of independence and probity if this institution is to retain its critical role in bringing to light serious abuses."""" Mr. Cifuentes announced on July 21 that he would be leaving the Public Advocate's Office (Defensoría del Pueblo) to direct the human rights office of the U.N.

He had been a frequent critic of President Álvaro Uribe policies, including the suspension of basic rights in """"rehabilitation zones"""" in the departments of Arauca and Bolívar, and efforts to cut funds for public defenders to protect the poor. Mr. Cifuentes has also called on President Uribe to withdraw Colombia's objection to allowing the International Criminal Court to consider cases involving war crimes in Colombia. More recently, Mr. Cifuentes raised concerns that the Uribe government's negotiations with paramilitary groups may allow individuals who have committed crimes against humanity to escape justice. President Uribe must now choose a slate of three candidates for Public Advocate, from which the Colombian Congress will make a final selection. Human Rights Watch said all candidates should possess the following qualifications: A solid background in human rights, including direct, practical experience of human rights monitoring and field operations; The personal integrity, standing, and capacity necessary to demonstrate moral leadership, and the strength of purpose and willingness to confront gross human rights abusers publicly when necessary; and An established reputation in Colombia as a leader of stature, commensurate with the importance of human rights issues in the country.  Human Rights Watch said President Uribe should consider candidates who would see the post of Public Advocate as the pinnacle of their career, not as a stepping-stone to a higher post.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/22/nigeria-no-justice-kaduna-killings","Nigeria- No Justice For Kaduna Killings","Nigeria: No Justice For Kaduna Killings","","07/22/2003","(Abuja, July 22, 2003) – Not a single member of the Nigerian police or security forces has been charged with dozens of killings during the “Miss World” riots in Kaduna last November, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today. The 32-page report, “The ‘Miss World riots': continued impunity for killings in Kaduna,” provides detailed eyewitness accounts of how soldiers and police killed people in cold blood between November 21 and 23, during an operation intended to restore law and order. One of the most serious cases described in the report is the November 22 execution of eight men by a group of police and military, led by a member of a local defense force. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch how the perpetrators picked out their victims one by one, tied them together, led them to a rubbish dump by a riverside and shot them dead at close range. Fighting between Muslims and Christians broke out in the northern city of Kaduna in November 2002 following controversy around the Miss World beauty contest. Some Muslims considered an article in the newspaper ThisDay to be blasphemous. Muslim youths started attacking Christians, Christians retaliated, and within three days, around 250 people were killed. “The Nigerian government has not brought anyone to justice for these terrible killings,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “This lack of response raises serious questions about the government´s commitment to protecting the lives of ordinary Nigerians.” Not only did the security forces fail to intervene at the first signs of violence, but once they were deployed, they contributed significantly to the violence by killing and injuring people who were not posing any threat to security. For reasons that remain unknown, orders were not given to deploy special military “strike force” units, which had been stationed in Kaduna since 2000 with the specific aim of averting such clashes. When confronted with rioters, the police and soldiers who were deployed often made no attempt to arrest criminal suspects, instead shooting them dead on the spot. The victims included children. In several cases, the security forces shot people arbitrarily. One man was shot dead by a soldier without warning as he was trying to enter his house in the Nasarawa area. According to eyewitnesses, the soldier shot him in the chest, from the front, then walked away. The victim was unarmed. The police executed several other people, in some cases after forcing their way into their homes. In several cases, eyewitnesses claimed to have identified the perpetrators. In response to complaints from local residents, the police said they were launching investigations into some of these cases. However, police threatened and intimidated witnesses who gave statements to them. Several policemen were arrested, but were released within a few days and posted elsewhere. Human Rights Watch does not know of any case that has resulted in formal charges or prosecution. The Human Rights Watch report also describes well-organized attacks by Muslim and Christian youths during the three days of violence. Youths of both faiths singled out their victims and attacked them purely on the basis of their religion. In addition to killing scores of people, they destroyed many buildings, including churches, mosques, schools and homes. “Like the security forces, the people who organized and carried out the riots have not been brought to justice,” said Takirambudde. Around 350 people were arrested in connection with the riots, but most were released within a short period. No one has been charged or tried for organizing the violence. The Human Rights Watch report concludes that the conflict in Kaduna was more political than religious and stemmed from unresolved disputes between different ethnic and political groups. It links the 2002 riots to clashes between Muslims and Christians in Kaduna in 2000, in which more than 2,000 people were killed following disagreements over the introduction of Sharia (Islamic law). “The Miss World issue was just the trigger,” said Takirambudde. “Sooner or later, violence in Kaduna would have erupted again anyway, because the government has never satisfactorily addressed the underlying tensions which caused such massive loss of life in 2000.” The report makes a number of recommendations to the Nigerian government including: Investigating and bringing to justice those responsible for the killings in Kaduna in November 2002, including those who planned the inter-communal violence, and members of the Nigerian security forces. Immediately suspending from active duty individual members of the police and military reported to have committed killings, pending investigation and prosecution. Issuing clear instructions to the police and the military that operations to restore law and order are never a justification for extrajudicial killings, and that every effort should be made to arrest criminal suspects without using lethal force. Intensifying efforts to prevent inter-communal violence, including by supporting grassroots initiatives to foster dialogue between Muslims and Christians, and making a concerted effort to listen to the grievances of local communities.","Africa, Nigeria",""

The U.N. team arrived in Guatemala City last week. The U.N. team will assess the viability of the proposed Commission of Investigation into Illegal Groups and Clandestine Security Apparatuses (CICIACS), which has been endorsed by the government, the human rights ombudsman, and civil society groups in Guatemala. “The proposal for a commission has the support of all the key actors in Guatemala,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “Everyone is now hoping that the U.N. team of experts will find the best way to make it work.” The role of the proposed commission is to investigate political violence committed by clandestine groups. Over the past three years, there have been an alarming number of attacks and threats against human rights defenders, academic researchers, justice officials, lawyers, witnesses, journalists, and union leaders in Guatemala. There is a widespread consensus among local and international observers that the perpetrators of these acts of violence and intimidation belong to—or are affiliated with—clandestine groups of some form. The clandestine groups believed responsible for such acts appear to have links with both state agents and organized crime. Human Rights Watch said they pose a significant danger, not only to specific individuals and organizations, but also Guatemalan society as a whole, given their capacity to corrupt public institutions and undermine the rule of law. In recent weeks, Guatemala has seen a wave of attacks and threats against journalists, including José Rubén Zamora and Juan Luis Font, directors of the newspaper el Periódico. “The recent attacks have shown that Guatemala needs this sort of investigative commission now more than ever,” said Vivanco.","Americas, Guatemala","United Nations"

In January 2003, the Slovak Government Office of Human Rights and Minorities filed a criminal complaint to investigate illegal sterilization practices against Romani women. The complaint was in response to the testimonies contained in the report Body and Soul: Forced Sterilization and Other Assaults on Roma Reproductive Freedom in Slovakia, published by the Center for Reproductive Rights and Poradna pre obcianske a ludske prava. A press release issued by the same office on January 28, 2003, also noted that criminal proceedings would commence against the authors of the report under the Slovak Criminal Code for failure to inform law enforcement authorities of criminal activities if the findings of the report were found to be true and for “spreading of false rumors and creating panic in society” if the findings of the report were found to be false. On June 23, 2003, the Slovak government reported to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the steps undertaken by the Slovak authorities to address these violations. The report informed the Parliamentary Assembly of the criminal and administrative investigations being conducted into allegations of forced and coerced sterilization in Slovakia and stated the Slovak government’s assurance that it will not pursue criminal proceedings against the authors of Body and Soul. The NGOs listed above urge the Slovak government to address key problems regarding the investigative process and recommend the formation of an independent commission of inquiry into allegations of illegal sterilization. Complaint Against Human Rights Defenders Amnesty International, the Center for Reproductive Rights, the European Roma Rights Center, Human Rights Watch, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, Konzorcium Urobme to, Ludia proti rasizmu, Poradna pre obcianske a ludske prava and Slovensky helsinsky vybor (hereinafter “we”) welcome the Slovak government’s recognition of the internationally protected right of human rights defenders to document and report violations and to engage in the promotion and protection of human rights, as evidenced by its decision not to pursue the criminal complaint against the authors of Body and Soul. By attacking those who defend the interests of Romani women and by implying that the Romani women’s testimonies in Body and Soul are false, the criminal investigation against the authors of Body and Soul had the effect of intimidating and threatening the Romani community. It is very likely that the criminal investigation may have inhibited or prevented victims of illegal sterilization from filing civil or criminal complaints or cooperating with investigators for fear of facing retribution. We call on the Slovak government to ensure, through affirmative publicity, that the Romani community is fully aware that the criminal complaint against the authors of the report will not be pursued. Criminal Investigation The launch of the investigation into illegal sterilization practices is a positive response by the government. The manner in which the criminal investigation is being conducted, however, has been problematic in the following respects: it appears to have reached hasty conclusions before investigating all relevant crimes in connection with sterilization, ignored key evidence, including absence of informed consent, and has created an intimidating atmosphere for victims that has tended to dissuade them from coming forward. The investigation must be impartial and thorough and must respect the rule of law. Thus, we call on the Slovak law enforcement authorities to: Investigate all cases of alleged illegal sterilization throughout the post-communist period, including in all hospitals throughout the country; Investigate all relevant crimes in connection with cases of alleged illegal sterilization, including those violations related to the rights to health care, bodily integrity and reproductive self-determination; Examine the circumstances under which consent was given and not rely solely on a signature as evidence of consent. According to international standards and international medical associations, a signature alone is not de facto evidence of full and informed consent and there is no immediate threat to health that would require a doctor to perform sterilization without the full and informed consent of the patient; and Criminally prosecute those responsible for violations, including, but not limited to, all cases where sterilizations were preformed on minors without the consent of the legal guardian as required by Slovak law. We welcome the commitment of the Slovak government to carry out the investigation with ‘ethnic sensitivity,’ as reported to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and urge it to proceed with the investigation in a manner that respects the rule of law, including the rights of victims to be treated with dignity. Commission of Inquiry Slovakia must confront the past and present illegal sterilization practices in order to move towards a future that respects human rights. A commission of inquiry is needed to shed historical light on the specifics of why and how illegal sterilizations were and are being performed in Slovakia. Nations that have had similar policies and practices of forced and coerced sterilization have realized the need to acknowledge and address this issue or risk continuing harm to their societies. For example, Norway, Sweden, and the United States are confronting the truth with regards to past sterilization policies and practices which resulted in grave violations of reproductive rights of certain groups. They have set up or are setting up commissions to survey the extent of the practice, to offer recommendations for reform, and to compensate persons whose rights have been violated. In these countries, there had been virtually no present-day allegations of such practices, yet responsible government officials understood the need to address past harms. We call on the Slovak government to establish a commission of inquiry independent of the criminal investigation to inquire into past and present sterilization practices. The body’s mandate should be to investigate the full extent of the practice of coerced and forced sterilization in the communist and post-communist periods; propose legal and institutional measures to prevent the recurrence of the practice; and to recommend financial and other reparation for victims. The body should be comprised of independent and highly qualified medical and legal experts, as well as members of civil society and of the Romani community. Experts should be drawn primarily from Slovakia, but should include members of the international community. Conclusion The rights to have control over one’s reproductive capacity and to bodily integrity are fundamental human rights that have been denied to many Romani women in Slovakia. Their rights to informed consent to sterilization, accurate and comprehensive health information, and non-discriminatory health services have been violated. As a member of the international community and party to international human rights treaties, Slovakia has a duty to rigorously investigate, end, and remedy the human rights violations committed within its borders.","Europe/Central Asia, Slovak Republic","Women's Rights"

""""Men remain imprisoned in Egypt for private acts, in a continuing crackdown which violates international law,"""" said Scott Long, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"What is needed is to repeal the provisions of a law which invite repressive enforcement."""" The men were among sixteen who had been charged in February 2003, when police tapped the phone of a private apartment in the Giza district of greater Cairo after an informer reported that the owner was visited by other men. Police arrested the men whose recorded conversations suggested that they had engaged in homosexual acts. They were charged with the """"habitual practice of debauchery,"""" punishable by up to three years' imprisonment under Law 10/1961. """"Debauchery"""" [fujur] in the law is understood to criminalize consensual, non-commercial homosexual sex. The men were tortured in detention. One told Human Rights Watch that they were held in isolation for fifteen days in the women's section of the Giza police station; there, guards beat them three times daily, at every change of shift. Thirteen men eventually appeared at trial; three more in hiding were tried in absentia. Only two were acquitted by the trial court April 17, 2003; the rest received sentences of from one to three and a half years' imprisonment. While overturning the sentences of the eleven men who appealed, Judge Mo'azer al-Marsary said, """"We are so disgusted with you, we can't even look at you. What you did is a major sin, but unfortunately the case has procedural errors and the court has to acquit all of you."""" """"We welcome the acquittals,"""" said Long, """"but judges have a duty to affirm the rights of the accused rather than engaging in prejudicial rhetoric and hiding behind technicalities."""" Activists in Egypt report that official solicitation and arrests of suspected gay men over the Internet have continued in recent months. Appeals courts have a record of overturning """"debauchery"""" convictions in Egypt, when based on flimsy evidence or official solicitation. However, some appeals fail. Human Rights Watch is concerned by the continuing imprisonment of Zaki Saad Zaki Abd al-Malak, a 23-year-old resident of Ismailia who was solicited by police over the Internet in January 2002. After corresponding with a man through an MSN chatroom, Malak came to Cairo to meet him; at their prearranged meeting place, Vice Squad officers arrested him. He told human rights activists that police beat him daily during two weeks of detention in the Agouza Police Station. At one meeting with his lawyer, dried blood still crusted his face. On February 7, 2002, Malak was convicted of the """"habitual practice of debauchery,"""" as well as advertising """"against public morals"""" and """"inciting passers-by … to commit indecent acts."""" He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment, followed by three years' police supervision. The sentence was upheld on appeal. A further appeal is pending before the Cassation Court, Egypt's highest judicial review body. Meanwhile, Malak is being held in Borg al-Arab prison near Alexandria. On February 17, 2003, a Cairo appeals court upheld a penal sentence against Wissam Toufic Abyad, a 26-year-old Lebanese citizen. Police arrested Abyad on January 16 in Cairo's Heliopolis district after he had arranged to meet with a """"Raoul,"""" whom he had met through a gay personals-advertisement site on the Internet. Undercover police and informants have used the nickname """"Raoul"""" in several other cases to solicit suspected homosexual men. The Heliopolis Court of Misdemeanors sentenced Abyad on January 20 to one year and three months' imprisonment, under the same three charges used against Zaki Saad Zaki Abd al-Malak.

The July 22 Cooperation Council meetings constitute the single most important bilateral encounters of the year between the EU and Kazakhstan, and between the EU and Kyrgyzstan. They shape the EU’s engagement with its Central Asian partners, under the framework of its Partnership and Cooperation Agreements with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Both Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan have consistently flouted the human rights criteria in their Partnership and Cooperation Agreements with the EU, Human Rights Watch said. In a letter sent to EU foreign ministers in advance of the meetings, Human Rights Watch urged the EU to seek concrete commitments from the two governments to improve their poor human rights records. “These meetings are the EU’s chance to get concrete results from its Central Asian partners,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “If the EU agrees to dialogue without tangible progress, that could actually undermine efforts toward human rights and democracy in these countries.” Basic rights protection has deteriorated dramatically in both Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan during the past year. Recent Human Rights Watch investigations found that both governments have repressed political opposition, silenced independent media, and resisted international efforts to promote reform. “As preparations for the Cooperation Council meetings proceed, political pluralism and freedom of expression in these countries are eroding,” said Andersen. “Now is the time to reverse these negative trends.” Human Rights Watch urged the EU to use the upcoming meetings to insist on the following specific steps: Release from prison Kazakh political opposition leader Galimzhan Zhakianov, Kazakh journalist Sergei Duvanov, and Kyrgyz political opposition leader Feliks Kulov, all of whom are being held on charges that appear to be politically motivated; Allow for an independent and impartial review of all criminal cases brought against members of the political opposition; Rescind criminal defamation laws, including those that currently allow government officials to bring claims of insult to “honor and dignity” when they are called to account for corruption and abuse of office; In the case of Kazakhstan, agree on a firm deadline for registration of opposition political parties;  In the case of Kazakhstan, sign and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Both governments should also be urged to follow the EU’s example to issue standing invitations to all U.N. human rights monitors. In the case of Kyrgyzstan, allow an international investigation into the use of lethal force by police against demonstrators in March 2002; despite apparent indications of progress last year, those who shot and killed five demonstrators have not been brought to justice for that crime. Human Rights Watch also recommended that the EU coordinate its Central Asia policy closely with other governments and organizations active in the region, including the United States and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). One example of such cooperation would be for the EU to enlist former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the OSCE’s special envoy to Central Asia, to track specific steps taken by the Kazakh and Kyrgyz governments to bring themselves into compliance with the human rights requirements of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements. “The EU has used strong words in the past to acknowledge the abuse taking place in Central Asia,” said Andersen. “Now it needs to take the next step, to insist on concrete measures to roll back this latest wave of abuse.”","Europe/Central Asia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan",""

Human Rights Watch called on Cambodian authorities to swiftly suspend officials who are responsible for such threats and election law violations. In a new briefing paper, Human Rights Watch found that village and commune chiefs, most of whom are members of Prime Minister Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP), are threatening opposition party supporters with violence, expulsion from their villages, and denial of access to community resources. Threats range from being rejected for village rice distributions to having land confiscated for voting for the opposition. Intimidation is directed at political party members, local activists, and voters. """"While the ruling Cambodian People's Party has used violence in previous elections, in the current campaign, it appears to have chosen a more subtle strategy to coerce villagers from voting their preference,"""" said James Ross, senior legal advisor at Human Rights Watch. """"Such coercion is more difficult, especially for international observers, to detect, document, and quantify."""" Human Rights Watch said that there does appear to be a welcome decrease in the levels of overt political violence, but that this did not necessarily translate into overall greater respect for basic civil and political rights. The government's failure to prosecute those responsible for past acts of political violence has created an atmosphere where less violent forms of intimidation are nonetheless effective. """"Cambodians know that it is very risky to support the political opposition, particularly out in the provinces,"""" Ross said. """"If crimes are committed, they believe that little will be done to bring the perpetrators to justice, especially if the perpetrators are local officials."""" The 21-page briefing paper, based on research conducted in six provinces, includes three in-depth case studies. For example: Violence and Impunity: In Takeo, a widow has endured political persecution from local officials ever since five members of her Funcinpec-affiliated family were murdered in 1997. The perpetrator, a commune militia man, was never arrested. Others in her village, keenly aware of the legacy of impunity, expressed their anxieties about the elections. It is not a time to engage in political debate, they said, but """"a time to keep quiet. We have to live with her story every day."""" Intimidation Tactics: In Kompong Cham, an opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) rally triggered a wave of political intimidation against participants. Local officials recorded the names of those who attended the rally, denied them access to rice distributions, and failed to investigate when a key SRP activist's water well was poisoned. """"How can we know we will be safe to vote the way we want to?"""" the activist wondered. """"Gift"""" Giving: In Siem Reap, """"gift"""" giving campaigns organized by the CPP are considerably more insidious than traditional vote buying. Voters have been assembled on the promise of getting gifts but found instead that they were forced to publicly renounce any other party loyalties and swear their allegiance to the CPP. In at least one case, villagers received what they thought were cash gifts from CPP officials but learned later they were loans to be repaid--if the CPP loses.  Human Rights Watch's recommendations to the Cambodian government in the time remaining before the July 27 polling day include: Make use of the national media to reinforce the message that voters can cast their ballots for whomever they choose, regardless of the receipt of gifts, the statement of an oath, or any other forced affiliation. Immediately arrange for the National Election Committee to hold public meetings at the village level to assure voters that they will be treated equally regardless of the outcome of the vote. Move quickly to begin prosecuting serious violations of the Law on the Election of the National Assembly, especially those committed by candidates and party officials.  Human Rights Watch called on all political parties to refrain from using inflammatory or racist rhetoric and to do their utmost to report accurately on violations. Human Rights Watch encouraged international donors, particularly those concerned about human rights, and especially those that have financially supported the elections, to insist that the Cambodian government promptly investigate and prosecute all election violations. """"Election observers must be alert to all abuses--subtle forms of intimidation as well as blatant violence,"""" said Ross. """"And the international community must be ready to loudly voice their concerns, should the abuses of past elections be repeated, or new ways of depriving Cambodians their right to vote take their place.""""","Asia, Cambodia",""

ECOWAS is poised to send 1,000-1,500 peacekeeping troops to Liberia; we urge you to ensure that this force acts in full accordance with international human rights and humanitarian law, and with a clear mandate to protect civilians and to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid.   The history of ECOWAS peacekeeping operations in the subregion has been mixed. Important successes have been offset by serious human rights abuses and a lack of accountability. ECOWAS must commit itself to ensuring its troops are adequately trained and able to meet their obligations under human rights and humanitarian law and to investigate and prosecute any officers or soldiers implicated in abuses. At its April 1999 summit in Abuja, ECOWAS pledged to conduct an investigation into ECOMOG abuses in Sierra Leone, especially those associated with the January 1999 rebel offensive. At this writing, no investigation has taken place. It is therefore critical that the ECOWAS leadership and governments contributing troops publicly commit themselves to respecting international law.   Human Rights Watch has documented human rights abuses by all sides to the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone, including abuses by ECOWAS forces, known as ECOMOG. In Liberia, ECOMOG helped restore security, which resulted in an improvement in the human rights situation. However ECOMOG became complicit in serious abuses through its alliance with abusive warring factions, and ECOMOG troops were responsible for extensive looting, harassment and arbitrary detention of civilians. ECOMOG forces also violated international humanitarian law by conducting indiscriminate air strikes against civilians and civilian objects, including violations of medical neutrality. To our knowledge, none of these abuses was ever investigated, and no ECOMOG troops were held accountable.   The record of ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone constituted an improvement over its conduct in Liberia. Nevertheless, ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone were responsible for serious abuses, including summary executions of suspected rebels or collaborators, use of child soldiers, and indiscriminate bombings against civilians. Officers to the level of captain were present and sometimes participated in these executions. ECOMOG troops violated medical neutrality during a January 11, 1999 operation in which they stormed a hospital, proceeded to drag wounded rebels from their beds, and executed them on hospital grounds. ECOMOG troops were found to have sexually exploited women and solicited child prostitutes.   In light of this history, we would like to make the following recommendations to ECOWAS as it prepares for a new peacekeeping operation in Liberia:  Ensure that the ECOWAS force has a robust mandate to protect civilians, and that they facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid; Ensure that ECOWAS forces fully abide by international humanitarian law, particularly with respect to the protection of civilians and civilian objects;  Provide all soldiers and officers to be deployed by ECOWAS with appropriate training in international human rights and humanitarian law before they are sent to Liberia; Include a unit of advisors with particular expertise in international humanitarian law to deploy with ECOWAS forces in an advisory capacity;  Cooperate with the U.N. Peace-Building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL), whose mandate should be revised and strengthened to include human rights monitoring and investigation, public reporting, and the raising of individual cases of abuse with the Liberian authorities, the leadership of the rebel groups, or the relevant authorities for any foreign troops deployed in the country; Establish a disciplinary unit to oversee the imposition of military discipline within the various ECOWAS contingents to address violations of international humanitarian law and other serious abuses by ECOWAS troops;  Demobilize and disarm all child soldiers, and hand them over to the appropriate child protection agency.  Thank you for your attention to these important matters. Please let us know if we can be of any further assistance.

""""This is an extremely disappointing decision,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The court has endorsed an antiquated concept of public order that disregards essential freedoms on which democracy is based."""" In a ruling issued on July 15, the court held that although the Venezuelan Constitution prohibits censorship, it nonetheless had an implicit exception for prior censorship of war propaganda, and of material that was discriminatory or promoted religious intolerance. The court also declared that laws protecting public authorities and institutions from insulting criticism (so-called insult laws or leyes de desacato, in Spanish) were constitutional. The ruling was made in a case brought by a private citizen who argued that several articles of the country's Criminal Code violated the Venezuelan Constitution. Under Articles 148 and 149 of the Venezuelan Criminal Code, people can be imprisoned for insulting """"by speech or in writing"""" the president, the vice-president, the president of the legislature, the chief justice, and numerous other government officials, or by showing them """"lack of respect in any other way."""" Article 150 prohibits anyone from insulting the legislature, the judiciary or the cabinet. The higher the rank of the offended party, the stiffer the sentence: anyone who insults the president publicly can be jailed for up to three years and three months. In upholding these laws, the court reasoned that """"anyone who presents a state dignitary in an undignified light tends to weaken the functions they exercise, at least in public opinion, potentially contributing to a state of pre-anarchy."""" Other articles of the Criminal Code whose constitutionality was upheld give special protection to legislators and public servants, including the police, from offensive criticism. Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights states that propaganda for war and advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred shall be punishable by law. But it also expressly prohibits prior censorship, establishing that those who violate lawful restrictions on expression be held responsible by law only after the event. In 1995 the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights published a report on insult laws that concluded that """"the special protection desacato laws afford public functionaries from insulting or offensive criticism is not congruent with the objective of a democratic society to foster public debate."""" Several Latin American countries, including Argentina, Paraguay, Costa Rica and Peru, have followed the Commission's recommendations and removed insult provisions from their statute books. The Venezuelan Supreme Court, however, took pains to point out that it did not have to follow the Commission's recommendations. """"It bodes ill for Venezuelan democracy that the court views criticism and a vibrant public debate as a possible threat to public order.

In one of its first acts, the new Iraqi Governing Council announced the formation of a commission to establish a tribunal to bring Saddam and his henchmen to justice. Sadly, this is the wrong approach. The mass graves being unearthed today in Iraq bespeak the horrors of his rule. Among the occupants of these graves are 100,000 Kurdish men and boys machine-gunned to death during the 1988 Anfal genocide; 30,000 Shiites and Kurds slaughtered after the 1991 uprising; other Shiites killed during the 1980s because of their perceived sympathy for Iran; so-called Marsh Arabs, killed as the Iraqi government drained the marshes and destroyed a culture that had thrived for centuries; and many individual Iraqis of all faiths and ethnicities who were singled out, their lives ended, for real or perceived opposition to the regime. Whatever one thinks of the war to topple Saddam Hussein, the issue of justice for the crimes of his regime is now coming to the fore. In one of its first acts, the new Iraqi Governing Council announced the formation of a commission to establish a tribunal to bring Saddam and his henchmen to justice. Sadly, this is the wrong approach. At a certain level, one can applaud the move. Contrast it with Afghanistan, for example, where the crimes of the Taliban and its predecessors have been swept under the rug because of fears that prosecution would lead to many of the people behind the government of Hamid Karzai. However, the approach of the Governing Council — taking its cue from Washington's preference of allowing Iraqis to try their own persecutors — is unlikely to produce sound prosecutions or fair trials. It reflects less a determination to see justice done than a fear of bucking Washington's ideological jihad against any form of international justice. As we know from Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, prosecutions of genocide or crimes against humanity are enormously complex. Volumes of official documents must be amassed, sensitive forensic evidence must be collected from mass graves, hundreds of witnesses from among survivors and accomplices must be presented, and scrupulous attention paid to the requirements of due process. To avoid being perceived as show trials or “victor's justice,” these prosecutions, and the resulting trials, demand highly experienced jurists of unquestioned integrity. Saddam's brutal and arbitrary justice system can hardly be expected to have produced such jurists. Prosecutions were typically based on confessions, often induced by torture. Serious criminal investigations were virtually unheard of. Even among Iraqi exiles, it will be difficult to find jurists with the right combination of skills and emotional distance from the former dictatorship. And the problem will only be compounded if the Governing Council selects the judges and prosecutor, since they will be seen as Washington's designees rather than independent dispensers of justice. An internationally led tribunal would be a far better option for Iraq, whether a fully international tribunal as the ones established for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia or a mixed national-international tribunal as the one set up for Sierra Leone. Because its personnel would be selected by the United Nations rather than by Washington's surrogates, an internationally led tribunal is more likely to be seen as legitimate. And because it can draw from a global pool of talent, it is better able to secure experienced and fair-minded jurists. At minimum, the UN Security Council should establish an international commission of experts to decide on the best type of tribunal for Iraq. Such a commission could consult with large numbers of Iraqis as well as experienced war-crimes prosecutors from around the world about the justice mechanism that would best serve Iraq's needs. As similar commissions did in Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, it could also begin the urgent task of preserving evidence — both the internal documents that Saddam's government meticulously kept, and the mass graves that U.S. troops are now allowing to be despoiled. Washington is adamantly opposed to such an approach, which probably explains the decision taken by the Governing Council. But Washington's opposition reflects its ideology, not its concern for the Iraqi people. The Bush administration calculates that a tribunal of Iraqis selected by its hand-picked Council will be easier to control, more likely to impose the death penalty, and, most important, less likely to indirectly enhance the legitimacy of the detested International Criminal Court. Canada, whose diplomat Phillippe Kirsch was recently chosen to preside over the International Criminal Court, should speak for Saddam's victims and oppose this U.S. approach. The Iraqi people, in their longstanding quest for a fair and independent justice system, deserve no less.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/17/argentina-letter-president-kirchner","Argentina- Letter to President Kirchner","Argentina: Letter to President Kirchner","","07/17/2003","President Néstor Carlos Kirchner  President of Argentina  Casa Rosada  Balcarse 24  Buenos Aires, Argentina AAB1064   I am writing on behalf of Human Rights Watch regarding new initiatives that your government has taken or is actively considering in the field of human rights. We have been greatly encouraged by your recognition of the need for justice and accountability in the construction of a more democratic society, and your insistence that government processes be transparent and open to public scrutiny.   This year may be an important turning point for justice in Argentina. For many years, because of laws designed to shield military officers from prosecution, the relatives of the thousands of victims of the military repression from 1976 to 1983 were denied justice. Recently, however, a few federal judges have recognized that the Full Stop and Due Obedience Laws, enacted in 1986 and 1987 in the face of a threatened military rebellion, are unconstitutional and inconsistent with Argentina's international human rights obligations.   Human Rights Watch, jointly with Amnesty International and the International Commission of Jurists submitted an amicus curiae brief on June 1, 2001 to the National Criminal Court in support of the legal challenge to the laws. We were pleased, therefore, when the court affirmed the trial courts' view that the laws were unconstitutional. Now the cases in question are before the Supreme Court, which must rule soon on the issue. If the court decides that the relatives of the thousands of victims have a right to justice, it will be a historic decision.   If, however, the Supreme Court upholds the amnesty laws, there would little possibility of bringing to trial in Argentina those responsible for the grave and systematic human rights violations committed during military rule. Indeed, it was the prevailing climate of impunity created by those laws that motivated relatives of some victims to seek justice abroad, for example in courts in Spain, France, and Italy. Many of the countries in which cases were brought have since requested that Argentine citizens be extradited to stand trial for the crimes in question.   Regrettably, successive Argentine governments have adopted a policy of rejecting such requests on grounds of """"territoriality,"""" arguing that crimes committed on Argentine territory must be judged only by national courts. This doctrine was formalized in Decree 1581, issued by President Fernando De la Rúa in December 2001, days before his resignation. We have learned that your government intends shortly to amend or repeal this decree, a decision that we warmly welcome.   We believe that there are two fundamental principles to be observed in considering extradition requests in cases involving grave human rights violations; first, that these cases should be decided on an individual basis, and second that the decision should be taken according to the principle of aut dedere, aut judicare: either extradite or prosecute. Until now, the trial in Argentina of those responsible for """"disappearances"""" has been impossible for the legal reasons noted above. Effectively, by rejecting extradition requests out of hand on territorial grounds, previous governments reinforced and extended the effects of the amnesty laws. Besides, by rejecting extradition requests in limine, Decree 1581 bars the courts from deciding each case on its merits.   With regard to transparency, we would also like to express our appreciation of other initiatives taken by your government. We welcome, for example, your decision to declassify the files of the Secretariat of State Intelligence (SIDE) on the bomb attack of July 18, 1994, on the Asociación Mutual Israelí Argentina (AMIA), and to make these documents available to the courts. Their declassification is not only important for the light the documents may throw on a horrific crime in which eighty-five persons died. It may also help to clarify the constant allegations of corruption and abuse that have for years surrounded this highly secret government department.   We are also very pleased that your government has ordered an official investigation into allegations that the government of President Juan Domingo Perón colluded in helping former Nazi war criminals escape to Argentina from Germany after World War II. Your predecessors have made such undertakings in past years, but until now the results of official inquiries have yielded meager results. We hope that the National Institute Against Discrimination, the agency placed in charge of investigating immigration documents, will be able to clarify the facts. We trust that all government departments, including the Secretariat of State Intelligence, will cooperate in this effort by making available the documentation required by the Institute.   Finally, with regard to the Supreme Court, we support your position announced on June 19 in favor of increasing the transparency of the appointments process. By allowing civil society organizations the opportunity to comment on Supreme Court nominees, and by requiring nominees to answer questions in public hearings in the Senate, the process of choosing Supreme Court justices will involve greater public debate and hence be more open and democratic. It goes without saying that the nomination of the distinguished jurist and academic, Professor Eugenio Raúl Zaffaroni, as a candidate for the Supreme Court, is excellent news.   Human Rights Watch knows that the effort to achieve justice and accountability in Argentina has been long and arduous. We are hopeful that under your leadership the country will advance significantly so that the thousands of Argentines who suffered human rights violations during military rule will at last find justice in their own country.

In a letter and fact sheet submitted to the EBRD in advance of its first high-level visit to the Uzbek capital since the annual meeting it held there in May, Human Rights Watch outlined numerous incidents of harassment and intimidation of human rights defenders who had used the event to speak out against abuse. The fact sheet also highlights a number of serious setbacks to human rights that have marred Uzbekistan’s human rights landscape since the annual meeting, including two deaths from torture in state custody and politically motivated arrests of two human rights defenders. The visit, to be carried out by the Bank’s newly-appointed Secretary-General, is scheduled to begin on July 21. “The Bank has trumpeted the annual meeting as a success without any acknowledgment of the shortcomings that took place,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “It is time to recognize that while some things went right, a lot of things went wrong and need to be addressed.” As a first step, Human Rights Watch called on the EBRD to firmly condemn retributions targeting human rights defenders who attended the meeting or organized peaceful protests in conjunction with it, and to intervene publicly on behalf of those who face reprisals for speaking their minds at the meeting. Among such cases is that of Akhmadjon Madmarov, a defender whose imprisoned son was placed in solitary confinement after Madmarov spoke out about persecution of his family. In another incident, several weeks after the annual meeting, anonymous callers began asking Dilobar Khudoiberganova of the nongovernmental organization Mothers against the Death Penalty and Torture, why she participated in meetings and conferences. A National Security Service officer subsequently called Khudoiberganova’s father, threatening to arrest one of his sons if Khudoiberganova continued her human rights activities. “Developments in Uzbekistan since the annual meeting certainly don’t make for a pretty picture,” said Andersen. “The Bank should not seek to downplay the repercussions that people are now facing for speaking out. These brave individuals deserve recognition and public defense, even if that means the annual meeting doesn’t go down in history as an unqualified success.” Human Rights Watch urged the EBRD to formulate specific steps for reform that the Uzbek government needs to undertake in order to satisfy the three human rights benchmarks set in the Bank’s country strategy, adopted in March. The strategy identified three areas in which progress is needed, and set a one-year deadline for compliance. They are: (1) greater political openness and freedom of the media; (2) registration and free functioning of independent civil society groups; and (3) improvements in the country’s human rights record, including through implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture. In its letter to the EBRD, Human Rights Watch suggested twelve specific steps that would constitute progress in meeting these benchmarks, including legalization of all Uzbek nongovernmental organizations registered to participate in the annual meeting. Human Rights Watch further urged the EBRD to take an active role in establishing a coherent and transparent follow-up process, involving the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the United Nations, Tashkent-based embassies, and civil society organizations. In order to sustain the momentum for reform, Human Rights Watch called on the Bank to conduct multiple visits to Uzbekistan in the course of the year, and to issue periodic public assessments of the government’s progress in meeting the benchmarks. “We don’t want the Bank to use the benchmarks simply as a basis to declare failure next spring, but to see it actively push for their fulfillment throughout these months ahead,” said Andersen.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"

Human Rights Watch said Ibrahim has been held for three months while a dubious investigation into his use of the Internet proceeds. Ibrahim turned himself over to State Security Investigations (SSI) on April 19, 2003, two days after SSI agents raided his home and confiscated his computer, video camera, scanner, and other electronic equipment, along with many of his books and papers. His jailing was renewed for another fifteen-day period by prosecutors on July 14. “Ashraf Ibrahim is being persecuted because he exercised basic freedoms to speak his mind and assemble with others in protest,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The Egyptian authorities should release him immediately.” Prosecutors have not referred the case to a court. They told Ibrahim and his attorneys that he is being investigated for downloading information on human rights from the Internet and downloading material from the website of al-Jazeera news service, and other alleged offenses. Prosecutors have not indicated under what provisions of Egypt’s criminal code these activities might constitute an offense. “Accessing news and human rights information from the Internet is a basic right, not a crime,” Stork said. Ibrahim, an engineer by profession, is an activist with the Popular Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian Uprising. He participated in several Cairo demonstrations against the war in Iraq this spring. He also serves as secretary of the Association on Health and Environmental Development, an Egyptian non-governmental organization. His arrest came after a month-long crackdown in which hundreds of antiwar and pro-Palestinian demonstrators were detained. Sixty-nine people still face criminal charges, but all except Ibrahim have been freed on bail. Ibrahim has been held at Mahkum Tora prison, near Cairo. He reportedly shares a cell with approximately forty criminal convicts—in violation of international standards that require pre-trial detainees to be separated from convicted prisoners. Ibrahim has appeared seven times before prosecutors at the State Security Prosecution Office in Heliopolis, Cairo, most recently on July 14. Each time the prosecution has renewed his detention for an additional fifteen days. At a prosecution interrogation on June 29, Ibrahim accused prosecutors of bias, and demanded to appear before an investigating judge to review his detention. Attorneys who have formed a defense committee to assist him also protested against prosecution conduct. Ibrahim told one of his attorneys that a State Security officer offered to release him in exchange for naming twenty other activists. Prosecutors have denied defense lawyers access to eleven pages of interrogation transcripts. They have not called witnesses in the case, or lodged formal charges against Ibrahim. State Security officers raided his home at 3 a.m. on April 17, while Ibrahim was in another city. Attorneys in the case say that the warrant from State Security prosecutors authorizing the search is dated eleven hours later. Human rights activists spoke to Ibrahim in hiding on the day following the State Security raid. “I have nothing to conceal,” Ibrahim said, expressing outrage at security forces’ assault on his privacy, which he believes is in retaliation for his political activism.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

The 17-page report, """"Climate of Fear: Sexual Violence and Abduction of Women and Girls in Baghdad,"""" concludes that the failure of Iraqi and U.S.-led occupation authorities to provide public security in Iraq's capital lies at the root of a widespread fear of rape and abduction among women and their families. """"Women and girls today in Baghdad are scared, and many are not going to schools or jobs or looking for work,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"If Iraqi women are to participate in postwar society, their physical security needs to be an urgent priority."""" Human Rights Watch interviewed rape and abduction victims and witnesses, Iraqi police and health professionals, and U.S. military police and civil affairs officers, and learned of twenty-five credible allegations of rape or abduction. The Human Rights Watch report found that police officers gave low priority to allegations of sexual violence and abduction, that the police were under-resourced, and that victims of sexual violence confronted indifference and sexism from Iraqi law enforcement personnel. The report also found that U.S. military police were not filling the gap when Iraqi police were unwilling or unable to conduct serious investigations of sexual violence and abduction. Human Rights Watch said this inadequate attention to the needs of women and girls has led to an inability, and in some cases an unwillingness, by police to conduct serious investigations. In some cases, reports of sexual violence and abduction to police were lost. Megally urged that Iraqi and occupation authorities urgently undertake legal reforms, law enforcement training, and health and support services for women. The U.S. should deploy a special investigative unit to investigate sex-based and trafficking crimes against women and girls, until such time as the Iraqi police can take up the responsibility for it. Cases documented in the report include: Saba A. (not her real name), a nine-year-old girl, was brutally raped by a man who grabbed her from the stairs of the residence hotel where she lives, in the middle of the afternoon on May 22. A hospital refused to treat her, and the forensic institute refused to give her an exam because she did not have an official referral. Muna B.(not her real name), a fifteen-year-old-girl, escaped from a house outside Baghdad on June 8, where she had been held for a month with her two sisters and seven other children. She wasn't raped, but her sister was, and she thought that her captors intended to sell her and the other children to traffickers. Her case was reported to U.S. military police, but Iraqi police didn't even take a statement from her. Dalal S. (not her real name), a 23-year-old-woman, was snatched while walking down the street with her mother and other family members on May 15; she was taken to a house outside Baghdad, held overnight and raped. Her father reported her abduction to the police, but they never pursued the allegations. """"Iraqi and U.S. military police continue to receive reports of abductions of women but mechanisms are wholly inadequate for processing these cases,"""" Megally said. For example, on June 17, two young women reported to the U.S. military and Iraqi police that their friend had just been kidnapped. U.S. military police went to the scene of the abduction, but the perpetrators had long-since fled. Iraqi police failed to take a statement from the witnesses and thus no investigation was opened into the abduction of that young woman.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

In a separate incident, a Russian soldier shot and wounded a sixteen-year-old boy in the leg. “In Ingushetia, Russian forces are showing the same patterns of brutal behavior that we’ve seen in Chechnya,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “The Russian government must rein them in or risk spreading insecurity to Ingushetia.” In June 2003, Russian forces based in Chechnya and the forces of the pro-Moscow Chechen administration conducted a series of sweep operations in Ingush villages and in “spontaneous settlements”—abandoned factories or collective farms where displaced Chechens reside. The operations repeated the same patterns of abuse committed during sweeps in Chechnya. In one recent incident, at approximately 4 a.m. on June 3, 2003, armored personnel carriers (APCs), which are used only by Russian forces, and other military vehicles encircled the “OOO URS” settlement of Chechen internally displaced persons (IDPs) in Nazran. According to several witnesses, dozens of armed men in camouflage uniforms, many of them masked, broke into peoples’ homes, forced all the men outside and put them face down on the ground. Over the next several hours, the armed men took pictures of the Chechen men and conducted unsanctioned searches of the IDPs’ shelters. After the armed men left, the settlement dwellers learned that four people had been taken away. Three of them were released the next day, but one was held for sixteen days. This man, who requested anonymity, told Human Rights Watch that he was kept in solitary confinement in an unknown location in Grozny and was never informed of the grounds for his arrest. Until recently, Ingushetia remained a relatively safe and peaceful area, hosting thousands of IDPs who had fled Chechnya after the outbreak of the second conflict in 1999. The situation changed in 2002 when federal migration authorities started pressuring internally displaced persons living in Ingushetia to return to Chechnya, claiming the situation there had “normalized.” This campaign intensified in December 2002, when the authorities attempted to close tent camps and to force their dwellers back, threatening them with arrests on false charges and impending sweep operations in Ingushetia. An international diplomatic and media outcry, coupled with logistical difficulties, ultimately saved the camps from closure, yet the authorities did not abandon the plan and now appear to have again intensified pressure and threats. The recent incidents of violence and abuse have had a chilling effect on Chechen IDPs living in Ingushetia. Many witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch believe that Russian authorities have consciously resorted to what they see as the most effective way of forcing them back to Chechnya—making Ingushetia an equally unsafe place. Chechen displaced persons are not the only victims of the escalating violence. On June 10, three Ingush civilians—sixty-five-year-old Tamara Zabieva and two of her sons, Ali and Umar Zabiev—were returning from their potato field near the village of Galashki, when their truck came under heavy machinegun fire, injuring Zabieva in the back, neck, and head. The brothers took their mother out of the car and Umar stayed with her while Ali ran to the village for help. Local Ingush police who arrived about an hour later found Zabieva unconscious and sent her to the local hospital, but were unable to find Umar. His body, bearing clear marks of torture and gun shot wounds, was discovered the next morning in a nearby forest. The Ingush police said that evidence suggests involvement by federal servicemen, but the military procuracy has refused to take over the case. While Galashki has in the past been the scene of clashes between Russian federal forces and Chechen rebel fighters, Human Rights Watch has no indication that any such activity took place in the area that day. In a separate incident near the same village on June 4, sixteen-year-old Imran Guliev was sitting on a riverbank with three friends, when a column of APCs drove by and a soldier sitting on top of one of the vehicles shot at the boys, wounding Imran in the leg. The military procuracy has to date refused to open an investigation into the incident, despite several witness testimonies describing the soldier and indicating the number of the APC involved. “Russian authorities have the right and responsibility to counter rebel activity in Ingushetia,” said Andersen. “But these operations have to conform with Russian and international law, including the prohibition against targeting civilians.” Meanwhile, over the last months Chechnya has hardly become safer. Despite the Russian government’s claims of normalization, the conflict is not winding down, and both sides continue to commit serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law. Chechen rebels regularly resort to violence against civilians both in and outside Chechnya, as was demonstrated again by a recent suicide bombing at a music festival in Moscow, reportedly carried out by two Chechen women. Russian forces in Chechnya also continue to commit serious violations with impunity. The dire human rights situation in Chechnya recently prompted the Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) to issue a rare public statement on Chechnya. Following a recent visit to Chechnya, the CPT came to the conclusion that law enforcement agencies and federal forces operating in Chechnya continued to be responsible for torture, ill-treatment, and forced disappearances, and that Russian authorities had taken inadequate action to bring to justice those responsible. “As long as Chechnya remains unsafe, it is the Russian government’s responsibility to provide protection and assistance to those displaced by the conflict,” said Andersen. “It should ensure that they do not face yet another cycle of violence and abuse in Ingushetia.”","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/15/uganda-sharp-decline-human-rights","Uganda- Sharp Decline in Human Rights","Uganda: Sharp Decline in Human Rights","","07/15/2003","Abductions, torture, recruitment of child soldiers, and other abuses have sharply increased in the past year in northern Uganda due to renewed fighting between Ugandan government forces and rebels, a coalition of national and international organizations said in a report released today. The 73-page report, """"Abducted and Abused: Renewed War in Northern Uganda,"""" details how a slew of human rights abuses have resulted in a humanitarian crisis. Since June 2002, the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has abducted nearly 8,400 children and thousands more adults, a sharp rise from 2001. The LRA has also escalated the seventeen-year war against northern Uganda's civilians by targeting religious leaders, aid providers, and those living in internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. """"Child abduction, murder, and mutilation are the signatures of the LRA in this war,"""" said Lloyd Axworthy, former Canadian minister for external affairs. """"This is a war that has been fought primarily against the children and people of northern Uganda."""" Axworthy is CEO and executive director of the Liu Institute for Global Issues in Vancouver, which issued the report together with the Peace and Human Rights Center in Kampala, Human Rights Focus in Gulu, and Human Rights Watch in New York, of which Axworthy is a board member. The seventeen-year conflict between the LRA and the Ugandan government intensified in March 2002, when the government army, the Ugandan People's Defence Forces (UPDF), launched a military offensive, """"Operation Iron Fist,"""" against LRA bases in southern Sudan. The offensive failed to accomplish its aim of destroying the LRA, which evaded the UPDF and in June 2002 returned to northern Uganda. The renewed conflict is taking its highest toll ever: Since June 2002, the LRA abducted 8,400 children, the highest rate of abductions ever in seventeen years of war. Fear of LRA abduction has driven approximately 20,000 children to escape nightly into Gulu and other towns. These children sleep on verandas, on church grounds and at local hospitals, returning home each morning, becoming locally known as """"night commuters."""" An estimated 800,000 northern Ugandans are internally displaced due to LRA attacks and government orders-approximately 70 percent of the entire population of the three war-affected districts in northern Uganda. Respective Mortality Rate (for three months in 2003) for children under five in two IDP camps near Gulu was 5.67/1,000, where 4/1,000 is considered an emergency. This rate was the highest recorded in five years, yet it was not caused by any outbreak of disease, leading the agency conducting the survey to raise the possibility that the children had simply """"died of hunger."""" Although overall HIV prevalence in Uganda has reportedly declined substantially in recent years, there is lingering high prevalence in the north: Gulu reportedly has the second highest rate of HIV prevalence after Kampala, attributed among other things to the higher rate of HIV among combatants. Among expectant mothers tested at one of two hospitals in Gulu, the rates of HIV prevalence were 11-12 percent, where 5 percent is the national rate.  The report draws on interviews with recently abducted children who escaped from the LRA. It gives voice to internally displaced persons living in the IDP camps that have been attacked by the LRA, and the aid workers attempting to reach these victims despite frequent LRA ambushes on relief convoys. While the Ugandan government is obligated to intervene to stop these violations, its own forces have committed gross abuses, including torture, rape, underage recruitment, and arbitrary detention. The government has also increased the suffering of northern Uganda's population through the forced displacement of civilians into IDP camps, which have little or no protection. But UPDF soldiers and other government forces accused by civilians of serious crimes such as murder, torture, or rape often escape trial or sanction, creating the public perception of impunity. """"Not only has the Ugandan government failed to protect its citizens adequately,"""" said Samuel B. Tindifa, director of the Human Rights and Peace Centre. """"They have also actively violated their rights, detained them for long periods without showing cause, and recruited children into the army and home guards."""" The UPDF in northern Uganda arrests civilians on suspicion of rebel collaboration with little or no evidence, often holding them for rough interrogation or torture before turning them over to the police for prosecution. The prosecutors then charge the suspects with treason or terrorism, which allows the government to hold them for up to 360 days without bail and without having to present any evidence. """"The United Nations and members of the international community need to take a more active role to end this desperate state of affairs in northern Uganda,"""" said Jemera Rone, counsel for the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government and LRA peace talks have ended and the war is continuing at a heightened pace, with worse impact than ever on the entire population of Acholiland."""" The organizations urged the U.N. Secretary-General to appoint a special representative for northern Uganda to secure the release of abducted children by conducting """"shuttle diplomacy"""" between the LRA and the Ugandan government. They also called upon the Sudanese government to end its support of the LRA and upon donor countries to monitor military assistance to Uganda to ensure that the government observes human rights standards. The four organizations called on the LRA to end its attacks on civilians, to stop abducting children and adults, and to release the abductees. The organizations also urged the government of Uganda to: End impunity for human rights violations by government security and armed forces; Review all cases of treason and terrorism suspects to ensure that sufficient evidence exists to justify detention; Cease using treason or terrorism charges as a holding charge for those arbitrarily detained in areas in which rebels are active; Take effective measures to protect civilians; and Permit those living in internally displaced persons camps to move wherever they wish, except for extreme circumstances of insecurity.","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights, Joseph Kony - Lord's Resistance Army"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/15/tibetans-lost-chinese-legal-system","Tibetans Lost in Chinese Legal System","Tibetans Lost in Chinese Legal System","Activist Released, But Others Still Held","07/15/2003","(New York) -- The recent release of a Tibetan activist is welcome, but Chinese authorities should stop secret trials of other Tibetans, Human Rights Watch said today. Tserang Dondrup was released on July 11 after a year in custody, but little is known about the conditions of his detention or release. Human Rights Watch said that China's failure to acknowledge long prison sentences against Tibetans demonstrates yet again the government's determination to prevent the international community from learning the full extent of its ongoing crackdown against Tibetan activists. """"Tibetans continue to fall into the black hole of the Chinese legal system,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Secret trials and secret sentences make a mockery of China's pretense that its legal system acts according to the rule of law."""" It is believed that Tashi Phuntsog, a follower of activist monk Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, is still in prison, sentenced to a seven-year year prison term. He reportedly was secretly tried in the Kardze (Ganzi in Chinese) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP) in Sichuan province. For Tibetans in detention, little is known about the charges against them, where they are held, the length of their sentences, the conditions of their confinement, or their health. Even after Tserang Dondrup's reported release, there was no official confirmation of the charges against him or Tashi Phuntsog. No reference to either of the men has appeared in official public documents or the Chinese media since their arrests in 2002. However, credible unofficial accounts reported their secret trials and sentences. Both men are believed to be in poor health. According to local reports, at his release, Tsering Dondrup could not see or walk, and """"his hands were not working."""" Although he is trying to make himself understood, his speech is unintelligible. It is unclear if the damage to his health is life-threatening. In highly publicized trials late last year, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche and Lobsang Dondrup were convicted for involvement in a series of five explosions in Sichuan province. Tenzin Delek was sentenced to death in December 2002; his sentence has been suspended for two years. Lobsang Dondrup was executed on January 26, 2003. Officials have never explained Tenzin Delek's alleged role in the incidents or provided evidence of either man's guilt. The arrests of Tashi Phuntsog and Tserang Dondrup were part of a sweep against Tibetans associated with Tenzin Delek. Human Rights Watch has learned that at least thirteen men sympathetic to Tenzin Delek were detained between the time he was arrested in April 2002 and February 2003. China has not acknowledged these arrests. Four others, fearful of arrest because they worked or studied with Tenzin Delek, have gone into hiding. """"China must publicly acknowledge the fate of all Tibetans held,"""" said Adams. """"Beijing's failure to operate openly and its history of repression against Tibetan activists create legitimate cause for concern about the fairness of their trials and their conditions of detention."""" Background on Tashi Phuntsog and Tserang Dondrup Tashi Phuntsog, in his early forties, was a senior monk at Kham Nalendra Thegchen Jangchub Choeling and a close associate of Tenzin Delek. He was hospitalized with tuberculosis at the time of his arrest on April 17, 2002, ten days after Tenzin Delek was seized. He reportedly is serving a seven-year sentence. There are unconfirmed reports that he was tried in April 2003, one year after his arrest, for """"supporting"""" Tenzin Delek and that he is held in a prison in Dartsedo (Kangding in Chinese) county. According to one local report, six days after he was detained, security personnel took Tashi Phuntsog in handcuffs back to his monastery. During that visit, the officers reportedly videotaped a staged version of his arrest. Monks who knew Tashi Phuntsog report that he was Tenzin Delek's """"right hand man."""" In addition to helping with the work of building monasteries, orphanages, schools, and homes for the elderly, he worked closely with Tenzin Delek on issues related to environmental degradation, such as extensive illegal logging and mining. Tenzin Delek had tried to stop or limit such activities in his home area. Tashi Phuntsog was involved in collecting approximately 40,000 signatures defending Tenzin Delek and his work. The petition was delivered to Chinese authorities in early 2001. According to local reports, Tserang Dondrup (also known as Jortse), formerly a Chinese Communist Party member and a village head in Ortok, Horlong township, is serving a five-year sentence. He is in his late sixties or early seventies. He was one of the principal organizers of the local petition drive in 2000 to defend Tenzin Delek and an active supporter of Tenzin Delek's educational, religious, and environmental efforts in Lithang and Nyagchuka counties. He reportedly was accused at trial of """"cheating the people"""" and """"misguiding them"""" into supporting Tenzin Delek. Dondrup was tried sometime between June and November 2002, probably in Nyagchuka county. It is known that he was initially held in the local detention center, but an attempt to transfer him to a prison in the network of prisons known as Rangakha in Kardze TAP failed when the prison refused to accept him because of his medical condition and his age. According to one account, Tserang Dondrup was arrested in June 2002. When he exited his house to greet a senior official, he was immediately seized by armed police. When his wife and grandson tried to stop the arrest, the police responded with force, knocking both of them to the ground. The house was ransacked and a portrait of the Dalai Lama was smashed. When police searched Tserang Dondrup's house, they removed photographs he took in Chengdu and Beijing of the group that submitted the petition to central government officials. Several days after the incident, at a public meeting in Ortok, officials stripped Tserang Dondrup of his Communist Party membership and warned other party members not to emulate him. Human Rights Watch believes that since 2002 at least thirteen other Tibetans were detained for peaceful political activities protected by international law. Three, all senior monks, served one-year administrative reeducation through labor sentences for engaging in activities inciting """"splittism"""" (Tibetan independence). Others were detained for periods ranging from days to weeks for attempting to circulate news and details of the arrests, court proceedings, and treatment of those arrested or about who had been detained and where they had been taken. Others appear to have been seized simply because of their long association with Tenzin Delek. Tibetan cases officially acknowledged by China: Tenzin Delek Rinpoche: arrested at Jamyang Choekhorling monastery, Nyagchuka, Sichuan province on April 7, 2002; accused of """"incitement to separatism"""" and """"crimes of terror""""; sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve. The usual practice in China is that if the prisoner behaves well, at the end of the two-year period such a sentence is commuted to a life term. Lobsang Dondrup, twenty-eight; arrested in Chengdu; accused of distributing pro-independence leaflets and planting five bombs; executed January 26, 2003. Cases not acknowledged, still in custody: Tashi Phuntsog, in his early forties; monk at Jamyang Choekhorling monastery; Nyagchuka; arrested approximately April 21, 2002; hospitalized for tuberculosis at the time; believed serving a seven-year term.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/15/letter-president-lagos-judicial-investigations-chile","Letter to President Lagos on Judicial Investigations in Chile","Letter to President Lagos on Judicial Investigations in Chile","","07/15/2003","President Ricardo Lagos Escobar President of the Republic of Chile Palacio de la Moneda Santiago Chile   Dear Mr. President,   I write in regard to the measures your government is currently considering to expedite judicial investigations into the grave human rights violations committed under military rule, and to provide further means of reparation and compensation to relatives of the victims.   Although much remains to be done to clarify the fate of victims and to hold accountable those responsible for the abuses, the courts have undoubtedly made considerable advances in recent months. Most of the indictments are the result of investigations conducted by special judges who were appointed after the Mesa de Diálogo and whose focus is human rights cases.   Statements made in January by the commander-in-chief of the army, Gen. Juan Emilio Cheyre, to the effect that human rights violations committed by the armed forces during the military government """"had no justification"""" are helpful. His view that the path to social peace lies in respecting the verdicts of the courts is worth recalling in the context of the current discussions. We also welcome the recent declaration made by eight retired generals who held command positions during the military government acknowledging the responsibility of the armed forces for human rights abuses. We hope that statements like these will encourage those with information on human rights violations to provide it to the courts.   From a legal point of view, advances in court investigations have been possible largely due to the doctrine, now widely adopted by the courts, that """"disappearances"""" must be considered an ongoing crime until the remains of the victim have been found or the circumstances of their death clarified. The courts have thus allowed criminal investigations to continue despite the amnesty law introduced by the military government in 1978. This doctrine is consistent with international standards regarding the investigation and punishment of grave human rights abuses. As the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in the Barrios Altos case in 2001: """"it is unacceptable to use amnesty provisions, statutes of limitation, or measures designed to remove criminal liability, as a means of preventing the investigation and punishment of those responsible for gross violations of human rights such as torture, summary, extra-legal or arbitrary executions, and disappearances.""""   Despite the criticism this doctrine has attracted from some political sectors, Your Excellency's government has rightly abstained from intervening in what is properly an issue for the courts to decide.   There is little prospect that the judicial investigations will soon be completed, due to the enormous difficulties in clarifying the fate of victims and the whereabouts of their bodies. The recovery and identification of remains was prevented in some cases by their exhumation and secret disposal by military personnel years after the victims' presumed execution. As the armed forces revealed in the Mesa de Diálogo, the remains of many were dropped from aircraft into the ocean, making their recovery impossible. The delays and difficulties in ascertaining what happened to these victims have caused great distress to their relatives. There is even less information on the fate of hundreds who """"disappeared"""" at the hands of the DINA, General Pinochet's secret police. Under these circumstances, there can be no question but that judicial investigations must continue, and every possible effort must be made to expedite them and make them more effective.   First, the courts must investigate the circumstances of the secret removal of bodies and hold accountable those responsible for covering up evidence of grave human rights abuses. We welcome the recent indictment of five former soldiers for the illegal exhumation in 1978 of the bodies of victims killed in September 1973 and buried in Fuerte Arteaga. Valuable information may be obtained in these investigations that throws light on how victims were killed and what happened to their bodies afterwards.   We support legislation to allow the courts to consider the cooperation of military personnel in providing valuable information on """"disappearances"""" or the disposal of bodies as a mitigating circumstance when fixing penalties. Those who refuse to cooperate in providing information should receive stiffer sentences. Measures to this effect would provide an incentive for those charged with lesser crimes to cooperate and assist the investigations   Second, any time limits on judicial investigations should be strictly avoided. In its proposal on human rights submitted to Your Excellency on June 20, the Unión Democrática Independiente (UDI) has suggested that court investigations be conducted within a fixed period, after which the judge would determine whether the victim was still alive and held captive, or must be presumed to be dead. We believe that setting a time limit on the invesigations may lead to cases being closed prematurely, before the investigations have found evidence to determine the death of the victim or the identity of those responsible. Moreover, this proposal could have the effect of encouraging those who have information to remain silent, in the knowledge that on expiry of the time limit they would be beyond reach of the law.   Third, judges should base their findings on the fate of victims on evidence pertinent to the case in hand, not on a """"conviction"""" based in part on extrapolation from other cases, as the UDI proposal suggests. Cases should in no circumstances be closed on the strength of a presumption. If conclusive evidence of death is lacking, and/or the identity of those responsible unclear, the investigation should remain open. .   We believe that the Medical-Legal Service (SML) should be provided additional resources to carry out its forensic work to identify remains and determine the cause of death. The performance of the SML and its needs should be carefully monitored. We also strongly support continuing the mandate of the special judges dedicated exclusively or preferentially to human rights cases..   In regard to provisions for reparation and compensation for the relatives of victims of human rights violations, we were extremely encouraged to learn that your government is giving serious consideration to establishing a commission to investigate cases of torture under the military government and draw up a list of victims who would receive special benefits in compensation for their suffering. The establishment of such a commission, which has long been advocated by the Ethical Commission Against Torture, would be an important breakthrough. Despite the landmark work done by the Rettig Commission and its successor, the full scope of the phenomenon of torture has never been the subject of an official investigation in Chile. The thousands of individuals who survived torture were not included in their reports, and they have never received compensation from the state. The formation of a commission on torture would also have an important deterrent effect.   In addition to these new initiatives to investigate cases of torture and the possibilities of reparation to torture victims, we believe that your government should review and increase benefits and compensation to the relatives of those who were killed by state forces or by armed groups opposed to the state during the military government.   Finally, we hope that your government will tackle another legacy of military rule: the over-extension of military justice to include crimes committed by civilians as well as non-military crimes committed by military personnel. The competence of military courts should be limited to purely military offenses and civilians should be judged exclusively by civilian courts. Human rights violations committed by military personnel should also be a matter for civilian courts. We welcome the bill to limit the jurisdiction of military courts recently presented by Congressman Juan Bustos and others. We urge Your Excellency to treat the reform of military justice as a priority human rights issue in the government's legislative program.   Thank you for your attention to these important matters.

Because they lobby so hard against them.   The U.S. attempted to weaken language prohibiting the juvenile death penalty in a resolution on children's rights earlier this year's session of the Commission, but Human Rights Watch successfully pressed other governments to resist this effort.   Human Rights Watch also successfully pressed for stronger language condemning the execution of juvenile offenders in the death penalty resolution approved at this year's session of the Commission. The resolution calls on those states that retain the death penalty not to impose it on persons below the age of 18.   Unlike past years, the resolution does not couch this demand in terms of the treaties that states have ratified, notably the Convention on the Rights of the Child (to which the United States is not a party). This is a further affirmation that the execution of juvenile offenders is absolutely prohibited under international law and is yet another indication of the overwhelming international concensus against the execution of juvenile offenders.

The court system is expected to try former members of the Iraqi government and others accused of crimes against humanity and genocide. The Iraqi judiciary, weakened and compromised by decades of Ba'ath party rule, lacks the capacity, experience, and independence to provide fair trials for the abuses of the past, Human Rights Watch said. Few judges in Iraq, including those who fled into exile, have participated in trials of the complexity that they would face when prosecuting leadership figures for acts of genocide, crimes against humanity, or war crimes. Local courts will be needed to try many cases related to past human rights crimes, Human Rights Watch said, but the complexity of the trials of the most senior officials will require a strong international role. """"Justice for the crimes of the past is indeed a top priority,"""" said Hania Mufti, Human Rights Watch's representative in Iraq. """"It is important and not too late to bring the international community on board to help in the process of justice and accountability in Iraq."""" On Tuesday, the recently established Iraqi Governing Council announced the establishment of a judicial commission that will set up a special court system to investigate and prosecute former members of the government of Saddam Hussein and others who were involved in genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. The urgency with which the Governing Council has addressed the issue of justice contrasts sharply with the negligible attention shown by the U.S.-led coalition forces to justice in Iraq, Human Rights Watch said. The U.S.-led occupation administration in Baghdad still has not announced a strategy for justice in Iraq, even though major combat operations ended more than two months ago. Coalition forces have also provided almost no assistance with the exhumation of the mass graves scattered all over Iraq, losing crucial evidence of crimes against humanity and genocide. Bringing about accountability for the crimes of the past two decades in Iraq will be a massive undertaking for the Iraqi people, Human Rights Watch said. Among the crimes to be investigated and prosecuted are the genocidal Anfal campaign against the Iraqi Kurds, which resulted in the deaths of some 100,000 civilians and the destruction of more than 4,000 villages; the use of chemical weapons against Iranian troops and Kurdish civilians; the """"disappearance"""" and executions of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis; the large-scale killings that followed the failed 1991 uprisings in the north and south of Iraq; the destruction and repression of the Marsh Arabs; and the forced expulsion of ethnic minorities in Northern Iraq during the """"Arabization"""" campaign. International assistance in the form of investigators, prosecutors, and judges will be required to support the efforts of the Iraqi people to bring about justice for the crimes of the past, to assure the impartiality and credibility of the process, and to guarantee that international fair trial standards are adhered to. Accountability for the past in Iraq could best be advanced by the creation of an international or an Iraqi-international commission of experts to assist with gathering and preservation of evidence and recommendations of the most appropriate court proceedings. Human Rights Watch has recommended the creation of either an international tribunal or an international-national tribunal for Iraq, incorporating existing, uncompromised elements of the Iraqi judiciary with international colleagues.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

In the United States, by contrast, the announcement barely registered as a blip on the radar screen. And yet Blair seems reluctant, even now, to challenge his hosts forcefully on an issue where international law is simply being trampled - at the expense of British citizens. In the circumstances, it will be extraordinary if Blair fails to speak out strongly on this issue. Blair's role is especially important because of the widespread indifference on this subject in the United States. The announcement last week that six terrorist suspects are eligible for trial by military commissions may have seemed a bombshell in Britain, not least because two of the six are British citizens. In the United States, by contrast, the announcement barely registered as a blip on the radar screen. For the United States, those detained at Guantanamo Bay are faceless foreigners labeled by the Bush administration as the """"worst of the worst"""" terrorists. There is little recognition that these are real people with real families who - whatever crimes they may have committed - deserve due process. In these circumstances, it becomes doubly important for Britain to speak out. British officials continue to talk of their """"concerns"""" about the proposed commissions. But much more is needed. George Bush must hear from the one person he and his administration really care about: Tony Blair. From the perspective of Washington, it is not Britain which represents America's strongest ally in the global war on terror - it is the Prime Minister himself. The mutterings that we have heard from Downing Street and other ministers in recent days are insufficient. The recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal must be as blunt and outspoken as his hosts in the Bush administration are often ready to be. Serious questions persist about the legality of the commissions under international law. Placing persons deserving prisoner-of-war status before a military commission rather than a court martial would constitute a war crime. Asserting military jurisdiction over those apprehended far from any battlefield places civilian courts everywhere at risk. In 2002 the Bush administration addressed some of the concerns about the military commissions by adding previously disregarded due process protections. These include a presumption of innocence, ostensibly public hearings and a right of defendants to cross-examine witnesses. However, due process protections have little meaning unless the procedures in their entirety protect a defendant's basics rights. The Pentagon rules for the military commission rules fail miserably in this regard. Indeed, the commission rules seem designed to guarantee an unfair trial. They address the legitimate need to protect national security information, including clearance procedures for civilian defence counsel and restrictions to protect classified material. But private defence counsel, even if they succeed in jumping through the necessary security hoops, may still be barred from closed hearings. All defendants must accept a military-appointed defence counsel as lead counsel. And - as the British solicitors for the two designated Britons recently learned - non-American lawyers need not apply. Those problems are only the beginning. The rules permit the monitoring of all communications between defence lawyers and defendants """"for security and intelligence purposes,"""" shattering the fundamental principle of attorney-client confidentiality. Defence lawyers are not allowed to discuss or share documents about the case with anyone outside of the defence team. And the Pentagon recently amended provisions that would have effectively required defence lawyers to perform all legal research at the site of the trial (presumably Guantanamo Bay). Little wonder that the U.S. government has threatened to move the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, charged with conspiracy in connection with September 11, from U.S. federal courts to a military commission after he sought to question an alleged co-conspirator. The government also dropped criminal charges against Ali Saleh al-Marri, detained since December 2001, and labeled him an """"enemy combatant,"""" thus making him possibly eligible for trial by the military commissions. So it was no surprise that the National Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers announced that the """"rules regulating counsel's behaviour are just too restrictive to give us any confidence that counsel will be able to act zealously and professionally."""" But even the Air Force colonel named as chief defence counsel has expressed concern about the rules. Perhaps most disturbing is the absence of any independent judicial review of the verdicts. Any review will be by the executive branch, effectively making the Bush administration the prosecutor, judge, jury and, because of the death penalty, possible executioner. To be on the safe side, the military rules contain a gag order that prohibits defence lawyers from ever speaking publicly about the cases, even to raise due process issues unrelated to security concerns. And as the administration has noted, an acquittal will not necessarily mean that the defendant will be released from detention. In the end, few terrorist cases are likely to proceed to full trials. The lopsided rules plus the threat of capital punishment will compel defendants to accept plea agreements, even if harsh. This will permit prosecutors to declare victory, but the broader public will be deprived an important opportunity to assess guilt or innocence. Americans and others will still know little about who is being held at Guantanamo Bay and why. The fundamental rights of those accused, including the two Britons, are at stake. But so too is the broader commitment of democratic governments to justice and the rule of law in the war on terror. The anger in the British parliament has focused so far on the need to bring British citizens home, to face trial in the UK. That demand is understandable, in one respect. But the lack of due process is important for all those who are held at Guantanamo, not just the British. For British and other nationalities alike, the key issue is not where the trials take place but how they take place. International law must be restored. Until now, Downing Street has seemed eager to blunt the edge of its own criticisms, with """"on the one hand... on the other hand"""" phrases, which imply that the lack of due process in the military commissions is somehow made less serious because of the gravity of the alleged crimes. In reality, it is in the case of serious crimes, above all, that due process matters more than ever. A mealy-mouthed approach by Tony Blair in the days to come will help nobody. On the contrary. A failure to speak out strongly will be dangerous for all.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, United Kingdom","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo"

A series of amnesties following the forced resignation of President Suharto in May 1998 led to the release of all prisoners of conscience and pledges by the Indonesian authorities to end politically motivated prosecutions. However, since then at least 46 prisoners of conscience have been imprisoned--39 of them since Megawati Sukarnoputri became president in July 2001. """"Moves towards greater political freedoms and respect for freedom of expression are being undermined by the prosecution and imprisonment of peaceful political, labor, independence and other activists,"""" said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch's Asia division director. """"With less than one year to go before Indonesia's first direct presidential elections, to be locking up individuals who criticize the government is an alarming development for the electoral process."""" The two human rights organizations expressed particular concern about the increasing use of an article under Indonesia's Criminal Code that punishes """"insulting the President or Vice-President"""" with up to six years imprisonment. Since late 2002, at least 14 political activists have been sentenced to prison terms and three others are facing charges under these provisions. In most cases, the activists have been arrested following their participation in peaceful demonstrations. """"Repressive legislation used under the authoritarian regime of former President Suharto has no place in a country which claims to be set on a path towards a fully-fledged democracy,"""" said Ingrid Massage, interim director of the Asia and Pacific Program of Amnesty International. Ignatius Mahendra, the Chairman of the Yogyakarta branch of the National Democratic Student's League (LMND), and Yoyok Eko Widodo, a member of the Street Buskers Union (SPI), are among the latest to be imprisoned under charges of insulting the President or Vice-President. Each was sentenced to three years in prison in April after being found guilty of burning portraits of President Megawati Sukarnoputri and Vice-President Hamzah Haz during a peaceful demonstration in January this year. On July 1, a five-year prison term was handed down to Muhammad Nazar, a leading political activist in Aceh province on Sumatra. He was accused of """"spreading hatred against the government"""" for his participation in peaceful pro-independence meetings earlier this year. A range of other repressive legislation has also been used to detain prisoners of conscience. Peaceful independence activists in the provinces of Aceh and Papua have been charged with """"spreading hatred against the government"""" or with rebellion. Four trade union activists who were arrested in East Kalimantan in January 2002 for their role in peaceful protests against wage levels are currently appealing prison sentences of up to six months after being found guilty of inciting the public to commit a criminal act. Both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have campaigned for many years for the amendment of the Indonesian Criminal Code to conform with international law in order to protect basic freedoms of expression and assembly. """"The repeal of these laws is long overdue,"""" said Ingrid Massage of Amnesty International. """"Any legal provisions that criminalize peaceful political activities must be repealed as soon as possible. In the meantime, the Megawati administration should make a public commitment to end any such prosecutions, which call into question its commitment to a pluralistic society based on respect for human rights."""" The two human rights organizations also called upon donors, including Japan, the European Union, the United States and Australia, to insist on legal reforms to end these retrograde practices that are creating a new generation of political prisoners in Indonesia. The problem of unfair trials in which prisoners of conscience have been convicted must also be addressed. In many cases, arrests have been carried out without warrants and detainees have been denied access to lawyers, and in some cases, subjected to torture and other ill-treatment.","Asia, Indonesia",""

President Obasanjo should also make an explicit commitment not to shield Liberian President Charles Taylor from justice. Over the last two weeks in Nigeria, several people have been shot dead by the police and others severely beaten, Human Rights Watch said. The incidents form part of a broader pattern of increased harassment and intimidation of critics of the Nigerian government. """"Bush is coming to Nigeria at a critical moment, and he can't ignore this violence,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The improvements in civil liberties since the advent of civilian rule in Nigeria are now being reversed."""" Human Rights Watch also urged President Obasanjo to ensure that his recent offer of a """"safe haven"""" for Charles Taylor does not effectively protect the Liberian president from prosecution. Despite championing the notions of human rights and justice in international fora, President Obasanjo appears ready to allow the Liberian president to evade justice. """"There is an international indictment against Charles Taylor for war crimes and crimes against humanity,"""" said Takirambudde. """"By letting him off the hook, President Obasanjo would be signaling his complete disregard for the principle of justice - a stand which, unfortunately, tends to mirror the situation within Nigeria itself."""" A sharp increase in the price of fuel sparked a general strike and widespread protests in Nigeria from June 30 to July 8. Police used teargas and live shots to disperse protesters. While there were reports that some protestors had resorted to violence, many protests were completely peaceful. On July 3, about thirty people were reportedly arrested in Abuja after delivering a petition to the U.S. embassy, protesting President Bush's visit to Nigeria on the grounds that it conferred legitimacy on President Obasanjo's government. Five days later, they remained in detention without charge, in an undisclosed location. Some of the detainees were brought to the national police headquarters where they told colleagues that the police accused them of embarrassing the Nigerian government. They also claimed that the police had subjected them to intense pressure to """"confess"""" that their protest to the U.S. embassy had been sponsored by the presidential candidate of Nigeria's main opposition party, the All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP). On July 7, at least six people, and possibly several more, were shot dead by the police in Lagos. Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that in several parts of the city, the police opened fire on the crowds indiscriminately. For example, in Yaba, a young man in his twenties was shot dead as he stood outside his house. Witnesses described the police action in Yaba as completely unprovoked and said the protests had been peaceful until the police started dispersing the crowds. In Akowonjo, at least three people were reported to have died and several more injured as a result of police shootings. The police have denied any knowledge of the shootings in Lagos. In the southern city of Port Harcourt, three people including two secondary school students were shot dead on July 2 as police dispersed a student protest on the Port Harcourt-Aba express road. Several students were also beaten by police and arrested in a separate student protest on the Ikwerre Road the same day. In Abuja on July 1, a group of more than ten policemen assaulted an Associated Press photographer who was taking photographs of a protest rally. They beat him severely with whips and rifle-butts, kicked him, and smashed his cameras. The policemen said that they were beating him because of the pictures he and other journalists were taking. Two reporters working for the Vanguard newspaper were also beaten the same day. At least two journalists, including one of the Vanguard reporters, were also arrested. They were released later the same day. """"President Bush cannot pretend it is business as usual in Nigeria when people have been brutalized by the police only days before his visit,"""" said Takirambudde. The Nigerian government should issue clear instructions to the police to allow peaceful protests and to refrain from using excessive force against people who are not engaging in violence. It should also release those arrested in connection with the protest at the U.S. embassy, unless there are grounds for charging them with a recognizable criminal offense.","Africa, United States, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/09/liberia-case-intervention","Liberia- A Case for Intervention","Liberia: A Case for Intervention?","Testimony of Janet Fleischman before the U.S. Congressional Human Rights Caucus","07/09/2003","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these important hearings and for inviting me to testify. My name is Janet Fleischman, and I am the Washington Director for Africa of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch has monitored the human rights situation in Liberia and in the West African sub region for more than a decade, through regular missions as well as a field presence for over three years in Sierra Leone. We recently completed a field investigation in Côte d'Ivoire and neighboring countries. Based on our information, we would like to offer the following analysis of the human rights situation in Liberia and recommendations for U.S. policy.   President Bush's current trip to Africa provides an important moment to assess the challenges and opportunities for U.S. policy in Liberia and in the West African sub-region. Developments in the past year in Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire highlight the serious potential for a constant regional cycle of conflict and destabilization as armed groups produce new cycles of human rights abuses, internally displaced persons and refugees, and child soldiers. Protection of civilians and accountability for abuses are two key issues in the region, both of which must be addressed through political and financial efforts.   While the Special Court for Sierra Leone represents an important attempt to end the cycle of violence and impunity by holding accountable those who bear the greatest responsibility for gross abuses of human rights, more efforts are needed to investigate and document the ways in which human rights abuses continue to fuel conflicts throughout the region, and to hold perpetrators accountable. In particular, the indictment of President Charles Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone should be built upon to ensure accountability for all those responsible for war crimes and other serious violations of human rights in Liberia.   The United States has a critical role to play in consistently condemning all perpetrators of human rights abuses, whether they are state or non-state actors; limiting their ability to carry out abuses by cutting off supplies of weapons and financing; and supporting effective mechanisms to increase the accountability of regional and local authorities to their populations.  The Human Rights Situation in Liberia   Over the past few months, Liberia has returned to full-scale armed conflict. The main rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), operates from bases in Lofa county in Liberia and from Guinea, where it has that government's support. A second rebel group called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), which has recently split from the LURD and is reportedly receiving support from the Ivorian government, has also made territorial gains and captured Greenville in late April. Many of the members of these rebel groups were part of other warring factions in Liberia's first brutal war. With the support of neighboring governments, they have now re-grouped and re-armed, and have initiated a new phase of war in Liberia.   Both the government of Liberia and Liberian rebel forces are responsible for violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes and other serious human rights abuses. Tens of thousands of Liberians have been forcibly displaced and hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed, either deliberately or in crossfire. Recent human rights abuses committed by both sides include the forced recruitment of children in displaced and refugee camps, forced labor, assault, and sexual violence against civilians, as well as attacks on humanitarian workers. The inflow of arms in breach of the U.N. embargo (see below) contributes to such abuses. The Liberian government has continued its intolerance of dissent, and civil society actors - especially human rights activists and independent journalists -- face harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment.   Fighting between the Liberian government and rebel groups spread to all three neighboring borders in 2003. As of March 2003, incidents at Bo Waterside, on the Sierra Leonean border, Ganta on the Guinean border, and Toe town and Zwedru, near the Ivorian border, reflected the increasing regional involvement in the Liberian war, with attacks taking place both along and across borders. Due to the fighting and the lack of security guarantees for aid workers, parts of the country have been inaccessible to humanitarian agencies since the resurgence of fighting in March 2003. Many civilians are in territory under the control of Liberian rebel groups, the LURD and MODEL.   The peace talks being held in Ghana produced a ceasefire agreement on June 17, 2003. The ceasefire has been broken by several serious bouts of fighting between the Liberian government and rebel forces in and around Monrovia. The recent conflict has displaced thousands of civilians and exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in the country. In late June, troops from the LURD entered and then retreated to the outskirts of Monrovia, prompting mass displacement and reports of numerous deaths of civilians in and around the town. According to credible sources in Monrovia, several hundred civilians have died in the capital in the past few weeks from the fighting, from reprisal killings, and from the increasing toll taken by disease. The U.S. is currently considering sending troops to Liberia, and a team of military experts arrived in Monrovia on Monday to assess the humanitarian and security situation. Human Rights Watch believes that the deployment of a peacekeeping force with U.N. authorization to protect civilians would make an important contribution to stabilizing the situation in Liberia and that the U.S. has an important role to play in such a force, given its historical links to the country. We consider it of utmost importance that any military action be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The force should have a robust mandate to ensure the maintenance of law and order, to protect civilians, and help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need.  The Indictment of Charles Taylor   Elected president of Liberia in 1997 after a seven-year war ousted former president Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor gained international notoriety for the brutal abuses of civilians perpetrated by his forces in Liberia, and for his use of child soldiers organized in """"Small Boy Units."""" Taylor's support for the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone contributed to the deaths, rape and mutilations of thousands of civilians, and led to United Nations sanctions on his regime. Taylor's forces have also been implicated in conflicts in neighboring Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire.   On June 4, the Special Court for Sierra Leone """"unsealed"""" its indictment against Charles Taylor as one of those """"bearing the greatest responsibility"""" for war crimes (including murder and taking hostages); crimes against humanity (rape, murder, extermination, sexual slavery); and other serious violations of international humanitarian law (use of child soldiers) committed in Sierra Leone. The indictment charges that Taylor actively supported the RUF in Sierra Leone's ten-year civil war, providing training and helping finance the RUF, in preparation for RUF armed action in Sierra Leone and during the subsequent armed conflict in Sierra Leone. It also alleges that Taylor acted in concert with members of the RUF/Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) rebel alliance who are accused of horrific crimes.   The Special Court was established by agreement between the United Nations and Sierra Leone and is designed to function for three years. The Special Court has power to prosecute those """"who bear the greatest responsibility"""" for serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain violations of Sierra Leone law committed in Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996. The Special Court's Statute and implementing legislation specifically provide that official capacity is no defense to arrest or prosecution, i.e., there is no immunity for a head of state. The statutes for the Rwanda and Yugoslav Tribunals and the International Criminal Court similarly bar immunity based on official position, reflecting the increasing trend by international courts to bring officials to justice for war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law, even while they are still in office.   The future of President Charles Taylor is uncertain. After initially stating that he would step down in favor of a transitional government, he has recently wavered on that point, and now says that he will not leave until U.S. peacekeeping troops have arrived. His past record of broken agreements and commitments give little grounds for hope that he will fulfill the most recent accords, or that providing him immunity would bring stability.   President Bush has explicitly called for Taylor to step down. Meanwhile, President John Kufuor of Ghana has urged that Taylor be given immunity from prosecution in exchange for leaving office, and President Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria has offered him a """"safe haven"""" in Nigeria.   Suggestions of withdrawing the indictment or providing immunity from prosecution to Charles Taylor should be rejected in light of the lessons learned in the region. In 1999, the Lomé peace accord in Sierra Leone purportedly granted an amnesty for crimes committed by all combatants during the civil war on the basis that this was necessary to achieve peace. But once granted amnesty, the rebels resumed military operations, plunging Sierra Leone into two more years of war. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which has a mandate to bring those who bear the greatest responsibilities for atrocities to justice, is one of the key mechanisms that are now contributing to the restoration of peace in that country.   The United States should support Charles Taylor's indictment and state clearly that no safe haven should be provided to Taylor, and that every government should implement the international arrest warrant of the Special Court for Sierra Leone and hand him over to the Court for prosecution. If U.S. troops are sent to Liberia, they should not make any deals that involve a withdrawal of the indictment of President Taylor by the Special Court for Sierra Leone or any explicit or implicit understanding that a government will not implement the Court's warrant. At the same time, the U.S. should support plans for strengthening the ceasefire, stabilizing the country, and commit U.S. resources to rebuild post-war Liberia.  Guinea   Efforts to resolve the Liberian crisis cannot succeed without addressing Liberia's neighbors, who have both suffered from and contributed to the cycle of conflict. Guinea is both the principal regional recipient of large numbers of refugees and a key supporter of the Liberian rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD). While Guinea is clearly in a fragile position - holding elections later this year, with an unstable economy, and with over 100,000 Sierra Leonean, Ivorian and Liberian refugees remaining on its territory - the government has an obligation to respect international human rights and humanitarian norms, and to respect the U.N. arms embargo on Liberia.   The U.S. has an important role to play vis-à-vis Guinea's support for the LURD, because of a recent U.S. army training program for the Guinean military. A battalion of 800 soldiers was trained over a six month period, from May 2002. The training, which had a budget of U.S. $3 million, included a mid-term review, but there were no plans to set up mechanisms to monitor the conduct of the troops or their respect for human rights after their deployment.   The U.S. has called on """"all parties in the region to cease supporting any group that seeks political change through violence and to respect their neighbor's borders."""" But although the U.S. has expressed concern about the human rights situation in Guinea and states that it has also privately raised issues of refugee protection with the Guinean government, Human Rights Watch is not aware that the U.S. has made any public statements expressing concern about Guinea's role in supporting the LURD or in colluding with human rights abuses against Liberian refugees.   Guinea should be warned by the United States to cease its support to LURD or face the possibility of sanctions. In addition, it is essential that refugees are able to seek refuge in Guinea and that refugee camps retain a truly humanitarian character.  Côte d'Ivoire   The past eight months of armed conflict in Côte d'Ivoire and, in particular, the patterns of human rights abuses in the western part of the country, are a renewed reminder of the need to address the underlying causes of an ever-shifting regional crisis. The eight-month-old war in the Côte d'Ivoire has revealed deep divisions in Ivorian society and produced numerous serious abuses against civilians, some of which amount to war crimes. Western Côte d'Ivoire has been the site of a virtual proxy war by Liberian forces, demonstrating the easy spillover potential of the Liberian conflict. The recent ceasefire in the west, and the formation of the government of reconciliation, are steps in the right direction, but the Ivorian peace process remains extremely fragile. There is an urgent need to reinforce these positive steps with further concrete action, both within Côte d'Ivoire and in neighboring Liberia. Impunity-both past and present, Ivorian and regional-remains a key concern that must be addressed if a stable Côte d'Ivoire is to emerge from the past months of conflict.  Circulation of Arms   The inflow and circulation of arms, particularly small arms and light weapons, in the region has clearly contributed to the increased conflict and abuses against civilians by governments and armed groups. It also has facilitated the formation of new armed groups and the use of ill disciplined fighters and unaccountable mercenaries.   The recent report of the U.N. Panel of Experts on Liberia documented continuing violations of the arms embargo on Liberia and noted that the support of regional governments such as Guinea to Liberian insurgent groups constitutes a violation of the sanctions regime. The Liberian government recently acknowledged importing huge quantities of small arms and light weapons, and the list of imported weapons it provided the Panel closely match those documented to have been illegally delivered from Serbia and Montenegro in six shipments in 2002; the Liberian government did not admit to earlier illicit arms purchases, which have also been documented. The Panel also described numerous suspected actual or attempted arms shipments to Liberia in recent months, including a possible ongoing scheme to export weapons to Liberia on the basis of a Democratic Republic of Congo end-user certificate.   In addition, abusive insurgents throughout West Africa have been able to obtain arms and other military support with apparent ease. The Panel describes Guinea as a supply route for arms to the LURD, as noted, and points out that it has some evidence Côte d'Ivoire is supporting an armed Liberian militia and MODEL. The use of unaccountable mercenaries and untrained civilian militias, including in Côte d'Ivoire, is also troubling, particularly as many of those recruited, including ex-RUF, are known to have an atrocious human rights record. Human Rights Watch urges the United States to consistently condemn all regional governments that violate the sanctions regime on Liberia and/or support abusive forces. The U.S. should also monitor arms flows using its own technology and presence in the region, and report on its observations to the U.N. Panel.  Recommendations   Human Rights Watch urges the United States to:  Call on all parties in Liberia to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, particularly regarding treatment of civilians and other non-combatants, and recruitment of child soldiers, and to hold those members of their forces responsible for abuses accountable.  Call on all parties in the Liberian conflict to respect humanitarian aid workers and guarantee their security and access to civilian populations in need of assistance and protection.  Actively explore and support mechanisms to ensure accountability for abuses committed by all parties to the conflict.  Support the establishment of a peacekeeping force in Liberia and ensure that any military action be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The force should have U.N. authorization to ensure the maintenance of law and order, to protect civilians, and help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need.  In the event that U.S. troops are sent to Liberia, ensure that the U.S. does not make any deals that involve a withdrawal of the indictment of President Charles Taylor or any explicit or implicit understanding that a government will not implement the Special Court for Sierra Leone's arrest warrant.  Call on all states to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone, and to hand over any additional individuals indicted by the Special Court of Sierra Leone who flee into their territories, to assist in their apprehension, and to otherwise cooperate with the Special Court.  Condemn regional governments for their support to abusive insurgent groups and violations of existing sanctions on Liberia, and consider imposing secondary sanctions on regional governments found to be involved in the Liberian war.","Africa, United States, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

But on the continent of Africa, which President Bush is crisscrossing for the first time this week, the U.S. isn't taking the lead. On his trip, President Bush has a chance to decide if the U.S. will play more than a supporting role.   Two major conflagrations currently beset Africa that demand U.S. attention: one in West Africa, that began in Liberia and has spilled over into the Ivory Coast; and one in the vast Democratic Republic of Congo, where some three million people may have died as a result of the five-year civil war. The United States has done little to resolve either conflict, remaining suspicious of U.N. peacekeeping and unwilling to commit its own political and financial resources.    In both cases, the French have taken the lead, sending peacekeepers to Congo's north-eastern Ituri province and to Cote d'Ivoire - a response that may not be sufficient, but that at least recognizes the severity of these crises. The Bush administration is now considering whether it will break this pattern and send U.S. troops to Liberia, or whether it will just support the ECOWAS effort.    Both conflicts genuinely need U.S. involvement. Liberia was settled by ex-American slaves, and the U.S. refusal to intervene in Liberia in 1990 contributed to the country's descent into bloody conflict. The Liberian president, Charles Taylor, was recently indicted by an international tribunal for his role in fomenting civil war in neighboring Sierra Leone. According to Human Rights Watch research, Liberian fighters have been guns for hire in the Ivory Coast, contributing to the slide into conflict of what was once the region's most prosperous country.    During his trip, African leaders will want to know what Washington is going to do about the crisis in West Africa. Two years ago, British troops pacified Sierra Leone after ten years of vicious civil war. What will the Bush team do about Liberia?    US responsibilities     Meanwhile, the U.S. government also has unique responsibilities for the crisis in the Congo. Two countries most involved in the conflict, Rwanda and Uganda, are two of Washington's closest allies on the continent. Both countries invaded Congo and occupied parts of the east. In the region of Ituri, which was occupied by Uganda and where Rwanda has also been involved, ethnic tensions have led to hundreds, if not thousands, of deaths in recent weeks. Rwanda and Uganda have now withdrawn their troops. But a new Human Rights Watch report, released this week, documents how each country assisted the ethnic militias that are behind the killing today.    This is an area where the United States should have a high profile, but it is the French-led multinational force that is making news. The U.S. has long provided substantial support to Uganda, due partly to its success in economic development and in combating HIV/AIDS. Rwanda, too, has received significant assistance from the U.S., especially since the 1994 genocide.    Yet U.S. officials are reluctant to deliver public messages about human rights abuses to Uganda and Rwanda. President Bush should go beyond private admonishments and publicly call on the Ugandan, Rwandan and Congo governments not to provide any military or financial assistance to the armed groups in Ituri responsible for massive human rights violations. He should make it clear that the U.S. will use its role as a world leader to seek to end war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ituri.    The Bush administration may not signal new leadership in these two horrific conflicts. But it will trumpet its leadership on the issue of HIV/AIDS, and indeed the administration deserves credit for making that a key priority for U.S. policy in Africa. The question now is how funds for prevention will be spent.    Pressure from conservative religious groups threatens to distort the important U.S. commitments on AIDS by emphasizing """"abstinence-only"""" programs that the Bush team has been heavily promoting in places like Texas. Such programs divert attention from the broader prevention messages that are proven to save lives, including promoting condom use. Abstinence-only programs undermine AIDS prevention efforts in the U.S. - and they're out of touch with the realities of the AIDS epidemic in Africa.    Bush's AIDS initiative shows that he wants to be a leader on issues that matter to Africa, and his recent statements on Africa indicate a willingness to use greater U.S. influence in African crises. But while he is traveling in Africa this week, the U.S. president will find millions of people looking for something more than speeches.","Africa, United States, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda, US Foreign Policy","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

The 57-page report, 'Covered in Blood': Ethnically Targeted Violence in Northern DR Congo, provides evidence that combatants in the Ituri region of northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have slaughtered some five thousand civilians in the last year because of their ethnic affiliation. But the combatants are armed and often directed by the governments of the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda.   A number of treaties and ceasefires, the most recent signed in Burundi on June 19, have supposedly ended the conflict between the governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and the DRC, as well as Congolese rebel movements set to share power with the Kinshasa government. But the minor players-often the proxies for the principals-continue the war.   """"Agreements between governments don't do much good when the government armies are just passing their guns on to local militias,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The crisis in Congo won't be resolved without addressing all levels of this conflict.""""   The majority of the population in Ituri are neither Hema nor Lendu, the ethnic groups whose militias are responsible for much of the current violence. But all inhabitants of Ituri have been forced to choose sides, and are subject to attack because they are thought to be associated with either Hema or Lendu groups.   In recent months, human rights workers have not had access to rural Ituri or been able to provide information about specific massacres of civilians. But the Human Rights Watch report covering events in the past 12 months presents evidence of, among others, a civilian massacre at Nyakunde in early September 2002, where Lendu combatants slaughtered some 1,200 people of the Hema and related groups. Over a 10-day period, the killers dragged victims from their homes and murdered patients found in beds at a missionary hospital. According to Human Rights Watch research, the Nyakunde massacre claimed significantly more victims than has previously been known.   Uganda occupied Ituri, an area rich in mineral resources and potentially a major source of oil, from 1998 to May 2003, when it withdrew its troops under heavy international pressure. During its occupation, Ugandan soldiers provided arms and military training to different ethnic groups, fostering the spread of an initially limited dispute between Hema and Lendu over land..   The DRC government supports and arms the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) which often joins in combat with militia of the Lendu and related Ngiti groups. Rwanda backs the RCD-Goma, a movement split from the RCD-ML, that provides aid to the Union of Patriotic Congolese (UPC), a Hema militia group that has recently controlled the Ituri town of Bunia.   The Human Rights Watch report details how combatants tortured and summarily executed political opponents and raped women of rival ethnic groups. They also engaged in such inhumane acts as the mutilitation of bodies and cannibalism.   """"Violent death is now an everyday occurrence in Ituri,"""" said Des Forges. """"Killers have resorted to cannibalism to terrorize people they want to control.""""   The Human Rights Watch report charges that all groups recruited children, some as young as seven years old, for military service. Local observers describe the fighting forces as """"armies of children.""""   Militia have driven some half a million people from their homes, and looted and burned the dwellings. To weaken their enemies, various militia have impeded deliveries of food or other forms of humanitarian aid to displaced people and others in need, increasing immeasurably the number of civilians dead because of the war. In some thirty cases in recent months they have threatened, beaten, and expelled humanitarian workers.   A United Nations Observer Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), present primarily to monitor ceasefire arrangements, had neither the mandate nor the numbers and equipment needed to protect civilians.   After UPC Hema militia slaughtered hundreds of civilians in Bunia in early May, the U.N. Security Council authorized an Interim Emergency Multinational Force to restore order inside the town. The Multinational Force, consisting mostly of French troops, was the first mission ever deployed by the European Union. It has managed to stop killing inside Bunia, but will end its mission in September.  In September, the U.N. force, strengthened by several thousand more soldiers, will be the only international force present in DRC. The Security Council will soon consider the size and mandate for the force.   """"The Security Council must ensure that civilians in Bunia and elsewhere will be protected after the interim force leaves,"""" said Des Forges. """"They must provide the peacekeepers and the mandate necessary to prevent further ethnic killing.""""","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","International Justice"

South Africa is a key stop for the presidential tour. The country has a vital role to play in ensuring that the visit to Africa is not just symbolic - but also addresses the region's most acute problems, including raging regional conflicts and HIV/Aids.     The visit will provide Bush an opportunity to follow up on his announcement last month at the US-Africa Business Summit that the two continents """"will work together as partners in advancing the security, health and prosperity of the African peoples"""".     America's commitment to these goals has been inconsistent at best, but South Africa also has much room for improvement in playing a leadership role on the continent.     The Bush administration has made a considerable effort to facilitate peace in Sudan. However, the US has failed to commit to protecting civilians in West Africa and the Great Lakes. Suspicious of UN peacekeeping, the Bush government has been unwilling to commit its own political and financial resources.     Liberia is yet another example of the great need and potential for US intervention.     The Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) is ready to send peacekeeping troops into Liberia to preserve the June 27 ceasefire. But the Ecowas troops need support - support that should come from the US.     Liberian President Charles Taylor has been indicted by the Special Court for Sierra Leone for his role in that country's recent civil war and Bush has called for him to step down. But without concrete action - the support of peace efforts in Liberia - such rhetoric is empty.     The US also needs to be a stronger partner for peace and human rights in the Great Lakes region.     A new Human Rights Watch report, Covered in Blood: Ethnically Targeted Violence in Northern DR Congo, provides evidence that combatants in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo have slaughtered some 5 000 civilians in the last year because of their ethnic affiliation.     During his stop in Uganda, Bush should make clear to regional governments that the US will use its full influence to support an end to war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Congo.     In contrast to Bush, President Thabo Mbeki has made a concerted effort to address regional conflict.     His commitment to human rights and good governance has been instrumental in developing institutions for reform, including the African Union and the New Partnership for Africa's Development.     In Burundi and the DRC, Mbeki has led conflict resolution and peace-keeping efforts.     However, on the critical issue of Aids in Africa, Mbeki's record has been less than impressive.     South Africa's HIV epidemic not only threatens the US economy, but also its role as a broker for regional success.     Bush should take advantage of his time in South Africa to urge his counterpart to show greater commitment to fighting Aids and the spread of HIV in South Africa and across the region.     A strong US-South African partnership holds great potential for bettering the lives of millions of Africans. Bush's Aids initiative shows that he wants to be a leader on issues that matter to Africa, as he has stated in his June Africa policy speech.     But when he gets to Africa next week, the US president will find millions of people looking for something more than speeches: concrete and durable solutions for HIV/Aids, and a firm commitment to throwing US resources and weight behind ending the West Africa and the Great Lakes conflicts.","Africa, United States, South Africa","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

(Briefing Paper) Today's certification releases approximately $27 million in military aid. It marks the fifth time in three years that the State Department has certified Colombia despite compelling evidence of non-compliance with six conditions contained in Public Law 108-7, which regulates foreign aid for fiscal year 2003. Colombia receives the third largest amount of U.S. military aid, after Israel and Egypt. The most important condition requires Colombia's armed forces to sever links with paramilitary groups. Yet the Colombian military continues to work with paramilitaries that are included on the State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations. """"At a time when the United States has unprecedented influence over Colombian affairs, this is a missed opportunity to gain real advances,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. failure is especially striking now, since the bulk of the aid-over $300 million-is not subject to human rights conditions. In other words, certification can no longer be explained away as necessary to serve other policy goals, such as the fight against illegal narcotics."""" Vivanco noted that the negative effect of the certification is compounded by the U.S. decision on July 1 to suspend $5 million in military aid to Colombia for its refusal to exempt American citizens from prosecution before the International Criminal Court. """"The Bush administration has consistently argued that it couldn't hold up aid to the Colombian military over its collusion with human rights abusers. Now, it turns out that they're perfectly willing to suspend aid, but only when countries like Colombia resist granting immunity for possible crimes against humanity. This sends a perverse signal about American priorities,"""" Vivanco said. Human Rights Watch delivered a document to the State Department on continuing ties between military units and paramilitary groups. In the department of Chocó, for example, residents of the community of Jiguamandó report that soldiers from the Seventeenth Brigade continue to patrol with paramilitary units. Although the Magdalena River north of the city of Barrancabermeja is heavily militarized, international and national aid workers are routinely stopped, searched and questioned by paramilitaries operating within minutes of military checkpoints administered by the Fifth Brigade. In its document, Human Rights Watch acknowledged that the armed forces were arresting more low-level paramilitaries than in years past. """"However, in vast regions of the country, the military-paramilitary alliance remains as strong as ever,"""" Vivanco said. In addition to human rights conditions, Public Law 108-7 allows the State Department to use funds to train and equip Colombian military units to fight terrorism if it can certify that the Colombian Armed Forces are conducting vigorous operations to restore government authority and respect for human rights in areas under the effective control of paramilitary and guerrilla organizations. According to Human Rights Watch, Colombia has failed to meet this additional condition. In its 11-page response to the State Department decision, Human Rights Watch cited specific cases of non-compliance on each of the six statutory conditions.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

More than 100 governments will gather in New York July 7-11 to assess progress in stemming the trade in small arms since a U.N. Program of Action was agreed two years ago. “Governments have a long way to go to address the scourge of small arms,” said Lisa Misol, arms trade researcher with Human Rights Watch. “They should start by cleaning up their own behavior.” Civilians around the world are at the mercy of small arms-wielding abusers, including those of rebel forces and government armies. In a new briefing paper released today, Human Rights Watch documented numerous recent examples of small arms abuses: Small arms have been misused by governments and rebel forces in Burma, Colombia, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Macedonia, and Nepal, and in fighting in Israel and the Occupied Territories. In post-conflict Afghanistan and Iraq, the widespread availability of small arms has threatened security, undermined the rule of law, harmed peace-building efforts, and put civilians in grave danger. Small arms also are used to carry out abuses in countries not affected by war - such as Cambodia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria, and Serbia. The U.N. Program of Action focuses on preventing illicit trafficking in small arms. It does not deal with misuse and only addresses government responsibility in relation to preventing the illegal arms trade. The U.N. process has helped bring attention to the global problem of small arms and led to progress in some areas, Human Rights Watch noted, but further work is needed. “This human rights crisis demands a human rights response,” Misol said. Human Rights Watch called on governments to prevent and punish small arms misuse, both by government agents and private actors. Governments also should cease authorized arms transfers to abusers and tighten controls to prevent and punish illicit arms trafficking and irresponsible internal weapons circulation. Key elements of a human rights-centered approach to small arms include government action to: Fulfill existing government responsibilities to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law, and ensure that police and armed forces strictly uphold international standards. Ensure adequate laws are in place to punish the misuse of small arms by private actors, and that these are effectively implemented and enforced. Stop authorizing “legal” arms transfers to abusive recipients and adopt binding instruments on arms transfers that contain strong human rights and humanitarian criteria, such as the proposed international Arms Trade Treaty. Close legal loopholes and strengthen lax controls that allow gray market trade in weapons to thrive and hold arms traffickers accountable, including by negotiating binding international treaties on arms brokering and marking and tracing.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Colombia, Guatemala, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Myanmar (Burma), Cambodia, Nepal, Kyrgyzstan, Macedonia, Serbia/Kosovo, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Global","Arms, United Nations"

Only the UN Security Council has the authority and legitimacy to establish such a court, whether an international tribunal or a mixed international and Iraqi court. Proponents of the war inside and outside US president George W. Bush's administration have cited documentation of the atrocities as ample justification for toppling the Baath government. """"The day of Iraq's liberation will also be a day of justice,"""" Bush declared. But now it looks like justice for the perpetrators of the worst crimes - never very high on the administration's agenda - may be traded away for information about the elusive weapons of mass destruction or the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein. This, anyway, was the implication of US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld's recent affirmation that Washington is considering plea-bargaining talks with those former Iraqi officials now in US custody who were featured in the deck of cards distributed by the Anglo-American coalition. Equally disturbing is the fact that the UN Security Council has so far taken no steps to establish an impartial and independent venue for trying those Iraqis suspected of crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes. And the US occupation authorities have still not developed a comprehensive policy to secure the mass gravesites and preserve evidence necessary for identifying victims and initiating prosecutions of those responsible for the killings. The UN Security Council should appoint a commission of experts, as it did a decade ago for the former Yugoslavia. This commission would assess the available evidence on war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Iraqi officials, and serve as a repository for evidence now being uncovered. It would also recommend to the Security Council the most appropriate forum to administer justice for atrocities we know have been committed - whether an ad-hoc international criminal tribunal as in the case of the former Yugoslavia, a mixed international-national tribunal as in Sierra Leone or another mechanism. Establishing such a commission, and possibly an international tribunal, would not affect the ability of the US-led coalition to use military tribunals to deal with Iraqis suspected of war crimes and other violations of international humanitarian law in the current conflict. This is permissible under the laws of war. Nor would it contradict the edict earlier this month of the US civilian administrator, Paul Bremer, creating a new central criminal court composed of 10 Iraqi judges to deal with """"particularly egregious criminals"""" and irregular forces carrying out attacks against US and British forces. However, US military tribunals would have no jurisdiction over past crimes in Iraq. Former Iraqi officials considered responsible for ordering and carrying out crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes should be tried by a tribunal with a composition and mandate appropriate to the enormity of the crimes and the complexity of the task. American officials have said this should be an """"Iraqi-led process,"""" but there are several reasons why this responsibility should not be handed over to an Iraqi judicial system presently in disarray. For one thing, it would be difficult today to find Iraqi jurists who have not been compromised by participating in a court system that was part of the Baath apparatus of repression; or, conversely, who were not linked with opponents of the previous regime, and who hail from communities that suffered under it. Second, trials conducted by judges appointed directly or indirectly by the US civil administration would be widely viewed in Iraq as serving American interests, if not operating under US control. Any justice system that addresses the responsibility of former Iraqi leaders for serious crimes must be impartial, fair and independent, and must be widely perceived as such. Only the UN Security Council has the authority and legitimacy to establish such a court, whether an international tribunal or a mixed international and Iraqi court. Washington's disinterest in such a course has several probable causes. One is the Bush administration's well-advertised aversion to any mechanism that might validate the concept of international justice, and a parallel desire to limit the scope of any inquiry that might scrutinize US actions in Iraq. Second, international tribunals don't permit the use of the death penalty, which the Bush administration favors. Finally, the US presumably wants to retain maximum discretion in its dealings with captured Iraqi leaders, and not have its hands tied by commitments to deliver key individuals to an international tribunal. Unfortunately, the US seems more interested in questions of justice and accountability for past crimes mainly to the extent that these can be used to vilify the old Iraqi regime and justify its military intervention. It is far less interested in seeking justice for the victims and survivors of Saddam Hussein's tyranny.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/03/letter-nigerian-president-obasanjo-regarding-his-second-term","Letter to Nigerian President Obasanjo Regarding His Second Term","Letter to Nigerian President Obasanjo Regarding His Second Term","","07/03/2003","Dear President Obasanjo,   I am writing to you as you begin your second term in office to urge you to give the highest priority to human rights reforms in the period ahead and to ensure that Nigerians across the country are able to enjoy their fundamental rights without fear of violence or discrimination. Your government has repeatedly stated its commitment to human rights, including in the context of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). Human Rights Watch welcomes these statements and is urging you to turn these promises into reality. In particular, we are appealing to you to put an end to the impunity that has protected for too long those who have violated human rights in Nigeria.   Human Rights Watch has been engaged with events in Nigeria for many years. We have been heartened by some developments over the last four years, including greater respect for freedom of expression. However, much remains to be done in the field of human rights, both in terms of remedial and preventive action. We would like to take this opportunity to put forward what we see as some of the areas where government action is needed urgently. We are also enclosing several reports published by Human Rights Watch over the last two years that document these concerns in greater detail and contain recommendations addressed to the Nigerian government.   Oputa Panel   The Human Rights Violations Investigation Commission, known as the Oputa Panel, was welcomed by many inside and outside Nigeria as a sincere and significant effort to shed light on the serious abuses that took place under previous governments. The Oputa Panel submitted its report to your government well over a year ago. We are disappointed to note that neither the report nor any plans to implement its recommendations have been published. This would be an opportune moment to signal your clear intention to make human rights and openness priorities in your government; the publication of the Oputa Panel's report would be an important step towards realizing this goal.   Accountability for grave violations of human rights by the military   In October 2001, several hundred members of the military massacred more than two hundred unarmed civilians in more than seven towns and villages in Benue State. To date, no action has been taken against the members of the security forces responsible, although you acknowledged some responsibility in general apologies issued almost a year later to the leaders and people of Benue. The judicial commission of inquiry established to investigate incidents of violence in Benue and neighboring states has submitted its report to your office, but until now there has been no official public response. Similarly, there has been no action to bring to justice those responsible for the massacre of several hundred people by the military in Odi, Bayelsa State, in November 1999. There can be no justification for the absence of prosecutions for these crimes, which constitute two of the most serious incidents of human rights violations by the military since your government came to power in 1999, and which have been well-documented by Nigerian and international human rights organizations. We urge you to ensure that that those responsible for ordering and carrying out the massacres in Benue and Odi, whatever their rank or position, are identified, charged and tried without delay.   The military has also continued to commit serious abuses in the Niger delta, where it has been mobilized in some areas continuously over the last four years and more. Confrontations between the military and local communities, who frequently protest against oil company operations, environmental degradation and underdevelopment, have led to many human rights violations. The military has responded to community protests (which are sometimes peaceful, but other times take on a violent or criminal nature), with indiscriminate reprisal attacks against entire towns and villages. When inter-communal conflict has erupted in the delta, as well as other areas of the country, the military has often used excessive force in attempting to contain it.   On 4 April 2003, we wrote to you to express our concern about reports of indiscriminate attacks by the military against Ijaw villages in the areas around Warri, in the context of inter-ethnic clashes. In view of the ongoing tensions in the area and the large military presence still deployed there, we remain concerned at the possibility of further outbreaks of violence, including human rights violations by the military against communities perceived as """"causing trouble."""" We urge you to ensure that all members of the security forces, especially those deployed to areas of tension such as the Niger delta, are instructed to respect human rights standards at all times, and only use lethal force where absolutely necessary and as a last resort. Any members of the military suspected to be responsible for violations, including those with command responsibility, should be investigated and prosecuted.   Police reform   While we acknowledge that the high rate of violent crime poses a major challenge to law enforcement in Nigeria, we regret that little action has been taken to date to ensure that the police control crime without systematically violating human rights. We are aware that government officials and the Inspector General of Police have repeatedly announced reforms of the police force. However, to date, the approach to law enforcement still appears to be primarily one of confrontation and violence rather than prevention and respect for the rights of suspects.   Extrajudicial executions by the police remain a chronic problem in Nigeria and the police routinely use excessive force when responding to suspected criminal activities and eruptions of inter-communal violence. Likewise, suspects who are arrested - often arbitrarily - face the prospect of torture, followed by long periods of detention without trial. We are aware of very few cases where members of the police force have been charged and tried in connection with these abuses.   Partly as a response to the police's ineffectiveness in preventing and reducing crime, vigilante groups have developed across Nigeria. However, instead of handing over suspected criminals to the police, groups like the Bakassi Boys and the O'odua People's Congress (OPC) have often killed, tortured and illegally detained suspects, sometimes with the support of state governments. While Human Rights Watch welcomed attempts in 2002 to disband the Bakassi Boys and arrest their members who had committed crimes, we have since been informed that most of those arrested have been released and there have been no prosecutions of members suspected of committing violations. We would be grateful for confirmation from your office on the current status of these cases.   At the same time, police have assaulted and/or detained individuals without evidence of specific criminal wrongdoing, apparently merely for their membership in groups whose self-determination claims are perceived as posing a threat to the government. For example, scores of members of the OPC and of the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) have been arrested, detained and extrajudicially killed by the police. The police force should receive clear instructions that they should only carry out arrests when there is evidence of criminal activity, and that freedom of expression, assembly and association should be respected at all times.   We urge you to ensure that all police officers that commit abuses are removed from duty and are prosecuted; members of vigilante groups responsible for human rights abuses should also be charged and tried. To help guarantee accountability within the police force, the Police Service Commission should be adequately funded to enable it to investigate cases of police abuse and ensure police compliance with its findings.   Preventing inter-communal violence   Thousands of Nigerians have been killed in inter-communal conflicts over the last four years, including at least 2,000 in the Kaduna riots of 2000 and around 1,000 people in Jos in September 2001. Since then, there have been numerous other incidents of inter-communal violence in different parts of the country, in which hundreds of people have been killed without any effective intervention to stop the spread of violence. Prosecutions of those suspected to have orchestrated or encouraged this violence remain extremely rare, despite several judicial commissions of inquiry set up by the government. In many cases, these waves of killings, often triggered by a seemingly minor incident, could easily have been prevented through early intervention by state government officials or community leaders to defuse the tension; likewise, many lives could have been saved if the police had responded promptly to protect the population at the first signs of hostility. We deplore the fact that not only have the security forces failed in their duty to protect, but in many instances actually participated in the violence and were responsible for extrajudicial killings themselves - most recently during the riots in Kaduna in November 2002.   Human Rights Watch does not believe that the Nigerian federal government has instigated or deliberately fueled these conflicts in every case. However, we note a lack of concerted, effective action to prevent them. In many cases, hostility between different groups has been directly or indirectly nurtured by the government's failure to address underlying political or economic tensions or claims of marginalization. Many of these communities' grievances are rooted in historical discrimination on the basis of """"indigene"""" or """"non-indigene"""" status - ill-defined concepts that will continue to cause tension until federal and state governments take firm action to eliminate all forms of discrimination on this basis.   In other cases, state or local level politicians or community leaders have exacerbated explosive tensions for their own political gain. Human Rights Watch urges you to ensure that anyone found responsible for organizing or encouraging violence is brought to justice without delay. We also encourage your government, as well as state governments, to make every effort to prevent further violence by addressing existing sources of conflict between communities in an open forum, with the full participation of all parties involved, including civil society groups and community representatives at the local level.   Accountability for political violence   Human Rights Watch has gathered information indicating that hundreds of people were killed or injured in incidents of political violence in the period leading up to and during the elections of April and May 2003. Gangs of otherwise unemployed youths have been used by politicians of various parties, including the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP), to help them achieve power by terrorizing their opponents and intimidating voters during the elections. While Human Rights Watch welcomed statements from your office and other government officials calling for peaceful elections and fair play among political candidates, we are concerned that few of the officials and candidates implicated in incidents of political violence have been investigated or prosecuted. We urge your government to ensure the investigation and prosecution, as appropriate, of any person responsible for incidents of political violence, regardless of that person's party affiliation. This important step would help restore faith in your government's commitment to justice and fairness in the aftermath of the elections that were severely marred by acts of violence and intimidation in several areas.   Human rights concerns in the context of Sharia   Since several northern states introduced Sharia-based criminal codes over the last three years, we have been concerned about a number of legal provisions and practices that violate human rights. Human Rights Watch does not oppose the Sharia system or any other legal system as such. However, there are aspects of the legislation introduced in these states that do not conform to international human rights standards and that violate Nigeria's obligations under international human rights law. These include punishments that constitute torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment, such as floggings, amputations, and death by stoning. Minors (persons under the age of eighteen) have been among those receiving flogging and amputation sentences, some of which have been carried out. We are also particularly concerned at the absence of respect for due process in many trials in Sharia courts, and the fact that defendants have been sentenced to death and other cruel punishments after trials that were blatantly unfair. Defendants have frequently not had legal representation and have not been informed about their rights and legal procedures. Trials and judgments have been affected by corruption of the judiciary and lack of training of judges.   Some of the problems noted above are not limited to the Sharia jurisdictions. We are equally concerned about human rights violations in the context of other legal systems used in Nigeria, where lengthy pre-trial detention and extensive corruption violate the rights to due process and liberty and security of the person, and where the death penalty remains in force.   While we are aware of the sensitivities surrounding the question of Sharia in Nigeria, we encourage your government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the legislation introduced in the last three years is amended to conform to Nigeria's human rights obligations. We also urge you to eliminate provisions for punishments that constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, rather than prolonging suffering and uncertainty for defendants by waiting for each individual case to make its way through the appeal system, and to ensure that due process is respected in all trials. We also urge you to abolish the death penalty throughout Nigeria.   Human Rights Watch hopes that you will implement the reforms outlined above and other measures that would lead to major improvements in the human rights situation in Nigeria. Strengthening the role of the National Human Rights Commission and providing it with adequate funding to monitor and respond to human rights violations would be positive steps toward establishing a culture of respect for human rights. We encourage you to use the next four years to mark a turning point for Nigeria, through the introduction of lasting and wide-ranging human rights reforms.

The letter identifies several priorities for a new human rights agenda for Nigeria. Since President Obasanjo took office four years ago, the military has not been brought to justice for serious human rights violations, including the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of people in Odi, Bayelsa State, in November 1999, and of more than two hundred people in Benue State in October 2001. “The Obasanjo government must prosecute those members of the military responsible for these horrific crimes,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. “Only then will the government’s commitment to human rights be taken seriously.” The police also have committed widespread extrajudicial executions and have routinely responded to suspected criminal activity with excessive force, the letter said. Security forces have assaulted and detained individuals, sometimes for lengthy periods without trial and without evidence of criminal wrongdoing. Scores of people have been detained apparently on the basis of their membership in self-determination groups. In the oil-rich Niger Delta, entire communities have been indiscriminately targeted by security forces in response to local demands for resource control and protests against environmental damage. Human Rights Watch received reports that security forces fired indiscriminately on villages around Warri, Delta State, during the clashes in Warri in March 2003. Human Rights Watch accused the government of failing to resolve the underlying causes of widespread communal violence, in which thousands of Nigerians have been killed since 1999. Members of the security forces, instead of responding promptly to the first signs of conflict, in many cases committed violations themselves during communal crises. “President Obasanjo has repeatedly emphasized the importance of good governance in Africa, including in the context of the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD),” said Takirambudde. “But in Nigeria, where he should have the greatest chance of effecting change, serious human rights abuses so far have largely not been addressed.” Human Rights Watch also urged the government to investigate cases of political violence, which killed hundreds of people leading up to and during Nigeria’s recent elections, and to prosecute those responsible without regard to political affiliation. Human Rights Watch also urged the government to address human rights abuses that occurred in implementing Sharia and other criminal codes, including lack of respect for due process rights and sentences that constitute torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment. In addition to concern about violations committed since 1999, Human Rights Watch expressed disappointment that the government has failed for over one year to publish the final report of the Human Rights Violations Investigations Commission (known as the Oputa Panel) set up to investigate abuses committed under previous regimes.","Africa, Nigeria",""

The top priority for any peacekeeping troops must be the protection of civilians, who have suffered from abuses by all sides in the Liberian conflict. U.S. President George W. Bush has called on Taylor to step down, but President John Kufuor of Ghana has urged that Taylor be given immunity from prosecution in exchange for leaving office. The Special Court for Sierra Leone recently indicted Taylor as one of those “bearing the greatest responsibility” for war crimes (including murder and taking hostages); crimes against humanity (rape, murder, extermination, sexual slavery); and other serious violations of international humanitarian law (use of child soldiers) committed in Sierra Leone. The indictment charges that Taylor actively supported the rebel Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone’s ten-year civil war. The indictment was announced on June 4, 2003 while Taylor was in Ghana attending peace talks on the recently intensified Liberian conflict. News reports today suggest that the United States is considering sending peacekeepers to Liberia. Human Rights Watch considers it of utmost importance that any military action be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. The force should have a robust mandate to ensure the maintenance of law and order to protect civilians and help ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need. “Letting Charles Taylor off the hook would make it harder, not easier, to bring lasting peace to Liberia,” said Janet Fleischman, Washington Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. “Instead, we should look at how we can build on Taylor’s indictment to ensure accountability for all those responsible for war crimes in Liberia.” Elected president of Liberia in 1997 after a seven-year war ousted former president Samuel Doe, Charles Taylor gained international notoriety for the brutal abuses of civilians perpetrated by his forces in Liberia, and for his use of child soldiers organized in “Small Boy Units.” Taylor’s support for the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone contributed to the deaths, rape and mutilations of thousands of civilians, and led to United Nations sanctions on his regime. Taylor’s forces have also been implicated in conflicts in neighboring Guinea and Cote d’Ivoire. The Ghanaian peace talks produced a ceasefire agreement on June 17, 2003. The ceasefire has been broken by several serious bouts of fighting between the Liberian government and rebel forces in and around Monrovia. The recent conflict has displaced thousands of civilians and exacerbated the already dire humanitarian situation in the country, where the majority of the population was already inaccessible to humanitarian agencies. According to credible sources in Monrovia, several hundred civilians have died in the capital in the past few weeks, both from the fighting and the increasing toll taken by disease. Much of northern and eastern Liberia has been off limits to humanitarian agencies since the resurgence of fighting in March 2003. Taylor, who reportedly stated that he would step down in favor of a transitional government, has recently wavered on that point. His past record of broken agreements and commitments give little grounds for hope that he will fulfill the most recent accords, or that providing him immunity would bring stability. “All parties involved in the Liberia peace talks must respect the Sierra Leone Special Court,” said Fleischman. “Taylor should be handed over to the court to face trial.” The 1999 Lomé peace accord in Sierra Leone purportedly granted an amnesty for crimes committed by all combatants during the civil war on the basis that this was necessary to achieve peace. But once granted amnesty, the rebels resumed military operations, plunging Sierra Leone into two more years of war. The Special Court for Sierra Leone, which has a mandate to bring those who bear the greatest responsibilities for atrocities to justice, is one of the key mechanisms that are now contributing to the restoration of peace in that country.","Africa, United States, Liberia, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

In letters to U.S. President George W.

""""Amnesty for those Iraqi leaders who committed genocide, war crimes, or crimes against humanity would be a devastating affront to the victims of the former Iraqi government,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's international justice program. """"Amnesty deals would signal that justice for the world's most heinous crimes can be brushed aside when it suits governments to do so."""" In outlining the reasons why the United States and United Kingdom went to war in Iraq, both governments cited human rights abuses committed by Saddam Hussein's regime and the need to hold perpetrators accountable. Past experiences with transitional governments have shown that ensuring justice for past abuses is an important component in building respect for the rule of law and securing peace and stability. """"Prosecuting only those senior Iraqi officials who do not provide useful information would be hypocritical and would cast serious doubts about the coalition authorities' proclaimed commitment to justice,"""" said Dicker. Discussions have been underway between the coalition authorities, the United Nations, Iraqi jurists, and non-governmental organizations on how to best hold perpetrators of past crimes accountable. Human Rights Watch and others have called on U.N. Special Representative for Iraq Sergio Vieira de Mello to establish a U.N. Commission of Experts to determine the most appropriate mechanisms for delivering justice for the former Iraqi leadership's crimes and coordinating evidence collection and preservation. """"Once you start giving amnesties to the top people, efforts to achieve accountability will certainly be undermined,"""" said Dicker. For years, Human Rights Watch has advocated justice for past crimes of the Iraqi leadership.

In the genocidal 1988 """"Anfal"""" campaign, more than 100,000 Kurds were trucked to remote sites and executed.

The review should also examine practices of the justice and interior ministries that may have violated basic due process rights of Saudi citizens and foreigners sentenced to death. Human Rights Watch said the cases of two Asian women migrant workers sentenced to death for allegedly killing their employers raise troubling questions about the transparency and fairness of the Saudi justice system in capital punishment cases. Neither woman had access to a lawyer or any other form of legal assistance, and consular officials were not present at their trials. Both women were convicted on the basis of confessions, a common feature of the kingdom's justice system. """"Innocent people may be on death row in Saudi Arabia facing imminent execution,"""" said Virginia Sherry, associate director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Two Asian women migrant workers now on death row are persuasive examples of the need for review and reform: they did not speak Arabic, did not have lawyers, and may have been forced to sign confessions."""" It is not publicly known how many Saudi citizens and foreigners are in prison awaiting the death penalty. At a meeting with Human Rights Watch representatives in Riyadh in January 2003, Major General Dr. Ali bin Hussein al-Harithi, director of the interior ministry's Prisons Administration, declined to provide statistics of the number on death row. The two Asian women migrant workers who are now on death row are Sarah Jane Landicho Dematera of the Philippines, who was sentenced to death in 1993, and Siti Zaenab binti Buhri Rupa of Indonesia, who received a death sentence in 2000. Both women were employed in the kingdom as domestic workers in private households. Sarah Dematera was forced to write down and then sign a dictated """"confession,"""" and was held incommunicado for one year. Siti Zaenab's family was not officially notified of her arrest until two months before her trial. Two migrants rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) - Kanlungan Center Foundation in Quezon City, Philippines, and the Center for Indonesian Migrant Workers in Jakarta, Indonesia - have closely followed the cases and continue to campaign actively on behalf of the women with their own governments and Saudi officials. These NGOs provided information to Human Rights Watch about the cases. """"The pattern of coerced confessions and the weight given to them in court in Saudi Arabia is well established,"""" said Sherry. """"If information about death penalty cases is withheld from family members and others, legal assistance not provided, and trials are not open, it's hard to have confidence in the verdicts."""" Human Rights Watch said that the Saudi government should release statistics and other information about death row prisoners, and create an independent commission of inquiry to examine each case. Members should include experienced defense lawyers, legal scholars, and medical and mental health professionals, who should conduct private in-depth interviews with the defendants. Saudi women should be represented on the commission, particularly in view of the rapport that they can establish with women prisoners on death row. The inquiry commission should fully examine pre-trial detention and trial procedures on a case-by-case basis, and determine: the period of time the defendant was held incommunicado the government body with custody of the defendant during incommunicado detention  treatment of the defendant during incommunicado detention date of any confession and the circumstances under which it was obtained date(s) when family members and other interested parties were informed of the arrest, and the date on which these parties first had access to the defendant date of notification of the charges against the defendant and a description of these charges the defendant's requests for legal assistance, if any date(s) of the provision of legal advice or assistance to the defendant prior to trial The review of trial procedures should include examination of the following: persons notified of the trial date and the method of notification persons present at the trial  witnesses who testified at the trial for the defense and the prosecution, if any  evidence upon which the court's judgment was based use of a confession as evidence, and the content of that confession efforts of the judges to establish the voluntariness of the confession ability of the accused to present a defense to the court  the written judgment of the court Human Rights Watch said that the findings and recommendations of the commission should be transmitted to senior government officials and also made public. Individuals who suffered human rights abuses in the criminal justice system should be released and provided with compensation, or tried again with the guarantees now available under Saudi and international human rights law, including the right to legal assistance during every phase of the legal process.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/02/president-bushs-trip-africa","President Bushs Trip to Africa","President Bush's Trip to Africa","","07/02/2003","U.S. President George W. Bush will be traveling to Africa from July 7-12, visiting Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda, and Nigeria. This packet from Human Rights Watch includes material for each stop along the way.   A brief overview of the Bush administration's policy toward Africa:   In his Africa speech on June 26, Bush stressed three themes: establishing peace and security, the struggle against AIDS, and economic development through aid and trade. The war on terror has also affected the administration's Africa policy.   The Bush Administration's human rights agenda in Africa has been primarily focused on Zimbabwe and, to a lesser extent, Sudan. The primacy of the U.S. war on terrorism has meant that the United States has given even less attention to Africa than might otherwise have been expected. In the few African countries that the administration believes are strategically valuable, particularly in the Horn of Africa, the United States has often de-emphasized human rights issues.   Despite some interest in peacemaking and peacekeeping, the Bush administration has not provided leadership in ending armed conflicts ravaging large parts of Africa, including the wars in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Liberia. With the exception of Sudan, the Bush administration has tended to let the Europeans take the lead in conflict resolution in Africa, as the British have done in Sierra Leone and the French in Côte d'Ivoire and the DRC, while the U.S. merely plays a supporting role.   The Bush administration has showed some interest in training African armies to perform peacekeeping functions, launching the African Contingency Operations Training and Assistance (ACOTA) program. But at the same time, it has threatened to cut military assistance to countries in the region on the basis of their support for the new International Criminal Court. Twenty-one African nations have ratified the ICC treaty. But the Bush Administration has been twisting the arms of African governments to sign bilateral agreements that would give immunity to Americans from prosecution and undermine the integrity of the court. While thirteen African governments have signed such agreements, several important countries - including South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia - have resisted this pressure. President Bush's visit follows the July 1 deadline set by Congress for governments to conclude these deals or risk losing military assistance.   The Bush administration has said that it would use the human rights eligibility criteria of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA and AGOA II) as leverage to press for human rights improvements in Africa. The law states that eligibility for AGOA includes labor rights and human rights criteria, and requires that the annual review of AGOA eligibility include a careful examination of the human rights record of AGOA partners, in addition to their political and economic reforms. Yet even in countries where the AGOA review acknowledges that human rights conditions are poor - such as in Côte d'Ivoire, Eritrea, and Rwanda - AGOA eligibility was granted; only in Eritrea was there any indication of the need for human rights improvements. By failing to consistently use AGOA to press for an end to abuses in recipient countries, the administration risks squandering a potentially useful tool in the promotion of human rights in Africa.   The Bush administration also launched the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA), expanding development assistance available for countries that are, in President Bush's words, """"ruling justly, investing in people, and encouraging economic freedom."""" While the legislation for MCA is still pending in Congress, the Bush administration holds it up as a new approach to development assistance. The eligibility criteria for assistance through the MCA do not explicitly include human rights, but address broader issues of good governance. The impact of MCA in Africa is likely to be minimal, since only a couple of African countries are expected to qualify.   Energy security remains a key concern for the Bush administration. The administration specifically highlighted its interest in pursuing African oil resources as substitutes for oil from the Middle East. Although the U.S. periodically raised the issue of transparency and good governance in countries like Angola, it appeared to place a greater priority on solidifying relationships with major and emerging African oil producers. Little or no public mention is made by U.S. officials of the extrajudicial killings and other abuses by Nigerian security forces in the Niger Delta oil region or elsewhere.   Human rights defenders and other civil society activists constitute a highly dynamic force for change in Africa. Yet these activists frequently operate in limiting political environments and face serious security risks, including in Côte d'Ivoire, the DRC, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Liberia, Sudan, and Zimbabwe. Human rights advocates play a central role in holding governments accountable and promoting the conditions needed for sustainable development. They deserve the Bush administration's full support. During his visit, President Bush should seek meetings with civil society and human rights activists and underscore the U.S. commitment to help open the political space for them to operate, and to defend them when they are attacked by governments or rebel groups that seek to silence them.","Africa, United States, Angola, Benin, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Central African Republic, Chad, Comoros, Congo (Brazzaville), Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Eswatini (formerly Swaziland), Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, US Foreign Policy","Health, International Justice, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, International Criminal Court"

High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson and four other human rights organizations in an amicus (""""friend of the court"""") brief in support of the petitioners. Prof. Harold Hongju Koh of Yale Law School and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor was counsel of record for the amici. The amicus brief argues that the principles of privacy and equal protection being examined by the court should be interpreted in light of the rulings of foreign and international courts of nations with similar histories, legal systems, and political cultures.  According to the amicus brief, these court rulings have rejected the understanding of the right to privacy found in the court's decision in Bowers. To the contrary, the weight of international and foreign court authority establishes that sexual conduct between same-sex partners involves precisely the kind of intimate decisionmaking and familial relationships that have been protected under the right to privacy, and that sexual conduct between same-sex partners in the home can be protected without also committing courts to protecting """"adultery, incest, or other sexual crimes"""" in the home.  The brief also argues that international and foreign courts have invalidated same-sex sodomy laws for betraying naked prejudice and a """"bare . . . desire to harm a politically unpopular group"""" inconsistent with the court's rulings on equal protection.  Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's majority opinion and Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent both make reference to international law and standards:  Writes Kennedy: [A]lmost five years before Bowers was decided the European Court of Human Rights considered a case with parallels to Bowers and to today's case. An adult male resident in Northern Ireland alleged he was a practicing homosexual who desired to engage in consensual homosexual conduct. The laws of Northern Ireland forbade him that right. He alleged that he had been questioned, his home had been searched, and he feared criminal prosecution. The court held that the laws proscribing the conduct were invalid under the European Convention on Human Rights. Dudgeon v. United Kingdom, 45 Eur. Ct. H. R. (1981) 52. Authoritative in all countries that are members of the Council of Europe (21 nations then, 45 nations now), the decision is at odds with the premise in Bowers that the claim put forward was insubstantial in our Western civilization. To the extent Bowers relied on values we share with a wider civilization, it should be noted that the reasoning and holding in Bowers have been rejected elsewhere. The European Court of Human Rights has followed not Bowers but its own decision in Dudgeon v. United Kingdom. [citations omitted] Other nations, too, have taken action consistent with an affirmation of the protected right of homosexual adults to engage in intimate, consensual conduct."""" See Brief for Mary Robinson et al. as Amici Curiae 11-12. The right the petitioners seek in this case has been accepted as an integral part of human freedom in many other countries. There has been no showing that in this country the governmental interest in circumscribing personal choice is somehow more legitimate or urgent. Scalia criticizes the use of international law in his dissent: Constitutional entitlements do not spring into existence because some States choose to lessen or eliminate criminal sanctions on certain behavior. Much less do they spring into existence, as the Court seems to believe, because foreign nations decriminalize conduct. The Bowers majority opinion never relied on """"values we share with a wider civilization."""" [citation omitted], but rather rejected the claimed right to sodomy on the ground that such a right was not """"'deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition'"""" [citation omitted]. The Court's discussion of these foreign views (ignoring, of course, the many countries that have retained criminal prohibitions on sodomy) is therefore meaningless dicta. Dangerous dicta, however, since """"this Court . . . should not impose foreign moods, fads, or fashions on Americans."""" [citation omitted]. Lawrence v. Texas is a landmark decision on the constitutional right to privacy of gays and lesbians in the United States; it may also prove to be an important decision for the incorporation of international human rights law into U.S. jurisprudence.","United States","LGBT Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/07/01/india-gujarat-massacre-cases-sabotaged","India- Gujarat Massacre Cases Sabotaged","India: Gujarat Massacre Cases Sabotaged","","07/01/2003","(New York) The ringleaders of massacres committed in 2002 are still roaming free in Gujarat, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today. The 70-page report, Compounding Injustice: The Government's Failure to Redress Massacres in Gujarat, examines the record of state authorities in holding perpetrators accountable and providing humanitarian relief to victims of state-supported massacres of Muslims in February and March 2002. Human Rights Watch urged the federal government to take over cases of large-scale massacres where the state government has sabotaged investigations. On June 27, a Gujarat state court acquitted twenty-one people accused of burning alive twelve Muslims in a bakery in Vadodara. Thirty-five of the seventy-three witnesses reportedly retracted in court the statements they had given to the police identifying the attackers. """"The government's record on the massacres is appalling,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"Sixteen months after the beginning of the violence, not a single person has been convicted."""" More than one hundred Muslims have been charged under India's much-criticized Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA) for their alleged involvement in the train massacre in Godhra. No Hindus have been charged under POTA in connection with the violence against Muslims, which the government continues to dismiss as spontaneous and unorganized. Although the Indian government initially boasted of thousands of arrests following the attacks, most of those arrested have since been acquitted, released on bail with no further action taken, or simply let go. Police regularly downgrade serious charges to lesser crimes - from murder or rape to rioting, for example - and alter victims' statements to delete the names of the accused. Even when cases reach trial, Muslim victims face biased prosecutors and judges. Hindu and Muslim lawyers representing Muslim victims, and doctors providing medical relief to them, have also faced harassment and threats. Hundreds of women and girls were brutally raped, mutilated, and burnt to death in Gujarat. The police have refused to pursue these cases. In numerous instances, and in an effort to cover up their own participation in the violence, the police have instituted false cases against men and women injured in police shootings. Living conditions for more than 100,000 people displaced by the violence continue to be grossly inadequate. For months they resided in makeshift relief camps with little support from the state. By the end of October 2002, the government had closed most of the camps, forcing some families back into neighborhoods where their attackers still live and where their security is continuously threatened. Most people interviewed by Human Rights Watch received negligible amounts to compensate for the destruction of their homes, ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand rupees, or less than one hundred dollars. Hindus in Gujarat have suffered as well, Human Rights Watch said. Thousands of small businesses owned by Hindus closed down during the violence. The relatives of the Hindus killed in Godhra have been denied redress and some face economic destitution. The Human Rights Watch report also documents and strongly condemns the September 2002 massacre of Hindus at Akshardham in Gandhinagar, Gujarat's capital. Hindu nationalist groups continue to arm civilians in Gujarat and many other Indian states. Instead of cracking down on these groups, the Gujarat state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has included the distribution of arms as part of its election manifesto. In December 2002, the BJP won by a landslide in Gujarat state elections. Using posters and videotapes of the Godhra massacre, and rhetoric that depicted Muslims as terrorists intent on destroying the Hindu community, the party gained the most seats in areas affected by the communal violence. In states that go to the polls later this year, such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, potentially explosive campaigns are already in full swing. Members of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (World Hindu Council, VHP) are distributing weapons similar to those used in Gujarat, as well as literature depicting Muslims as sexual deviants and terrorists. Members of both communities live in fear that a simple altercation could become the pretext for large-scale violence. The Human Rights Watch report also examines the recruitment of Dalits (so-called untouchables) and tribals (indigenous peoples) in the violence against Muslims in Gujarat, and the subsequent scapegoating of these communities in police arrests. Since the events of last year, Christians in the state have also come under renewed administrative, legislative, and physical attack. The Human Rights Watch report includes forty detailed recommendations to Indian authorities and the international community. Human Rights Watch called on the Indian government to act immediately to prevent further attacks, end impunity, and deliver meaningful assistance to those displaced and dispossessed by the violence. Testimony from the report Compounding Injustice: The Government's Failure to Redress Massacres in Gujarat Khalid Noor Mohammed Sheikh lost nine family members in the February 2002 massacre in Naroda Patia, Ahmedabad, including his pregnant thirty-year-old daughter Kauser Bano. Her belly was cut open and the fetus was pulled out and hacked to pieces before she was killed: I took [my daughter] Kauser to the hospital for delivery the day before the attack. She was ready to deliver. But the doctor said there was time and to come back in the morning. But there was no morning after. By then it was all over. And the tragedy is that the people who ripped my daughter's child out of her body and killed her are walking about freely. Why does it have to be this way?… Please make every effort that the criminals get punished. Even if they don't get punished a lot, they should at least get punished a little…. They keep going on about Muslim terrorists, but who are the terrorists? Those who torture Muslims so much should be punished a bit. In a family of nine, I am the only survivor. Whom should I live for now? R. Bibi's thirty-six-year-old son was killed by the police in Naroda Patia: A lot happened that day. The crowds came. Everything was destroyed. We didn't know what was going on, that something was going to happen. We were just doing our work. Suddenly there was an attack. They were raping women. Then they were killing them, burning them and cutting them up into pieces. The police killed my son. They shot him…. The government tells us to bring proof when we go to ask for [compensation]…. My life was taken away when they shot my son. Everything has been taken away and now they want evidence, where will I get the body from? I wasn't even able to see his body…. They stole everything, they burnt everything, they killed people, and [Rs. 1,250 (U.S.$27)] is all we got. Now my daughters go and do housework in other people's homes. They wash dishes, they sweep and clean…. We find some way to fill our stomachs. Somehow we have to survive…. It's too much. Even now we have no relief. Nishith Acharya is a volunteer at the Akshardham cultural complex in Gandhinagar and was an eyewitness to the September 2002 massacre of Hindus there: They threw something inside, a grenade, into the bookstore. By God's grace it did not explode in the bookstore. One middle-aged lady tried to come out. They fired on her, and she was immediately killed. They started moving ahead and went to the podium. I had no weapons and no one in the campus had weapons [so as] to preserve the sanctity of the place…. They threw a grenade inside [an exhibition hall]. It exploded and they started firing on the public. Many people were injured. There were many casualties…. People were killed there also. One volunteer opened all the doors to let the people out. So they threw a grenade at the entrance part and did firing also. Maximum casualties were there…. The room was full of blood.","Asia, India","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

The American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) revokes military assistance to countries that have ratified the ICC unless they conclude a separate bilateral agreement with the United States by July 1, agreeing never to hand over U.S. personnel to the ICC.     Despite a yearlong campaign by the U.S. diplomatic corps, only about 48 countries have signed such agreements so far, the majority of them small and poor countries that have not ratified the ICC treaty anyway and therefore have no obligation to transfer U.S. personnel to the court.     """"U.S. ambassadors have been acting like schoolyard bullies,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice program at Human Rights Watch. """"The U.S. campaign has not succeeded in undermining global support for the court. But it has succeeded in making the U.S. government look foolish and mean-spirited.""""     The letter cites several examples of U.S. hardball tactics:   U.S. Ambassador Richard Blankenship publicly warned the Bahamas that if it did not support the U.S. position on the ICC, a significant amount of U.S. aid would be withheld, including funds for paving and lighting an airport runway.      An Assistant Secretary of State informed foreign ministers of Caribbean states that they would lose the benefits for hurricane relief and rural dentistry and veterinary programs if their governments did not sign.      """"U.S. officials are engaged in a worldwide campaign pressing small, vulnerable and often fragile democratic governments,"""" said the Human Rights Watch letter, signed by executive director Kenneth Roth. """"Because most ICC member states are democracies with a relatively strong commitment to the rule of law, the threatened aid cutoffs represent a sanction primarily targeting states that abide by democratic values.""""     The exact number of countries that have signed bilateral immunity agreements is unclear, since some of the agreements are """"secret."""" But at least 38 of them are classified as """"less developed"""" or """"least developed"""" countries by the United Nations Development Program index.     Most of the ICC's 18 judges come from countries closely allied with the United States.

Estimates of civilians killed by Obote's forces in the Luwero triangle around the capital, Kampala, range from 100,000 to 300,000. Prisoners in military custody were systematically tortured. After he was deposed in a May 1985 military coup, he fled and now lives unmolested in Zambia.  Chad's former president, HISSÈNE HABRÉ, lives in exile in Senegal. A Chadian Truth Commission accused Habré's 1982-1990 government of tens of thousands of political murders and systematic torture. With Human Rights Watch's help, Chadian victims filed charges against Habré in Senegal, where he was indicted in February 2000 on charges of torture and crimes against humanity, before the Senegalese courts ruled that he could not be tried there. Habré's victims are now seeking his extradition to stand trial in Belgium, where charges were also filed, and Senegal has agreed to hold him pending an extradition request. Last year, a Belgian judge and police team visited Chad to investigate the charges, and the government of Chad waived any state immunity which Habré might seek to assert. In July, the Belgian government announced that the Habré prosecution could go forward despite the repeal of the Belgium's universal jurisdiction law.  More information on the Habré case can be found at https://www.hrw.org/en/habre-case.   MENGISTU HAILE MIRIAM is living in Zimbabwe, which has refused Ethiopia's extradition request to stand trial for crimes committed between 1974 and 1991. During this period, tens of thousands of political opponents were killed, in particular during the """"Red Terror"""" campaign of 1977-1978. Hundreds of thousands of government opponents, including members of the Oromo ethnic group, former Imperial Government officials, student Marxists, and peaceful critics were arbitrarily imprisoned. Torture of political prisoners was systematic and widespread. When Mengistu went to South Africa in November-December 1999 for medical treatment, the government failed to act on calls from human rights activists that he be arrested and did not acknowledge an extradition request from Ethiopia until Mengistu had returned to Zimbabwe.  Generals RAOUL CEDRAS and PHILIPPE BIAMBY led a bloody coup against the constitutionally elected President of Haiti, Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. During their dictatorship, thousands were killed, tortured and raped. When President Aristide was restored, the two were flown to Panama, where they were granted asylum. Panama has refused Haiti's extradition request, even though Panama ratified the Torture Convention in 1987 and has laws allowing for the prosecution of torture committed abroad. Generals Cedrás and Biamby were convicted in absentia by a Haitian jury for their participation in an April 1994 massacre in the slum of Raboteau, in which army forces killed about 20 people. Rejecting a request by Human Rights Watch that the pair be prosecuted or extradited, the Panamanian foreign ministry stated in November 1999 that """"it would be a dangerous precedent to grant the right of asylum to resolve a political problem in a neighboring country and later deny the rights of those given asylum.""""  EMMANUEL """"TOTO"""" CONSTANT, the leader of Haiti's """"FRAPH"""" death squad who now lives in New York, is wanted by Haitian prosecutors to face charges of murder, torture and arson carried out during Cedrás' de facto rule. He was also convicted in absentia for the Raboteau massacre. Constant has admitted to receiving regular payments and encouragement from the CIA while he built his terror network. When Aristide was restored to power, Constant was ordered to appear in court, but he fled to the United States where he was arrested in March 1995. U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, calling FRAPH """"an illegitimate paramilitary organization whose members were responsible for numerous human rights violations in Haiti,"""" asked for his immediate deportation to Haiti. Constant was instead released from custody pursuant to a secret agreement between the U.S. government and Constant - revealed by the Baltimore Sun - which would allow the death squad leader to """"self-deport"""" at any time to a third country of his choice, effectively allowing him to escape justice in Haiti, which has sought his extradition.  ALFREDO STROESSNER of Paraguay now lives in Brazil. The Stroessner dictatorship (1954 to 1989) used widespread torture against political opponents. Stroessner was also an ally of Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile in """"Operation Condor,"""" a multinational network of police and military operations throughout Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay who routinely practiced torture, disappearances and murders while carrying out a """"dirty war"""" against suspected leftists in the region. JEAN-CLAUDE """"BABY DOC"""" DUVALIER, Haiti's """"president for life"""" (1971 - 1986), is living in France. The Duvalier dictatorship is accused of thousands of political killings and arbitrary detentions. In September 1999, four Haitian torture victims filed complaints with a French prosecutor charging crimes against humanity. The prosecutor rejected the complaints, however, on the grounds that they did not fit the pre-1994 French definition of crimes against humanity which applied only to crimes committed on behalf of Axis powers during World War II, and that they could not be brought under the 1994 law on crimes against humanity, which was not retroactive.   Since leaving Peru with the collapse of his rule in 2000, former Peruvian President ALBERTO FUJIMORI has lived in comfortable exile in Japan. The authoritarian nature of the Fujimori regime exacerbated Peru's human rights crisis, which was characterized by torture, forced disappearances, and extrajudicial executions. Peru is seeking his extradition to face charges of human rights crimes and corruption, though Japan has indicated that it will not extradite Fujimori, whom it considers a Japanese citizen.","Africa, Americas, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, Chad, Ethiopia, Uganda","International Justice, Torture"

The International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (MWC) enters into force on July 1, 2003, having been ratified or acceded to by 21 states. The Convention provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of migrants - regardless of their legal status - by transit countries, sending countries, and host countries alike. The Convention now has legal effect for those states that have ratified it, and its implementation will be overseen by an expert committee. """"Fears of terrorism and economic insecurity have prompted a backlash against migrants and other foreigners in many countries,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"Migrant workers are vulnerable at the best of times, but they now need protection more than ever."""" Human Rights Watch warned that many governments, including Australia and Spain, equate efforts to curb illegal immigration with the international campaign against terrorism. In the United States, hundreds of non-citizens of mostly Arab and South Asian descent have been detained, often arbitrarily, by the immigration service as part of the government's investigation into the September 11 attacks. Most have since been deported from the United States after secret immigration hearings, but many suffered lengthy detention under unduly harsh conditions. The MWC has been ratified or acceded to by Azerbaijan, Belize, Bolivia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cape Verde, Colombia, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Mexico, Morocco, the Philippines, Senegal, Seychelles, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Uganda and Uruguay. But to date, not one major industrialized country has ratified the MWC, despite the important contribution migrant workers make to their economies. Some developed countries have been reticent about joining the Convention for fear that it may afford too many rights and entitlements to undocumented migrants. """"The Migrant Workers Convention is not soft on illegal immigration,"""" said Mungoven. """"All it asks is that undocumented migrants be treated in full compliance with the law, and not subjected to abuse.""""

Powell Secretary of State U.S. Department of State   Dear Secretary Powell:   I am writing to convey our strong dismay over recent U.S. government actions towards the International Criminal Court (ICC).   We are familiar with the Bush administration's deep reservations towards the court. Administration officials have frequently expressed their concern about the ICC's potential to become a politically motivated vehicle advancing an anti-American agenda. While we strongly believe the treaty contains ample safeguards-- many of which were crafted by U.S. negotiators -- I am not writing to defend the efficacy of those checks and balances.   U.S. officials are engaged in a worldwide campaign pressing small, vulnerable and often fragile democratic governments to sign bilateral agreements with Washington. As you know, these agreements would exempt 270 million Americans and foreign nationals working under contract to the U.S. government from the authority of the court. While we believe the agreements the United States is proposing violate the ICC treaty by going beyond the letter and spirit of Article 98, I am not writing to argue the unlawfulness of these instruments.   Whatever the administration thinks of the International Criminal Court, its tactics in pursuing these bilateral agreements are unconscionable. Other governments can plainly see that punitive measures are being used primarily against poor and relatively weak states with few options other than to give in to the United States. Signing an agreement will put an ICC state party in breach of its legal obligations and at odds with other important national interests. This raw misuse of U.S. power makes the policy all the more objectionable.   The administration's hostility to the International Criminal Court is particularly ill-conceived given the progress made in establishing the ICC on the strongest possible basis. The confidence of governments worldwide in the court has been strengthened by the recent inauguration of 18 qualified, competent judges. Most of these jurists come from countries closely allied with the United States. The election of Luis Moreno Ocampo, most recently the Robert F. Kennedy Visiting Professor of Latin American Studies at Harvard Law School, as the court's Chief Prosecutor has further enhanced the court's credibility. No one believes Moreno Ocampo is likely to indulge in unwarranted prosecutions of American citizens.   In this context I want to draw your attention to the tactics U.S. officials are taking in their campaign to obtain bilateral agreements. We are aware of many examples of American diplomats going far beyond the provisions of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA) to pressure small countries. This excessive pressure cannot be blamed on the ASPA. The following examples crystallize our profound concern.   Croatia: U.S. Ambassador Lawrence Rossin has recently published an article in Croatia (it is on the U.S. Embassy website) raising questions about the viability of Croatia's accession to NATO if Zagreb does not sign a bilateral immunity agreement.   Bahamas: U.S. Ambassador Richard Blankenship has publicly warned that if the Bahamas did not support the U.S. position on the ICC, a significant amount of U.S. aid would be withheld, including aid for paving and lighting an airport runway.   CARICOM: We understand that on May 23, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Stephen Rademaker told foreign ministers of the CARICOM that they would lose the benefits of the New Horizons program if they did not sign agreements. The program, originally conceived to provide hurricane relief to countries at risk from tropical storms, now includes rural dentistry and veterinary programs.   Comoros: According to a Comorese diplomat, the United States has informed his country that a previously promised USAID project has been relocated to Djibouti following the latter's signing of a bilateral agreement.   Niger: According to a senior Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, the United States has threatened to suspend cooperative development projects if Niger does not sign a bilateral agreement.   Honduras: Government officials and legislatures have stated that the United States threatened important non-military assistance to Honduras if an agreement was not ratified by July 1.   Bosnia: Before Bosnia's signature and subsequent ratification of an agreement, Bosnian Foreign Minister Mladen Ivanic said that the U.S. message was that it would be """"very difficult to continue military and other assistance"""" if Bosnia did not sign. We understand that Bosnia was told that the Department of State would review """"dispensable programs,"""" including economic aid.   Furthermore, while the American Servicemembers' Protection Act pertains only to ICC states parties, U.S. diplomats have obtained agreements from twenty-six non-states parties as compared to nineteen states parties. These non-states parties have no obligation to cooperate with the court.   We have also heard of cases where U.S. pressure is chilling state interest in ratifying the ICC treaty.   The Philippines: According to Philippine government officials, quoted in the local media, the United States has linked $30 million in additional military assistance to prevent Manila from ratifying the ICC Treaty.   Georgia: Government sources have told Human Rights Watch that ratification of the ICC Treaty is stalled in the President's office as """"a direct consequence of U.S. pressure."""" Georgia has already signed an immunity agreement.   It would be good to know whether these accounts are exaggerated, or as I suspect, not only true, but part of a larger pattern. Such demands on the part of the United States weaken support for the rule of law worldwide and respect for human rights. They also deplete increasingly scarce U.S. diplomatic capital and credibility.   Moreover, because most ICC member states are democracies with a relatively strong commitment to the rule of law, the threatened aid cutoffs represent a sanction primarily targeting states that abide by democratic values. Indeed, we find it ironic that at a time when the United States has been increasing assistance to countries with poor human rights records like Pakistan and Uzbekistan, it is threatening to cut aid to struggling democracies in the Caribbean, Latin America, and Africa over this issue.   U.S. diplomats have tried to blame the European Union's support for the ICC as the cause of pressure many small countries feel in """"choosing"""" between the United States and Europe. It is clear, however, that the pressure is coming from the United States, since the European Union is not threatening punitive measures over the ICC. These pressures are perceived as petty and mean-spirited by the U.S. government's closest allies. Indifference to this resentment is particularly counterproductive at a time when the U.S. is seeking global cooperation in the fight against terrorism.   We urge you to bring an end to the vendetta against the ICC that U.S. diplomats around the world have been compelled to carry out. This is an initiative that is likely to do far more harm to the United States than it could ever do to the court. This campaign is creating a legacy that will tar the Bush administration for years to come. With everything else taking place in the world today, the United States ought to adopt a wiser approach to the International Criminal Court.

Cavallo's transfer is the first time that one country has extradited a person to another country to stand trial for abuses that happened in a third. Cavallo's Argentine victims, like the Chilean victims of General Augusto Pinochet, sought justice in Spain after the courthouse doors in their home countries were shut in their face by amnesty laws. Spain indicted Cavallo, as it indicted Pinochet, under the principle of """"universal jurisdiction"""": the rule that every state has an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the worst international crimes, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or victims. Universal jurisdiction has been incorporated into a number of treaties seeking to make sure that there is no """"safe haven"""" for those responsible for the most serious crimes. Since the end of the Second World War, the list of crimes giving rise to universal jurisdiction under international law has grown to include genocide, torture, war crimes, apartheid and other crimes against humanity. In the landmark Filartiga case, in which the family of a Paraguayan torture victim living in the United States sued his torturer, who had moved to New York, a US court said: """"The torturer has become, like the pirate and slave trader before him, hostis humanis generis, an enemy of all mankind."""" Universal jurisdiction by national courts complements the role of the new International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction is not retroactive and which covers only crimes committed on the territory of the 90 states that have ratified the ICC treaty, or by their nationals. Ironically, the Cavallo extradition comes at a time when the principle of universal jurisdiction is under attack from the United States. The Pentagon apparently wants to immunise itself from any legal restraint on its conduct by barring even the theoretical possibility that top US officials could be judged by the ICC or the courts of another state. It used to be said: """"Kill one person and you go to jail, kill 20 and go to an insane asylum, kill 20,000 and grant yourself an amnesty.""""

The MWC provides a comprehensive framework for the protection of the human rights of this economically important yet vulnerable population of more than 150 million worldwide. In many countries, migrant workers face discrimination and abuse. They may be excluded from certain forms of employment or denied access to social services. They may be subject to exploitative and hazardous working conditions, and even violence at the hands of their employers. Many undocumented migrants are denied basic rights to due process, and sometimes suffer ill-treatment by officials. Migrant workers have become even more vulnerable to abuse in the context of measures taken in the fight against terrorism. Since its adoption by the United Nations General Assembly in 1990, the MWC has been signed by thirty-one states; twenty-one states have become parties to the Convention. But legal protection for migrants' rights will only be comprehensive when the Convention has been ratified by a broad range of states, including those that host large migrant worker populations.

Powell  Secretary of State U.S. Department of State 2201 C Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20520   June 27, 2003   Dear Secretary Powell:   We write to share some concerns about the U.S. State Department's third annual Trafficking in Persons Report (Trafficking Report). The Trafficking Report has the potential to become a powerful tool to address trafficking worldwide. However, persistent shortcomings seriously undermine its effectiveness. We urge the State Department to remedy those shortcomings in future reports.   As you know, trafficking in persons threatens the lives, health, dignity, and security of millions of people throughout the world, with women and children suffering the brunt of the abuses. Trafficking is a blatant violation of human rights and is almost universally condemned, yet many countries are failing to address this problem seriously.   Human Rights Watch has documented and monitored trafficking in persons for more than a decade. We have advocated for increased respect for the human rights of victims of trafficking and for greater accountability of traffickers. For example, we have investigated trafficking of persons from Eastern Europe to Bosnia and Herzegovina; in West African countries such as Togo, Gabon, Benin, Nigeria, Niger, Ghana, and Côte d'Ivoire; from Bangladesh to Pakistan; from Burma to Thailand; from Nepal to India; from Thailand to Japan; and from North Korea to China.   Based on our experience and consultations with nongovernmental and other organizations working to end trafficking around the world, we have the following concerns about the Trafficking Report:      The report does not meaningfully evaluate anti-trafficking efforts. The Trafficking Report lauds governments' efforts to combat trafficking, such as initiating information campaigns, setting up victim service programs, and proposing draft legislation, but generally does not evaluate the content or effectiveness of such measures. For example, some country chapters note that legal services are provided to victims, but do not assess the quality of the services. Other chapters indicate that governments have established inter-ministerial task forces to combat trafficking in persons, but do not evaluate their work. Draft trafficking legislation is mentioned in some chapters without assessing the adequacy of the draft legislation. To maximize its usefulness, the Trafficking Report must do more than superficially list anti-trafficking measures. It must assess the quality of those measures. For example, it should answer questions such as: Are the victim service programs appropriately designed and funded, and are they effectively assisting victims in practice? What are the inter-ministerial task forces mandated to do, and have they succeeded? Does draft legislation cover trafficking into all forms of forced labor and provide adequate victim services and witness protections?  The report inconsistently uses statistics. Statistical data are spotty in the Trafficking Report. While some chapters provide basic data on the numbers of trafficking victims, arrests, prosecutions and convictions, many more do not. The Trafficking Report should explain the absence of such data. It should also urge governments to compile and publish statistics on trafficking in persons disaggregated by age, sex, nationality, and the nature of their forced labor.  The report fails to weigh and condemn harmful immigration policies: The report notes that some countries summarily deport or incarcerate trafficking victims but does not condemn these practices as further victimizing of trafficked people. A country that summarily incarcerates or deports a victim of trafficking essentially punishes the individual for being a victim of a human rights abuse and eliminates any chance for the victim to seek redress or medical or other attention. Such practices call into question a country's commitment to protecting the rights of victims of trafficking and the government's genuine understanding of trafficking as a human rights abuse.  The report credits countries without trafficking legislation. The Trafficking Report credits many countries for their anti-trafficking efforts even when they have not passed legislation specifically criminalizing trafficking into all forms of forced labor, or when they have failed to ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which supplements the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking Protocol). In our view, it should be a minimum requirement for all countries ranking in Tier 1 that they have legislation specifically criminalizing all forms of forced labor as trafficking and providing remedies and assistance to victims. While legislation is just the beginning of providing a legal structure to address trafficking, and laws alone do not guarantee state action, passing legislation is vital to the effective prosecution of traffickers and to ensure that the victims' rights are respected.  The report lacks specificity. The Trafficking Report is often vague or cursory. For example, some chapters note that prosecutions occurred, but fail to explain whether those prosecutions were completed and their results. At a minimum, the Trafficking Report should specify whether a country's legislation penalizes trafficking into all forms of forced labor (not just forced prostitution), which types of government agents are complicit in trafficking, and what measures have been taken to investigate and prosecute them. The Trafficking Report should include whether the country is failing to investigate and prosecute trafficking offenses vigorously, and what appear to be the reasons for such failure; whether the country has effective government-funded witness protection and victim services programs to which all trafficking victims have access; and whether the country is a party to the Trafficking Protocol.  The report fails adequately to explain the criteria for Tier movement. The Report does not adequately explain the criteria applied when countries move from one Tier to another. For example, the Report does not explain why Benin was moved from Tier 2 last year to Tier 1 this year. We believe the decision was inappropriate, given that Benin has not ratified the Trafficking Protocol and has no national legislation criminalizing all forms of trafficking. The Trafficking Report should describe the justification for moving countries from one Tier to another. Failing to do so jeopardizes the credibility of the Trafficking Report's Tier system.   Despite our serious concerns, we note that the Trafficking Report has improved since last year, in part by including more countries, better organizing the country narratives, ensuring that the report includes information on trafficking into many forms of forced labor, and including more discussion of domestic (internal) as well as international trafficking. However, this important document still needs significant improvement.   To protect the rights of millions of trafficking victims around the world, and prevent others from being trafficked, we ask that you ensure that all future reports evaluate the effectiveness of anti-trafficking efforts; include disaggregated statistics on trafficking victims and prosecutions; urge all countries to enact anti-trafficking legislation and bar any countries that do not have such legislation from Tier 1; provide more specificity on issues such as corruption, prosecutions, and service programs; and better explain the criteria for moving countries from one Tier to another.   Absent a deeper and clearer evaluation of governments' anti-trafficking records, the Trafficking Report risks becoming a public relations opportunity for states that inadequately protect trafficking victims and fail to punish traffickers.   We thank you for your attention to the concerns raised in this letter and hope to meet you to discuss these issues further.   Sincerely,   LaShawn R.

Jail Should Lift Chaplain Ban","","06/25/2003","The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department should reverse its decision to bar a chaplain from the Men’s Central Jail, Human Rights Watch said today. Citing privacy concerns, the department revoked Javier Stauring’s access to the jail on June 20, one day after he publicly criticized detention practices for youths in the jail. In a letter to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Human Rights Watch urged the chaplain's reinstatement. Stauring had spoken at a protest in front of the jail, questioning whether harsh conditions in the jail were a factor in suicide attempts by two boys on May 24. One of the boys had a history of mental illness and had previously attempted suicide while in police custody. The department initially told a second chaplain, the Rev. Greg Boyle, that he would also be denied entry to the jail, but it later stated that Father Boyle’s access had not been revoked. “The sheriff’s department is attacking the wrong problem in the wrong way,” said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children’s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. “There are some serious allegations of abuse in the jail, and the department’s first priority should be to take a hard look at them.” Two youths in the jail have attempted suicide in the last month and others have spoken to Human Rights Watch and to news reporters about abusive conditions there. Human Rights Watch interviewed the two chaplains and reviewed the press coverage of their public statements, concluding in its letter to the department that the two had not acted improperly. In their remarks, the two had described overall conditions in the jail. The news reports also identified specific youths and provided details about their cases, but in every instance the accounts came from the youths themselves or their family members. The juvenile module in the Men’s Central Jail holds between 30 and 50 youths under the age of 18, more than any other adult jail in California. Most of these youths are pretrial detainees; a handful is serving sentences of less than one year. Youths in the juvenile module are generally locked in windowless single cells for twenty-three-and-a-half hours each day. In addition to a 30-minute period each day to shower and make telephone calls, they have three hours of recreation once each week in individual rooftop cages containing a pull-up bar and a telephone. Other than these periods, family and attorney visits, and trips to the nurse, they remain in their cells with little or nothing to do. Human Rights Watch began an investigation of detention conditions for youths at the jail at the beginning of the year, and it toured the Men’s Central Jail on May 14. The organization wrote to the sheriff’s department after the two suicide attempts, calling for a thorough review of mental health services at the jail.","United States, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

On the contrary. The Prime Minister seems eager to go out of his way to make things easy. Eager - and wrong. In some respects, Blair's attitude is understandable. There are many reasons why Britain should want a friendly relationship with Russia, in a post-Iraq world more than ever. Nor has Putin's presidency been all bad. Tax reforms have helped to improve the Russian business climate, and judicial and legal reform have been introduced, including the adoption at last of a new criminal procedure code. For many observers, however, the list of problems - including freedom of the press and the routine use of torture in police custody -- remains longer than the list of achievements. It is possible to find mitigating circumstances which explain why Putin's successes in dealing with the Soviet legacy have been modest. Nothing, however, can excuse the Russian leader for the ignominy of his own legacy - the continuing war in Chechnya. Four years ago, Putin's determination to crush the separatist rebels in Chechnya by force helped to elect him by a landslide. In the meantime, the effect of his anti-terrorist campaign has proved catastrophic. Chechen rebels commit attacks on civilians inside and outside Chechnya, and have opened a new wave of terror attacks in recent months. Russian soldiers and policemen die in Chechnya daily; survivors bring their abusive war experience back into civilian life. Hundreds of thousands of Chechens have been displaced; tens of thousands live in neighbouring Ingushetia, in miserable conditions and under the constant threat of forcible return to Chechnya. Russian troops in Chechnya continue routinely to execute, """"disappear"""", torture, and arbitrarily detain civilians. By failing to bring perpetrators to justice, the Russian government has cultivated a climate of impunity that encourages a proliferation of such abuses. Meanwhile, Putin seeks to persuade world leaders that the situation in Chechnya is """"normalising"""". Independent witnesses agree that the referendum held in March - which Blair praised this month, as if it were a substantial step towards a stable democracy - was a fiction; the alleged 85 per cent turnout is in sharp contrast to eyewitness accounts of deserted polling stations. (Lord Judd, the Council of Europe's special rapporteur on Chechnya, resigned in protest at the conditions in which the referendum took place.) Surreally, Putin describes Russian actions in Chechnya as a """"contribution to the global war on terror"""". In reality, the unchecked brutality of the Russian forces helps to feed that terror every day. Recently released official statistics, as well as Human Rights Watch research, show that the human rights situation is getting worse. Officials have admitted the existence of 49 mass graves containing the remains of nearly 3,000 civilians, and provided shocking figures on disappearances, indicating that at least 60 people are disappeared in Chechnya every month. We will never know whether those who are detained by Russian forces have any connection with global terrorism, because the truth disappears along with those who are detained. Aishat Mazhieva lost her husband and three sons in Grozny in a single night in January. Several dozen masked armed men arrived in armoured personnel carriers at the family home on Yablochnaya Street in the middle of the night. They forced their way into one apartment and took away Mazhieva's husband and youngest son, while others detained her two other sons in adjacent apartments, where they lived with their families. All four Mazhievs were driven away, and have not been seen again. Aishat wept as she showed me photographs of her youngest son Arbi, a 19-year-old dancer who had recently returned from a tour with his ensemble to Moscow, Warsaw and Paris. """"Why him?"""" she kept asking me. """"Why did they take him?"""" Last week, Tony Blair expressed his hope that he and Putin may agree """"both on the need for human rights but also on the need for a complete end to any form of terrorism emanating in Chechnya"""". I wonder whether he understands what kind of anti-terrorist measures he thus associates himself and his country with. I wonder if he understands that """"but also"""" is not the best way to link human rights protection and fighting terrorism. And finally, I wonder if he realises that he has a unique opportunity to raise the Chechnya problem in unambiguous terms at last. He may choose to believe that the conflict in Chechnya is over, and that a viable political process is now under way. He may choose to persuade himself - because that is the easier choice. In a famous couplet written two centuries ago, Pushkin perfectly summed up the depressing problem we see in Downing Street today. """"It is so easy to deceive me - For I am glad to be deceived."""" President Putin can be comfortable in the knowledge that Tony Blair seems determined not to admit the truth - let alone act on it. That failure does a disservice to Chechnya, to Russia, and the world.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia, United Kingdom","Press Freedom, Torture"

In a new briefing paper, Human Rights Watch said use of the commissions under current military orders and instructions will fall far short of international due process standards. Military commission trials of terrorist suspects under the existing rules will violate the basic rights of the accused, produce verdicts of questionable legitimacy, and send a message to the world that justice can be jettisoned in the fight against terrorism, Human Rights Watch said. “The commissions are a discredit to American traditions of justice,” said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch’s U.S. Program. “The Department of Defense should go back to the drawing board.” The Department of Defense has incorporated certain due process safeguards to the proposed commission proceedings, including making the trials public, requiring proof beyond reasonable doubt for conviction, presentation of evidence and cross-examination of witnesses. But these provisions provide a patina of due process to proceedings that otherwise remain seriously flawed. Among the problems with the current rules: 1) Lack of Independent Judicial Oversight. The rules limit appellate review of the commissions to a specially created military panel appointed by the Secretary of Defense. President Bush has final review of commission convictions and sentences. The executive branch is thus prosecutor, judge and jury, and, potentially, executioner. There is no independent judicial review of verdicts, no matter how erroneous, arbitrary, or legally unsound. 2) Violation of Rights of POWs. The lack of independent appeal is a particularly grave fault if the commissions are used for people who should have been considered prisoners of war, such as the Taliban detainees at Guantánamo. Prisoners of war (POWs) are entitled to at least the same procedures as the detaining power would give its own troops accused of comparable crimes. In the United States, that means a court-martial, with appeal to a civilian court. The failure to follow this procedure for people who should be POWs would be a war crime. 3) Restrictions on Right to Counsel. Commission rules require defendants to be represented by military defense counsel. Defendants may put civilian counsel on their defense team but a military lawyer must remain on the team as well. 4) Limitations on Effective Defense. The commission rules place severe limitations on the ability of defense lawyers to communicate confidentially with their clients, to travel and to conduct the investigations and research necessary for their case. For example, attorney-client conversations may be monitored by the government; attorneys may not talk about any aspect of the case with prospective witnesses; and all research must be done at the site of the commissions (presumably Guantánamo Bay). In addition, civilian counsel, even if they have the requisite security clearance, may not be given access to all the materials presented to the commissions. 5) Censorship of Defense Counsel. The rules impose a gag order on defense counsel, preventing them from speaking with the press or the public unless they receive prior approval from military officials. Some limitations on defense counsel’s ability to comment publicly continue even after the trials have ended. 6) Military Trial of Civilians. The military commissions will be permitted to try persons who were never combatants and whose connection to armed conflict may be tenuous at best. For example, a non-U.S. citizen living in the United States who has financially contributed to al-Qaeda could be prosecuted before the commission for “aiding and abetting” the enemy. With U.S. courts fully functioning, there is no justification for subjecting civilians to military trial and violating their right to a hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. 7) Second-Class Justice for Non-Citizens. Under the President’s Military Order, U.S. citizens may not be tried before the commissions, regardless of whether they were enemy combatants who committed war crimes. This exclusion presumably reflects a political judgment that the U.S. public would not accept the truncated justice of military proceedings for U.S. citizens. International human rights law, as well as U.S. constitutional law, does not permit the United States to discriminate between citizens and non-citizens with regard to their fair trial rights.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo, Guantanamo - Military Commissions"

Nazarbaev is making an official visit to Canada this week. While in Canada, he is meeting with Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and top business leaders. The Toronto Committee of Human Rights Watch urged Canadian officials and the business community to press President Nazarbaev to address the human rights crisis in his country. “Kazakhstan’s vast energy wealth has made it an important geostrategic partner for many countries, but it has not made the country more democratic,” said Clayton Ruby, co-chair of Human Rights Watch’s Toronto Committee. “Instead, the government is trying to protect its monopoly on political and economic life by undermining basic freedoms.” Human Rights Watch said Canadian officials and business leaders should impress upon President Nazarbaev that these freedoms are essential on their own merits and for stable development. Recent Human Rights Watch field research in Kazakhstan found that the government has led a crackdown on opposition political parties, the media, and certain nongovernmental organizations in a drive to limit political competition. Police have arrested and harassed members and supporters of two of Kazakhstan’s more dynamic and well-funded political parties. Fourteen opposition party members and supporters now face arbitrary civil and criminal charges, in some cases in order to prevent them from running for public office; most are from the Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (DVK) and the Republican People’s Party of Kazakhstan (RNPK). The DVK leader, Galymzhan Zhakianov, is serving a seven-year sentence on abuse of office and financial mismanagement charges following a trial that international experts found to be deeply flawed. The RNPK leader has been living in exile. Opposition activists also face threats of job dismissal in retaliation for their political involvement, police actions to preventing them from organizing and attending party gatherings, and sometimes intimidating visits from law enforcement and security agents. Mostly due to a new law on political parties, the number of political parties dropped this year from nineteen to seven. “The trend is clear—the Kazakh government wants to avoid genuine political competition so that it cannot be held accountable to the public,” said Ruby. Kazakhstan could have as much as 30 to 50 billion barrels of oil and has attracted considerable investment in the hydrocarbons sector. But high-level government officials have been implicated in corruption scandals involving oil revenues. Allegations emerged in 2000 that the Kazakh government secretly held about U.S. $1.4 billion in Swiss bank accounts. Also, a U.S. federal court has indicted two American businessmen on charges of corruption in their transactions with energy deals. The Kazakh government is eager to stop exposure of corruption scandals involving oil contracts, and to avoid transparency of oil revenues. Editors and journalists who tackle these and other controversial topics have been victims of attacks and beatings by unknown individuals. The government also targets them for criminal libel cases. One of them, Sergei Duvanov, is now serving a three-year prison term on charges of statutory rape, following a deeply flawed trial. Duvanov had also been the target of an anonymous attack and a criminal libel suit. The government is now adopting new measures to control the work of nongovernmental organizations that work on sensitive issues. It harasses them though intimidating police visits, arbitrary investigations by the tax police, and surveillance by law enforcement and security agents. The government has also resisted efforts at full transparency of how oil revenues are spent. “As the country’s wealth grows, the government is misusing revenue, consolidating power, and closing political space. Kazakhstan is starting to look like another case study in how oil windfalls bolster dictatorships rather than foster democracy,” said Ruby. Human Rights Watch called on Canadian officials to urge President Nazarbaev to have Galymzhan Zhakianov and Sergei Duvanov released, pending an independent review of the charges against them, and to foster a more constructive environment for the media and political parties. Kazakhstan has won international praise for achieving rising GDP growth, stabilizing its macroeconomic situation, and receiving a Moody’s investment grade, the first country of the former Soviet Union to do so. But at least 27 percent of the population still lives below subsistence level, and many social indicators have dropped or remained low. “In the wake of an oil boom, it looks like the benefits are concentrated in the hands of a few who are more than willing to crack down on the rest,” said Ruby.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Canada, Kazakhstan",""

On June 17, chief editor Sayeed Mir Hussein Mahdavi and deputy editor Ali Reza Payam Sistany of Aftab (The Sun) were arrested on the orders of Afghanistan's chief justice with the approval of President Karzai. The editors' arrests come as Afghanistan undertakes the vital public process of debating its future constitution. """"The government's message to journalists is clear: 'You are not protected,'"""" said John Sifton, Afghanistan researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"In Afghanistan today, dominant government officials or powerful clerics can order journalists arrested, and President Karzai won't stop them. The situation has grave implications for Afghanistan's future constitutional debates."""" According to government officials familiar with the case, Afghanistan's chief justice, Fazl Hadi Shinwari, a cleric allied with the ultra-conservative mujahidin leader Abdul-Rabb al-Rasul Sayyaf, a powerful political leader in Kabul, ordered the arrests and the closure of the paper with the approval of President Karzai. Aftab had recently published two articles raising questions about Islam's place in politics and methods of interpreting religious texts, and criticizing Afghan religious leaders. The Supreme Court charged Mahdavi and Sistany with the crime of """"insulting Islam,"""" or blasphemy. The existing penal code of Afghanistan does not define blasphemy, but provides that certain crimes relating to Islam are punishable under shari'a (Islamic law). Crimes under shari'a are not codified or defined under Afghan law, but under most interpretations of shari'a, blasphemy is a serious offense sometimes punishable by death. The deputy chief justice, Fazel Ahmad Manawi, said in an interview with Radio Liberty on June 19 that Mahdavi and Sistany would be tried on the """"allegation of insulting Islam,"""" and that international pressure could do nothing to stop the government from pursuing the case. The two are currently being held in a Kabul jail. Kabul police searched and then closed Aftab's offices last week, and Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the Amniat-e Melli, confiscated remaining copies of the newspaper from local booksellers and stores. Amniat-e Melli agents broke up a meeting held by Aftab last Thursday and harassed and threatened participants. Kabul police allowed Aftab's offices to reopen this week, but told Aftab staff that they are prohibited from printing future issues. Human Rights Watch spoke with Mahdavi and Sistany from jail twice in the last week, and with other journalists and government officials familiar with the case. Several officials familiar with the case said that President Karzai himself had approved the arrest, and turned down requests by Afghan government officials, United Nations representatives and international diplomats for their release. According to one official, Karzai indicated that the arrests were lawful because the editors """"had insulted Islam."""" Several Afghan ministers have called on President Karzai to release the two editors. Human Rights Watch considers the blasphemy charges against Mahdavi and Sistany to be in violation of their fundamental right to freedom of expression. """"The right to freedom of expression means that individuals and journalists have the right to express their non-violent views openly without fear of legal sanction,"""" said Sifton. """"It does not matter how unpopular those views might be."""" Human Rights Watch said the arrests and closing of Aftab were the latest in a long line of press attacks under the post-Taliban government dating back to 2002. Human Rights Watch previously raised concerns about increasing press attacks in a press release in May 2003. """"These arrests couldn't come at a worse time,"""" said Sifton, noting that Afghanistan is currently in the process of drafting a new constitution and preparing for elections in 2004. """"How can Afghans voice their opinions about the current constitutional drafting process, and discuss issues of religion and government, when writers are being arrested for blasphemy, newspapers are being closed, and meetings broken up?"""" Human Rights Watch called on President Karzai to order the immediate release of Mahdavi and Sistany and dismissal of charges against them. Human Rights Watch also called on Karzai to lift the ban on Aftab's publication, and reaffirm publicly the right of journalists and writers to publish freely.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The Justice Department announced today that it was dropping criminal charges against al-Marri and that he would instead be held without charge by the U.S. military. “The Bush Administration has once again done an end run around the criminal justice system,” said Wendy Patten, U.S. advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “It is invoking the laws of war in the United States to justify locking people up without charge and without access to a lawyer. This kind of military detention has no place in a country committed to the rule of law.” Al-Marri is the third person held in the United States under military authority as an “enemy combatant.” Human Rights Watch maintains that there should be a strong presumption that anyone arrested in the United States, far from any battlefield, be granted the full legal protections of the criminal justice system – including the right to counsel and not to be held without charge. Human Rights Watch disputes the government's contention that international humanitarian law, commonly referred to as the laws of war, permits the president to unilaterally designate al-Marri an """"enemy combatant."""" The United States cannot declare a criminal suspect, including a suspected member of al-Qaeda, an enemy combatant, except where there has been direct participation in an international armed conflict. International humanitarian law is inapplicable outside areas of armed conflict and where there is no direct connection to an armed conflict. Instead, the protections of international human rights law apply. In the case of a person detained in the United States, the protections of U.S. constitutional law apply as well. These protections include the rights to be formally charged and permitted access to counsel. “Rather than afford al-Marri basic due process and other constitutional guarantees, the Bush administration has circumvented these rights by unilaterally designating him an enemy combatant,” said Patten. “The government is claiming a virtually unlimited power to deprive people of their liberty and hold them incommunicado based only on the president’s say-so.” According to news reports, al-Marri, who lived in Peoria, Illinois, has been in U.S. custody since December 2001. He was first held as a material witness and then later charged with lying to the FBI and credit card fraud.","United States, Racial Justice",""

The prior Bush Administration sought Senate approval for the Convention and the US is a party. In ratifying the Convention the United States said that it """"considers itself bound by the obligation under Article 16"""" in addition to the obligations of Article 2, which it pledged to apply insofar as it meant the same thing as the Constitution's prohibition on """"cruel and unusual"""" punishment. The Bush Administration deserves credit for the work it is doing to address the problem of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment outside of the United States. The United States is a leading contributor to the UN Voluntary Fund for the Victims of Torture. The annual State Department human rights reports address torture and """"other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment"""" around the world. Many US officials work hard to combat cruel treatment overseas.  The demise of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein governments also brought to an end two regimes that used torture and cruel treatment on a massive scale. At the same time, the war against terrorism raised serious concerns about the treatment of suspects both abroad and in the United States.  Therefore, we welcome President Bush's statement issued today making clear that the United States will neither """"torture"""" terrorist suspects, nor use """"cruel and unusual"""" treatment to interrogate them. We also strongly welcome the further elaboration of that statement in a letter today from Department of Defense General Counsel William Haynes to U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy. The letter states that """"United States policy is to treat all detainees and conduct all interrogations, wherever they may occur, in a manner consistent"""" with the longstanding U.S. interpretation of the prohibition of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in the Convention Against Torture. The letter also makes clear that any illegal conduct by U.S. personnel will be investigated, and, if appropriate, prosecuted.  There has been a great deal of speculation concerning numerous media reports over the last six months alleging that the United States was using cruel, inhuman and degrading interrogation practices known euphemistically as """"stress and duress."""" The President and the Defense Department have today unequivocally rejected the use of any techniques to interrogate suspects that would constitute """"cruel"""" treatment prohibited by the US Constitution.  The Bush Administration has already stated, in a brief submitted to the Supreme Court in Hope v. Pelzer, that handcuffing a prisoner to a """"hitching post"""" in the hot sun for seven hours clearly violates the Constitution's prohibitions on """"cruel and unusual"""" punishments. The President's statement, based on the existing caselaw interpreting the """"cruel and unusual"""" standard, clearly bars most if not all of the kinds of conduct that have been alleged in recent media reports: physical abuse, shackling prisoners or making them stand in uncomfortable positions for long periods of time, prolonged sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme heat and cold, or withholding water, food or medicines.  The welcome message that the Bush Administration has sent today would be reinforced if it granted full access to independent human rights monitors to assure the world that this pledge is being fully redeemed in practice.  President Bush's statement repeats the pledge that his father's Administration made to the Senate and that the United States made to the world when it ratified the Convention - to unequivocally forbid the use of any cruel and unusual treatment in the detention and interrogation of suspects.

On the eve of their June 24 Camp David summit, Human Rights Watch sent separate letters to President George W. Bush and President General Pervez Musharraf, urging them to make human rights a priority on their agenda. """"President Bush is in a unique position to influence General Musharraf on Pakistan's poor human rights record,"""" said Brad Adams, Asia Division Director of Human Rights Watch. """"And General Musharraf should question President Bush about illegal detentions at Guantanamo and post-9/11 immigration policies that have violated the rights of non-citizens."""" Since coming to power in 1999, General Musharraf has unilaterally imposed a series of far-reaching amendments to the Pakistan constitution under the Legal Framework Order (LFO). These amendments dramatically strengthen the power of the presidency, formalize the role of the army in governance, and diminish the authority of elected representatives. General Musharraf has been unwilling to give parliament the right to validate or reject the LFO and has thereby created a real constitutional crisis in Pakistan. Opposition legislators have been tortured, harassed and persecuted for voicing their disagreement with these arbitrary changes to the Pakistani constitution. Meanwhile, in contrast to this extensive constitutional tampering, various laws discriminatory to women have been left intact. Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration to insist that the government of Pakistan take concrete measures to end its practice of using torture to stifle criticism and silence political opponents. """"Perpetrators of torture should be removed from Pakistan's security forces and prosecuted,"""" said Adams. """"President Bush must raise with Gen. Musharraf the troubling implications of the Legal Framework Order and ask for a timetable to genuine elections."""" Human Rights Watch also urged General Musharraf to raise with President Bush the legal status of those people, including as many as 100 Pakistanis, detained at Guantanamo Bay. Human Rights Watch has called for the release of Taliban prisoners-of-war and others who have no connection to Al-Qaeda and who have not been criminally charged. Human Rights Watch has also raised serious concerns about the proposed military commissions authorized to try them. """"The Guantanamo detainees have disappeared into a black hole in the American legal system,"""" said Adams. """"The United States has an obligation to treat all detainees in accordance with international law, and Musharraf should tell Bush that."""" President Bush has repeatedly said that the war against terrorism is a war of values, but has been unwilling to speak out in favor of those values with close anti-terror allies such as General Musharraf.

Human Rights Watch also expressed concern over the government’s detention and interrogation of a prominent Egyptian human rights activist as he was returning from a conference abroad. On June 8, 2003, the New Woman Research Center received a letter from the Ministry of Social Affairs rejecting its application to register under the terms of a new law governing the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The letter stated that “security agencies do not approve the registration of the aforementioned foundation.” Several days later, the ministry again cited objections by state security to deny the application of the Land Center for Human Rights to register a new entity, Awlad al-Ard (Sons of the Earth). “These two groups have been spotlighting important human rights issues for years,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “By refusing to give them legal status, the government has confirmed that the new NGO law is intended to stifle civil society.” The New Woman Research Center, founded in the early 1990s, raises public awareness of women’s rights issues, including female genital mutilation and domestic violence. The Land Center for Human Rights, founded in 1996, works on economic and social rights issues, primarily in rural areas. The center has produced a series of reports on agricultural child labor, land tenancy issues, and environmental problems, as well as other topics. On June 15, Egyptian immigration authorities detained and questioned Mohamed Zarea, director of the Cairo-based Human Rights Center for the Assistance of Prisoners (HRCAP), as he was returning from a regional human rights conference in Beirut. According to the HRCAP, Zarea was interrogated for an hour about the conference and the views of participants. The HRCAP said that Zarea refused to cooperate and was eventually cleared through Egyptian immigration. Law 84/2002, passed by the People’s Assembly on June 3, 2002, requires existing groups to apply for registration with the Ministry of Social Affairs as NGOs within one year of the law’s passage in order to operate legally. Most Egyptian human rights groups have submitted applications, but in most cases they did so shortly before the June 3, 2003 deadline and have not yet heard from the Ministry of Social Affairs, which has sixty days to approve or reject the application or request changes in the group’s statutes. Human Rights Watch pointed out that article six of the law requires the government to justify any rejection in terms of noncompliance with the law. “There is nothing in the law requiring clearance by the security services,” Stork said. “In banning these two groups the government has gone beyond even its own restrictive legislation.” According to information received by Human Rights Watch, the ministry has held up the registration of at least one other NGO pending the removal of certain board members considered objectionable by government security services. The New Woman Research Center has filed an appeal in the Administrative Court against the government’s decision. Law 84/2002 and the executive statute for its implementation contain vaguely-worded provisions which tighten state control over NGOs and severely compromise the right to freedom of association. The statute bars groups that the state determines to be “threatening national unity [or] violating public order or morals” (Article 11). NGOs are prohibited from receiving funds from abroad without ministry approval (Article 17; Executive Statute, Article 58). The Ministry of Social Affairs must approve nominees to the governing boards of NGOs (Article 34) and can deny requests to affiliate with international organizations (Article 16). The ministry can dissolve an NGO at will, as well as freeze its assets and confiscate its property, without a judicial order (Article 42). The law provides criminal penalties for unauthorized NGO activities (Article 76). Persons who form “clandestine organizations” can be punished with one year’s imprisonment and a substantial fine—in effect criminalizing many forms of informal or grassroots organizing. A person who receives donations on behalf of an NGO without ministry approval can be sentenced to six months in prison. Persons carrying out the activities of an NGO prior to its formal registration are liable to a three-month prison term. “In Egypt as elsewhere, the state has a legitimate interest in registering civil societies, but in a way that allows citizens to exercise their basic political rights,” Stork said. “Neither the letter of this law nor its implementation so far demonstrate good faith on the part of the government. If the past is any guide, the authorities will use this legislation to pounce on any group whose activities cross the very low threshold for dissent in Egypt today.” Law 84/2002 passed the People’s Assembly despite widespread opposition from NGOs, which called attention to the unreasonable powers it gave the state. A similarly restrictive NGO law had been passed in 1999, but was struck down, largely on technical grounds, by Egypt’s Constitutional Court one year later. Many groups have until now functioned as companies registered under various provisions of Egyptian civil law. However, Law 84/2002 requires such groups or companies to re-register under its provisions in order to carry out NGO activities legally.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

Security Council should hold governments in West Africa accountable for their support of abusive regimes and rebel groups, Human Rights Watch said in a briefing paper presented to the Security Council today. Members of the Security Council are scheduled to begin an eight-day trip to the region on June 28. The ten-page briefing paper, “The Regional Crisis and Human Rights Abuses in West Africa,” charts a range of regional problems that contribute to the deteriorating human rights situation, including: the current crisis in Liberia, the proliferation of arms and mercenaries, regional refugee flows, and illicit state support to Liberian rebel groups from Guinea and Côte d’Ivoire.  The briefing paper says that regional governments and rebel groups have committed serious abuses against civilians in Côte d’Ivoire and Liberia. Most of eastern Liberia is reportedly under rebel control and has been inaccessible to humanitarian agencies since at least March. Liberia’s Charles Taylor was indicted by the Sierra Leone Special Court on June 4 for his role in abuses in Sierra Leone. “Just a month ago, Côte d’Ivoire was the big concern, today it’s Liberia,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “This downward spiral in the region must be stopped, which means addressing the main human rights abusers throughout the region and improving protection of civilians.” Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council to further investigate the ways in which human rights abuses fuel conflicts throughout the region, and to hold perpetrators accountable. Takirambudde stressed that states and rebel groups are responsible for abuses, and called on the Security Council to take steps to cut off their supplies of weapons and financing. The briefing paper highlights abuses in the war in Côte d’Ivoire, and described the country as on a “precipice.” Human Rights Watch called for immediate implementation of the human rights component of the U.N. mission in Côte d’Ivoire. Human Rights Watch also called on the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) rebel faction to release all abducted civilians, and for all the warring parties to ensure the protection of civilians in Liberia.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, International Justice, United Nations, Internally Displaced People, Children and Armed Conflict"

There have been some significant positive developments in the region in the past year, namely progress in the restoration of peace and accountability in Sierra Leone. At the same time, the West African sub-region has experienced two serious setbacks: the outbreak of conflict in Côte d'Ivoire and the resurgence of the Liberian war.   These latter two developments present serious threats to the stability of all bordering states. The past eight months of armed conflict in Côte d'Ivoire, and in particular, the patterns of human rights abuses in the western part of the country, are a renewed reminder of the need to address the underlying causes of an ever-shifting regional crisis. The resurgence of the Liberian war, with even Monrovia under threat from rebel advances in the past few weeks, is fundamental to the problems in the region, but is only one element in what has clearly evolved into a regional crisis, with the responsibility for abuses shared by numerous regional actors.   We welcome that the terms of reference for the trip include the links between the conflict in Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, and Sierra Leone. Focusing solely on the government of Liberia, without considering the responsibility of all regional players, would fail to address the causes of the crisis, which stems in part from the impunity of too many regional actors. For this reason we have included Guinea in this overview of concerns, despite its omission from the terms of reference, due to its integral role in the region's security and humanitarian crises.   While the Special Court for Sierra Leone represents an important attempt to end the cycle of violence and impunity by holding accountable those who bear the greatest responsibility for gross abuses of human rights, more efforts are needed to investigate and document the ways in which human rights abuses continue to fuel conflicts throughout the region, and to hold perpetrators accountable. In particular, the United Nations has a critical role to play in: consistently condemning all perpetrators of human rights abuses, whether they are state or non-state actors; limiting the ability of state and non-state actors to carry out abuses by cutting off supplies of weapons and financing; and creating effective mechanisms to increase the accountability of regional and local authorities to their populations.   The flow of arms and combatants, including mercenaries, across porous borders paired with the willingness of regional governments to support insurgent groups against neighbors is a dangerous combination. Developments in the past year in Côte d'Ivoire highlight the serious potential for a constant regional cycle of conflict and destabilization as armed groups produce new cycles of human rights abuses, internally displaced persons and refugees, and child soldiers.   Human Rights Watch has monitored West Africa for over a decade, through regular missions as well as a field presence for over three years in Sierra Leone. Earlier this year we conducted ten weeks of field investigation in Côte d'Ivoire and neighboring countries. With the terms of reference for your trip in mind, we would like to offer the following analysis and recommendations.  Liberia: Upsurge in Fighting and Humanitarian Crisis  The recent peace talks in Ghana produced a ceasefire accord on June 17 signed by the government of Liberia and the two rebel groups. Over the past six months, Liberia has returned to full-scale armed conflict. Many of the members of the Liberian rebel groups were part of other warring factions in Liberia's brutal war of 1989 -1996. With the support of neighboring governments, they have now re-grouped and re-armed, and have initiated a new phase of war in Liberia. The main rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD), operates from bases in northern Liberia's Lofa county and from Guinea, where it has that government's support. A second rebel group called the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL), which has recently split from the LURD and is reportedly receiving support from the Ivorian government, has also made territorial gains and currently occupies most of southeast Liberia. With the exception of Monrovia and parts of Nimba County, which remain under government control, the majority of Liberian territory is reported to be in the hands of the two rebel movements. Following the Sierra Leone Special Court's June 4 announcement of the indictment and arrest warrant against President Charles Taylor, the rebel groups approached within a few kilometers of Monrovia, prompting mass displacement of civilians in and around the town.   Both the government of Liberia and Liberian rebel forces are responsible for violations of international humanitarian law amounting to war crimes and other serious human rights abuses. President Taylor himself has now been indicted for his role in supporting abuses against civilians during the war in Sierra Leone. In Liberia, tens of thousands of people have been forcibly displaced and hundreds if not thousands of civilians have been killed, either deliberately or in crossfire. Recent human rights abuses committed by both sides include the forced recruitment of children in displaced and refugee camps, forced labor, assault, and sexual violence against civilians, as well as attacks on humanitarian workers. The inflow of arms in breach of the U.N. embargo (see below) contributes to such abuses. The Liberian government has continued its intolerance of dissent, and civil society actors - especially human rights activists and independent journalists - continue to face harassment, intimidation, and imprisonment. The LURD rebel group continues to abduct and forcibly recruit civilians, as was recently documented during their April attack on the Jahtondo area. The MODEL group has also been responsible for abuses against civilians, particularly in western Côte d'Ivoire, where Human Rights Watch documented incidents of forced labor, rape, and the recruitment and use of child soldiers.   Fighting between the Liberian government and rebel groups spread to all three neighboring borders in 2003. As of March 2003, incidents at Bo Waterside, on the Sierra Leonean border, Ganta near the Guinean border, and Toe town and Zwedru, near the Ivorian border, reflected the increasing regional involvement in the Liberian war, with attacks taking place both along and across borders. Due to the fighting and the lack of security guarantees for aid workers, most of the country is currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies. Thousands of displaced Liberians, Ivorian refugees, and ECOWAS nationals who fled the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire are currently beyond reach of urgently needed international humanitarian assistance and protection. Many of these civilians are in territory under the control of the Liberian rebel groups. Following the combat on the outskirts of Monrovia in early June, thousands of civilians fled displaced persons camps and are currently sheltering in the capital in appalling conditions. Reports of newly recruited and armed children continue to emerge from both Monrovia and rebel-held areas.   The Security Council must address the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Liberia by calling on all the warring parties to 1) cease abuses against civilians, including summary executions, abductions, rape, theft of food and other items essential to their survival, 2) end recruitment of children and demobilize existing child soldiers, and 3) ensure that international humanitarian agencies are guaranteed secure access throughout Liberia to civilians in need of assistance and protection, including through cross-line and cross-border operations from neighboring countries. Protection of civilians must be a priority, and if the ceasefire agreement holds then any intervention force deployed in Liberia must be provided with Chapter VII peace-enforcement authorization to best ensure the protection of civilians.   In addition, the Security Council should take further steps to end illicit arms flows to the Liberian government and to end the support of abusive insurgent Liberian groups by neighboring countries. The U.N. Peace-building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL), which has not adequately raised human rights concerns, should be expanded and given the resources and clear mandate to conduct human rights monitoring, investigation and reporting, activities that have long been and will continue to be urgently required in Liberia.   Human Rights Watch urges Members of the United Nations Security Council to:  Call on all parties in the Liberian conflict to respect civilians and refrain from violence against civilians, recruitment of child soldiers, and looting of civilian property. In addition, call on LURD to immediately release all abducted civilians and on both LURD and MODEL to permit civilians to freely depart areas of conflict for their safety.  Call on all parties in the Liberian conflict and neighboring governments to respect humanitarian aid workers and provide unfettered access to civilian populations in need of assistance and protection in Liberia, including through cross-line and cross-border operations from neighboring countries.  Provide any future intervention force in Liberia with Chapter VII peace enforcement authorization to protect civilians.  Revise and strengthen the mandate of the U.N. Peace-Building Support Office in Liberia (UNOL) to include human rights monitoring and investigation, public reporting, and the raising of individual cases of abuse with the Liberian authorities and the leadership of the rebel groups. Funding for these activities should come from the general funds of the U.N. rather than from donor contributions.  Express your condemnation of regional governments for their support to abusive insurgent groups and violations of existing sanctions on Liberia, and consider imposing secondary sanctions on regional governments found to be involved in the Liberian war.     Côte d'Ivoire: On the Precipice  The eight-month-old war in the Côte d'Ivoire has revealed deep divisions in Ivorian society and produced numerous serious abuses against civilians, some of which amount to war crimes. Western Côte d'Ivoire has been the site of a virtual proxy war by Liberian forces, demonstrating the easy spillover potential of the Liberian conflict. As was the pattern by all sides in Liberia, armed groups have targeted civilians for abuse, and looting has been a primary objective. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread abuses by both government and rebel-allied fighters in the west. Executions, sexual violence, forced labor and systematic looting of property have been commonplace, abuses that echo the treatment of civilians in Liberia.   The recent ceasefire in the west, and the formation of the government of reconciliation, are steps in the right direction, but the Ivorian peace process remains extremely fragile. There is an urgent need for the parties to the conflict, the United Nations and member states to reinforce these positive steps with further concrete action, both within Côte d'Ivoire and in neighboring Liberia. Parts of the country, particularly along the Liberian border, remain volatile, demonstrating the degree to which the Liberian and Ivorian conflicts are interlinked. Impunity-both past and present, Ivorian and regional-remains a key concern that must be addressed if a stable Côte d'Ivoire is to emerge from the past months of conflict. Efforts must be made to bridge the social divisions created by years of manipulation of ethnic and political tensions.   Abuses committed by the government and government-allied forces include: reprisal killings by state security forces based on the ethnic, national, religious or political affiliations of individuals; indiscriminate attacks on civilians by helicopter gunships; killings, rapes, and other acts of violence against civilians committed by Liberians recruited by the Ivorian government in refugee camps and from the Liberian MODEL rebel group; and attacks on northern Ivorians and immigrant civilians by civilian militias encouraged by and sometimes working in complicity with government in and around Duékoué, Daloa, Toulepleu and Tabou.   Abuses by the """"Forces Nouvelles""""[1] rebel groups and allied Liberian fighters include: summary executions of dozens of government officials, suspected government sympathizers and members of civilian militias by Ivorian rebel troops; systematic looting, summary executions and other acts of violence against civilians by Liberian fighters allied to the MPIGO rebel group; and sexual violence against girls and women in the west, including rape and sexual slavery.   Refugees and immigrants have been particular targets in the Ivorian war. Liberian refugees, including children, have been subjected to forced recruitment and violence by state authorities and local communities in western Côte d'Ivoire. Immigrants, particularly Burkinabé, continue to suffer from widespread attacks that have in many instances been encouraged or tolerated by authorities. Efforts to relocate the refugee population and ensure protection for the immigrant population must be implemented without further delay.   It is vital that the cycle of impunity in Côte d'Ivoire, which is one of the causes of the recent conflict, is ended. There is an urgent need to ensure that abuses by all sides in the Ivorian conflict are fully investigated and that those responsible for abuses are brought to justice. The human rights monitoring component of the recently approved UN mission to Côte d'Ivoire, MINUCI, must be implemented immediately, with an extensive field presence, in order to deter further abuses, document past incidents, and contribute to the protection of civilians. In addition, outstanding issues that have contributed to the conflict, such as land and nationality disputes, must be addressed promptly. Adequate support from the United Nations and its member states will be required to assure a comprehensive and effective response to these complex issues.  Call on the government of Côte d'Ivoire to immediately cease recruitment of Liberian refugees; end support to civilian militias; and take immediate steps to ensure that attacks on Ivorian citizens and foreign nationals, particularly Burkinabé and Liberian refugees, are ended, particularly in Duékoué, Guiglo and around Daloa and Tabou.  Support the immediate implementation of the human rights monitoring component of MINUCI in Côte d'Ivoire, with appropriate human, financial and technical resources. The monitoring component should have the mandate to report on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law by all sides to the conflict, including Liberian combatants, and should make recommendations about mechanisms for holding perpetrators accountable. The monitoring mission should have as extensive a field presence as possible, including in Daloa, Bouaké, San Pedro, Duékoué and Man. The mission's reports should be made public.     Guinea   Responding to the regional crisis is incomplete without addressing Guinea's role as both the principal regional recipient of large numbers of refugees and a key supporter of the LURD. The government of Guinea fears attacks at its Liberian border, but continues to support the presence of LURD troops in the Liberian refugee camps, a presence that is now well-documented. Guinea has been complicit in abuses of Liberian refugees through its support to the LURD. This has been documented by Human Rights Watch and other organizations, including in the latest report of the U.N. Panel of Experts.[2] While Guinea is clearly in a fragile position-facing elections later this year, with an unstable economy, and with over 100,000 Sierra Leonean, Ivorian and Liberian refugees remaining on its territory -the government has an obligation to respect international human rights and humanitarian norms, and to respect the U.N. arms embargo on Liberia. Guinea, a Security Council member, should be warned to cease its support to LURD or face the possibility of sanctions.   It is essential that refugees are able to seek refuge in Guinea and that refugee camps retain a truly humanitarian character. A serious effort must be made to screen refugees at border transit posts using fair and efficient procedures. This requires that humanitarian agencies-especially UNHCR-are provided access to all border transit areas with incoming refugees and other displaced civilians, or alternatively, that refugees are swiftly transferred to secure locations where such screening can be conducted. In addition, UNHCR must be supported in its efforts to increase the levels of humanitarian assistance and protection of refugees, not only from sexual exploitation, but also from forced recruitment into armed groups, which are having a destabilizing effect through the region.  Sierra Leone  Sierra Leone has made significant progress over the past year. The decade-long civil war ended, and the state of emergency has been lifted. Last May, President Kabbah and his Sierra Leone People's Party were re-elected in elections that were largely peaceful, though there were a few reports of violence and intimidation. The seventeen thousand-strong peacekeeping force of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) completed disarmament of over forty-seven thousand combatants, contributing, with British-led efforts to significant improvement in prospects for peace and security. More than 220,000 Sierra Leonean refugees from Guinea, Liberia, and the broader sub-region have returned home. Two important transitional justice mechanisms aimed at ensuring accountability for the horrific abuses that characterized the war-the Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission-have begun operations.   Against these positive developments, the intensification of civil war in neighboring Liberia brought over 60,000 Liberian refugees to Sierra Leone, resulted in instability in the border areas, and drew in hundreds of Sierra Leonean former combatants to fight for both Liberian government and rebel forces. A similar pattern emerged in Côte d'Ivoire, where former combatants from Sierra Leone's war have been actively involved in fighting. The regional instability, continuing attacks along the border, and the fragility of the peace in Sierra Leone, should be taken into account in any assessment of the potential for further drawdown of the UNAMSIL forces.  The Sierra Leone Special Court    In March, the Sierra Leone Special Court's announcement of its first seven indictments was a tremendous step forward for the cause of justice in Sierra Leone. The Court announced indictments against Foday Saybana Sankoh, Johnny Paul Koroma, Sam Bockarie, Issa Hassan Sesay, Alex Tamba Brima, Morris Kallon and Sam Hinga Norman, and, in April, added an indictment against Augustine Gbao. The crimes alleged in the indictments include murder, rape, extermination, acts of terror, enslavement, looting and burning, sexual slavery, conscription of children into an armed force, and attacks on UNAMSIL peacekeepers and humanitarian assistance workers.   On June 4, the Special Court unsealed its March 2003 indictment against Liberian President Charles Taylor, who stands accused as one of those """"bearing the greatest responsibility"""" for war crimes (murder, taking hostages); crimes against humanity (extermination, rape, murder, sexual slavery); and other serious violations of international humanitarian law (use of child soldiers) in Sierra Leone. Sankoh, Sesay, Brima, Kallon, Norman and Gbao are in custody. Two indicted individuals and members of their families who might have been witnesses to the role of Charles Taylor have been killed in Liberia in the past six weeks. Bockarie and members of his family were reportedly killed by Liberian security forces in early May and Koroma was reportedly killed earlier this week in Liberia under circumstances that remain unclear.   The Council has already called on """"all States, in particular the Government of Liberia, to cooperate fully with the Special Court for Sierra Leone.""""[3] The Council should reiterate the demand that all states cooperate in the immediate arrest and transfer of all indicted individuals to the custody of the Special Court.  Call on all states you visit as well as others in the region-including Burkina Faso, Gambia, Ghana, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, and Togo-to commit to the safe return of all individuals indicted by the Special Court of Sierra Leone who flee into their territories, to assist in their apprehension, and to otherwise cooperate with the Special Court. Protection of Refugees, Internally Displaced Persons and ECOWAS Nationals   Thousands of refugees and internally displaced persons currently face bleak options in the West African sub-region. Many are faced with the unacceptable choice of remaining in conflict zones where they risk an array of atrocities by abusive armed forces, or seeking refuge in camps where again, they may be subjected to forced recruitment and abuses by governments and abusive insurgencies alike. For some individuals, it devolves into a choice between conflict zones, as it has for many of the Ivorian, Liberian and ECOWAS nationals who fled into Liberia from Côte d'Ivoire in the past five months.   Prior to the February upsurge in fighting between the government and rebel forces in Liberia, thousands of civilians were receiving temporary assistance in refugee camps, transit centers and among host communities in Liberia's Grand Gedeh, Maryland and Nimba counties, all of which border Côte d'Ivoire. This group included at least 3,000 Ivorian refugees and more than 5,000 Burkinabé and other ECOWAS nationals, many of whom had fled Côte d'Ivoire for Liberia in December 2002, and some of whom urgently required protection in Liberia.   Due to the upsurge in fighting in and around Zwedru and Toe town at the end of February, most of these people were dispersed into the bush in eastern Liberia. Some have returned to a hostile environment in Côte d'Ivoire. To date, many are unaccounted for due to the lack of humanitarian access. This development raises several concerns regarding the assistance and protection provided to civilians in the region. For one, Guinea's refusal to allow entry to many of the ECOWAS nationals clearly contributed to their remaining in unsafe conditions in Liberia. In December 2002, some Burkinabé individuals were refouled by Guinean authorities after they attempted to enter Guinea amidst a convoy of Malians. The failure to either put sufficient pressure on Guinea to admit refugees or to ensure their protection in Liberia, despite clear signs of increasing conflict by January 2003, speaks of a weak humanitarian framework in Liberia.   The humanitarian situation of ECOWAS nationals from the region, in particular large numbers of Burkinabé who were residing and working in Côte d'Ivoire prior to the war, provides an additional example of the failure of the current system to adequately protect and assist civilians in need in the region. Thousands of Burkinabé were forced to flee their homes in western Côte d'Ivoire in December 2002. Most lost all their possessions due to looting and their urgent flight from their homes. Many who fled west became trapped in Liberia. Others managed to reach Guinea, only to find that because they were not deemed to be refugees, they could not benefit from the assistance and the protection of the UNHCR.   Liberia presents a situation where effective protection and assistance to refugees is inextricably linked to the provision of effective protection and assistance to internally displaced persons. Given the constant insecurity threatening these populations, today's internally displaced person is tomorrow's refugee, and vice-versa. Ending these cycles of displacement and refoulement should be a priority of the Security Council. The only way it can be sufficiently addressed is to address the overall causes and patterns of regional instability and human rights abuses and to ensure that once displaced, adequate humanitarian assistance and protection are in place to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable civilians by abusive governments and insurgent groups.   In the course of your visit to the region, the Security Council should consider additional ways of strengthening the humanitarian framework in Liberia, but also in Guinea and Côte d'Ivoire. Deployment of human rights monitors and international observers at key border points would help deter abuses.  Call on all your interlocutors to respect international human rights and humanitarian law, particularly regarding treatment of civilians and other non-combatants, and recruitment of child soldiers, and to hold accountable those members of their forces responsible for abuses.  Ensure that adequate protection and assistance reaches all internally displaced persons and refugees in the region, including ECOWAS nationals present in Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire, including via cross-border operations from neighboring countries, if necessary.  Explore the possibility of the placement of international military observers and human rights monitors along the Sierra Leonean/Guinean, Guinean/Liberian, and Ivorian/Liberian borders to monitor and investigate cross-border attacks.  Child Soldiers   Over the past year there has been continuing recruitment of children by government and rebel groups in Liberian displaced and refugee camps, and fresh reports of recruitment of child soldiers by both rebel and government forces in Côte d'Ivoire. A particularly worrying development has been the recruitment of Liberian refugees, including children, by government-allied groups in Nicla refugee camp in western Côte d'Ivoire and in Liberian refugee camps in Ghana.   Human Rights Watch gathered accounts of children among the Liberian fighters in Côte d'Ivoire, some of whom are as young as nine and according to one description, """"cannot even control the weight of their guns."""" The continuing use of child recruits is also noted in recent reports from Liberia.   Security Council Resolution 1460 committed the United Nations to enter into dialogue with parties to armed conflict that are recruiting or using child soldiers in order to develop """"clear and time bound action plans to end the practice.""""[4] In that resolution, the Security Council also called on parties to armed conflict identified in an annex to the Secretary General's report of November 26, 2002, """"to provide information on steps they have taken to end the recruitment or use of child soldiers."""" Parties to armed conflict in five countries were named in this annex for violating their international obligations regarding the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Among them were the government of Liberia and the LURD.   Human Rights Watch therefore urges the Security Council to use the upcoming trip to West Africa to take steps to engage the governments of Liberia, Guinea, and Côte d'Ivoire on the above practices, in accordance with Resolution 1460, and call on all Liberian and Ivorian insurgent groups to refrain from recruiting children and immediately demobilize existing child soldiers. The Security Council should remind the government of Liberia and the LURD of their obligations under Resolution 1460 to report on the steps that they have taken to halt their recruitment or use of child soldiers in violation of international obligations, and the Security Council's intention to consider appropriate further steps if it deems that insufficient progress is made in this regard, after evaluating the Secretary General's next report on this issue, which is due by October 31, 2003.   As part of the Secretary General's next report on children and armed conflict, the Security Council has requested a progress report regarding parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of their international obligations, in accordance with Resolution 1379. In view of this request, the Security Council should also consider ways to enhance reporting and monitoring of this issue in the region.  Use of Proxy Forces and Support to Militias   One of the alarming developments in the region, reflected in particular by the evolution of the conflict in western Côte d'Ivoire, has been the recruitment and use of foreign fighters and civilian militias by both rebel and government forces. In addition to the government's use of mercenaries from other African countries, both the government and rebel forces used hundreds of Liberian fighters and members of civilian militias in their efforts to control the west. Some of these fighters were implicated in serious human rights abuses in previous wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone, including former RUF fighters such as recently deceased Sam Bockarie, who was indicted by the Sierra Leone Special Court for war crimes.   Human Rights Watch interviewed civilians who fled Danane, Zouan-Hounien, Toulepleu, Blolékin and other towns and villages controlled by government and rebel groups in Côte d'Ivoire in the past few months. Victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch consistently stated that English-speaking Liberians were responsible for systematic looting of civilian property, accompanied by assault and, in some cases, executions of civilians and the rape of women and girls. In addition, Human Rights Watch received reports that while Liberian fighters were clearly linked to Ivorian rebel and government forces, and in some cases were recruited on the understanding that they would be paid, they rarely received any formal salary. Instead, whether through inadequate capacity or willingness to control these fighters, they appear to have been accorded a virtual license to enrich themselves through looting of civilian property.   Finally, the continuing use of civilian militias sponsored by regional governments, represents an alarming trend that must be addressed. The forced and voluntary recruitment of civilians into ill-trained, armed militias by the Liberian government and rebel groups is an ongoing concern in that it contributes to the proliferation of abuses by armed forces in the region. The extension of this trend to Côte d'Ivoire, where the activities of rural civilian self-defense committees have resulted in serious abuses of human rights, is highly alarming.  Extend and broaden the mandate of the U.N. Panel of Experts to investigate regional financing and support to abusive armed groups, and consider extending the sanctions regime against those governments who participate in this practice.  Circulation of Arms  The inflow and circulation of arms, particularly small arms and light weapons, in the region has clearly contributed to the increased conflict and abuses against civilians by governments and armed groups. It also has facilitated the formation of new armed groups and the use of ill-disciplined fighters, including mercenaries.   The recent report of the U.N. Panel of Experts on Liberia documented continuing violations of the arms embargo on Liberia and noted that the support of regional governments such as Guinea to Liberian insurgent groups constitutes a violation of the sanctions regime. The Liberian government recently acknowledged importing huge quantities of small arms and light weapons, and the list of imported weapons it provided the Panel closely match those documented to have been illegally delivered from Serbia and Montenegro in six shipments in 2002; the Liberian government did not admit to earlier illicit arms purchases, which have also been documented. The Panel also described numerous suspected actual or attempted arms shipments to Liberia in recent months, including a possible ongoing scheme to export weapons to Liberia on the basis of a Democratic Republic of Congo end-user certificate, and the import of illegal weapons shipments to Liberia via Burkina Faso.   In addition, abusive insurgents throughout West Africa have been able to obtain arms and other military support with apparent ease. The Panel describes Guinea as a supply route for arms to the LURD, as noted, and points out that it has some evidence Côte d'Ivoire is supporting MODEL. The use of unaccountable mercenaries and untrained civilian militias, including in Côte d'Ivoire, is troubling, particularly as many of those recruited, including ex-RUF, are known to have an atrocious human rights record.   Human Rights urges the members of the Security Council to consistently condemn all regional governments that violate the sanctions regime on Liberia or support abusive forces. Accordingly, the Security Council should extend and broaden the mandate of the U.N. Panel of Experts to investigate regional financing and support to abusive armed groups, and consider imposing secondary sanctions against those governments who participate in this practice. The Security Council also should press for accountability for embargo violations, including by calling on U.N. member states to enact national laws that implement U.N. arms embargoes and by promoting and monitoring national efforts to investigate and prosecute sanctions-violators.   In addition, strengthening of the EWOWAS small arms moratorium is needed. Specifically, it should be expanded to encompass all weapons categories, developed into an information-exchange mechanism, and made binding. Further efforts are needed to ensure that arms exporters comply with the moratorium, which could be facilitated through full participation in the proposed information exchange.  Promote measures to address the uncontrolled spread of weapons in the sub-region and continued embargo violations, such as through the strengthening of the ECOWAS small arms moratorium, and the prosecution of sanctions violators.

The Russian president is to arrive in London June 24 for a three-day state visit. In an open letter to the British prime minister, Human Rights Watch called for Blair to press for an end to abuses and to ensure accountability for those implicated in rights violations. Recent Human Rights Watch research and Russian government statistics show that the situation in Chechnya is steadily worsening, with some 60 people being “disappeared” every month. Russian officials have also recently admitted the existence of forty-nine mass graves, containing the remains of almost 3,000 people. In its letter, Human Rights Watch notes the strong position taken by the United Kingdom at the recent United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, in support of a resolution on Chechnya. That resolution, if passed, would have pressed for accountability and demanded access for U.N. monitors, including the U.N. rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial killings. But the letter also notes the apparent contradictions in Blair’s own stance. In St. Petersburg this month, Blair spoke favourably of a recent referendum on the future of Chechnya, despite the atrocious circumstances—widespread arbitrary detention, daily disappearances, and an overall atmosphere of impunity—in which the referendum was held and in which ordinary Chechens continue to live. “Conflicting messages on Chechnya expose the prime minister to charges of inconsistency and hypocrisy,” said Steve Crawshaw, London director of Human Rights Watch. “It is absurd for the British government to criticise Russian behaviour in Chechnya in one forum, and then for Blair to praise Putin when the two men meet face to face.” In a parliamentary debate on Chechnya on June 18, Europe minister Denis MacShane appeared evasive when pressed as to whether the prime minister would even raise the issue of Chechnya in his meetings with the Russian president. Blair later told the House of Commons that he would mention Chechnya in his talks. In the same sentence, however, he emphasised: “It's also important that we support Russia in her action against terrorism.” Human Rights Watch has repeatedly condemned unlawful acts by Chechen rebels, including the Moscow theatre siege last year and a number of attacks on the pro-Moscow civilian administration in Chechnya. But Human Rights Watch argued that the British government fails to make an important connection – that the lack of accountability for the widespread abuses in Chechnya does nothing to make Russia a safer place. “Blair played such a key role in making the Northern Ireland peace agreement happen, he of all people should not fail to understand this basic point,” said Crawshaw. “Repression and lack of accountability do not help stability, but rather make things worse. Blair must make that point clearly when he meets Putin. Failure to do so sends a message as well.”","Europe/Central Asia, Russia, United Kingdom",""

In an open letter to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Human Rights Watch called for an independent commission of inquiry to determine who is responsible for the attacks.

In a memorandum sent to donor governments in advance of the meeting, Human Rights Watch highlighted priorities for assistance, including the development of human rights institutions; security sector and judicial reform; the reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons; protections for women and children; and the clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnance. """"Lesson number one from Afghanistan is that, without security, there will be no reconstruction,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.

Help will also be needed to restore the basic infrastructure for law enforcement and justice. In visits to eight open Baghdad police stations, Human Rights Watch found that all had been completely stripped of all essential equipment, including archives, and even light fixtures and wiring. """"Protection of human rights as well as law and order are indispensable for development and reconstruction,"""" said Mungoven. """"Donors should help Iraq establish a national human rights commission or ombudsman's office to investigate complaints and prevent abuse."""" Human Rights Watch called on donors to help with the development of a proper legal and administrative framework for the reintegration of displaced Iraqis and returning refugees, including the establishment of a tribunal to resolve property disputes that could be the source of violence and reprisals. Human Rights Watch also called for special priority to be given to the needs of women and children who have suffered the cumulative effects of sanctions and war.

If I could summarize my views in one sentence it would be this: The conduct of the Burmese government is beyond the pale, but the situation in Burma is not beyond our capacity to influence, so long as the United States and its partners around the world act in concert and in time. We are here today, of course, primarily because of the attack on Aung San Suu Kyi and her party on May 30th. Because the Burmese government makes it virtually impossible to conduct independent investigations of incidents such as this, there is much we do not know, including the precise number of people who were killed that night. But there is much we can say to piece together what happened, from eyewitness testimony and from diplomatic sources in Rangoon -- especially the U.S. embassy, which, to its credit, sent staff to the scene of the attack.  We know that Aung San Suu Kyi had been traveling through northern and central Burma gathering large crowds at every stop, urging dialogue with the government and a peaceful transition to democracy. This evidence of her continued popularity unsettled a regime that is deeply insecure about its own survival. We know that at many of these stops, her supporters were harassed by members of the Union Solidarity Development Association, a government-created organization that has increasingly taken on a paramilitary character (and which has aptly been described as the """"Fedayeen of Burma"""").  Every independent observer agrees that on the evening of May 30th, Suu Kyi's party was attacked by armed thugs associated with the USDA. According to some eyewitnesses, police were present, as were common criminals released from prison for the purpose of taking part in the attack. As the State Department has put it, this was a premeditated ambush. The Burmese government has admitted to four deaths; others have reported many more. U.S. embassy staff found evidence at the scene of significant violence. Given the Burmese military's role in creating and guiding the USDA, it is fair to conclude that the country's leadership ordered the attack, and to hold it politically and criminally accountable for the deaths of unarmed members of Suu Kyi's party.  We also know, of course, that Aung San Suu Kyi was detained by the military following the attack along with a large number - we do not know precisely how many - of her party officials and supporters. The military claims she is being held under """"protective custody."""" That is, of course, a surreal and Orwellian claim, since clearly, the only people Suu Kyi needs to be protected from are the people who have taken her into custody. According to U.N. envoy Ismail Razali, the only outsider who has seen her, she is in fact being held under Article 10a of the Burmese criminal code, which permits the state to detain anyone it considers a security risk for up to five years without charge or trial.  I believe we should be even more concerned about the fate of the others who were arrested with Aung San Suu Kyi on and since May 30th. These men and women do not enjoy the relative protection from torture that comes with her prominence. The latest reports I've received suggest that the International Committee for the Red Cross will be given access to some of these detainees - although, significantly, the ICRC was yesterday denied access to Aung San Suu Kyi herself. But of course we cannot be certain that the ICRC will be given a full accounting of all detainees. Nor is there any way yet to confirm disturbing reports that eyewitnesses to the attack may have been silenced by the military by intimidation or far worse. The only protection these people really have is our determination to remember this incident and to hold those responsible accountable.  Quite rightly, governments around the world have condemned the attack on Suu Kyi and her party and demanded her immediate release. The Bush administration moved swiftly to mobilize a broad international response, including this week's unprecedented appeal to Burma from its neighbors in ASEAN. But there is a danger here, Mr. Chairman. If Suu Kyi is indeed released, the world may breathe a sigh of relief and say mission accomplished. Attention will turn elsewhere. Pressure on the Burmese government will ease. That is why we cannot confuse a return to the status quo of just last month with progress. We must press for an end to human rights abuses, the release of all detainees, and a resumption of a political dialogue in Burma that will lead to fundamental change.  The Burmese government has played this game before. It arrests Suu Kyi. A crisis ensues. It releases her. The illusion of progress is achieved. But the people of Burma continue to suffer. UN envoy Razali has had to expend much of his time and political capital negotiating Suu Kyi's release over the last several years, instead of pursuing his true objective - brokering negotiations leading to a genuine political settlement. In recent days, he has rightly urged the international community to maintain its focus on that goal.  This struggle is about much, much more than freedom for Suu Kyi and her political party. In fact, that is not at all what Suu Kyi herself has been sacrificing for all these years. It is about establishing the rule of law and respect for human rights for all the people of Burma. Those rights were systematically denied before May 30th and continue to be denied today.  The government continues to hold more than 1,300 political prisoners, including elected members of parliament. Though some 500 have been released since intermittent talks between the government and the NLD began in 2000, Burmese citizens have continued to be arrested and sentenced to long prison terms for the peaceful expression of their views. Torture of detainees is common; last year, the State Department reported at least three deaths in custody of political prisoners.  The military continues to use forced labor on a large scale. Villagers are compelled to work without pay on infrastructure and agricultural projects, as porters in army camps, and on the construction of temples. Children as young as seven are forced in many parts of the country to carry army supplies and to work on construction sites. In effect, Burma maintains the crudest form of command economy: When the military wants something built, it simply commands people to build it.  Perhaps the most horrific of the military's abuses are committed against civilians living in the country's ethnic minority areas. In recent years, the military has pursued a strategy of forcibly relocating minority villages in areas where ethnic activists and rebels are active, and in areas targeted for economic development and tourism. In the Shan and Karen states in particular, these relocations clearly amount to a campaign of ethnic cleansing. They have produced hundreds of thousands of refugees and a million internally displaced persons. Burmese troops have burned villages, hospitals and schools in ethnic areas, conscripted villagers to perform forced labor, and executed suspected opponents of the regime. Shan human rights organizations have amply documented, and the State Department has confirmed, the systematic rape of women and girls in the Shan State by the Burmese military. Most of the documented rapes were committed by officers in front of their troops; a quarter resulted in death.  Last year, Human Rights Watch published a report on another tragic feature of this campaign of repression: the forced recruitment by the Burmese military of thousands of child soldiers, some as young as eleven. The Burmese military has a higher percentage of child soldiers than any military in the world - some 70,000 of its 350,000 man force may be children. These children are brutalized during training and forced to commit the worst abuses - including beatings, executions and massacres of civilians.  What can outsiders do to encourage an end to these abuses and meaningful political change in Burma?  Some believe the answer is very little, or even nothing at all. They point out that years of pressure from the United States and others have not eased repression in Burma.  I think it is true that change in Burma can only come from within. But I also think it is undeniable that pressure from the outside, including sanctions, has made a tangible difference. No, it has not brought democratic change. But without it, there is no question in my mind that Aung San Suu Kyi and her leading supporters would have been exiled, imprisoned, or killed years ago and her political movement shut down entirely. The Red Cross would not be in Burma visiting prisoners. U.N. envoy Razali would never have gotten in the door in Rangoon to begin work on a political settlement. In other words, international pressure has kept hope alive in Burma. Without it, there would be no hope.  I also agree with those who say that the Burmese government must feel pressure from many countries, not just one, before it can be convinced to compromise. But experience shows that multilateral pressure can best be mobilized if the United States is willing to lead. That's why I applaud President Bush for acting swiftly following the attack on Suu Kyi to expand the visa ban against Burmese officials and to freeze their assets.  The Senate also acted swiftly last week, approving by a vote of 97-1 legislation to ban Burmese imports to the United States. Though this appears on its face to be a broad economic sanction, I would argue that in the unique case of Burma, an import ban is a sanction that effectively and rather narrowly targets the leadership of the country. The vast majority of Burmese exports to the United States are garments produced in factories wholly or partly owned by the regime - and approximately a quarter of Burmese exports now go to the United States.  I hope the House of Representatives will act quickly as well, so that this legislation it can become law. That's what Congressman Lantos and Chairman Hyde have called for, and I urge all members to support them. You should not wait and see what happens in Burma. Indeed, you should recognize that it is the Burmese government that is now waiting to see what happens in the U.S. Congress. It will notice if you impose a price for its recent actions. It will just as surely notice if you do not act, and it will draw the appropriate conclusion either way.  Of course, it is also vital to mobilize the broadest possible international coalition for human rights in Burma. The EU has taken important steps already. This week's ASEAN statement was also a step forward, but also clearly not enough. Ambassador Razali has been pressing Burma's southeast Asian neighbors to abandon their traditional policy of non-interference in Burma's affairs. Interestingly, in a recent interview, he singled out Singapore as a country with important influence in Burma, both as a trading partner and as the country where Burma's leaders apparently keep their money. I would urge the Congress to ask some hard questions about Singapore's role when the administration sends the U.S.-Singapore Free Trade Agreement to the Hill.  It will also be vital to raise the profile of this issue in the United Nations. First of all, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Burma, Paulo Pinerho, should be urged to open an investigation into the events of May 30th. The Burmese government may or may not cooperate with such an investigation, but either way, it should know that the international community is not going to forget what happened.  Second, the United States and its partners should begin to explore the possibility of a Security Council resolution on Burma that would demand a return to dialogue and compel all nations to take concrete steps to press the regime. Given the depth of international outrage over the recent crackdown in Burma, I believe such a resolution can now realistically be pursued. This is, by the way, a key recommendation of a Council on Foreign Relations report on Burma released yesterday. More significantly, it is something that Ambassador Razali, in his role as UN envoy on Burma, has now urged, arguing that the prospect of Security Council action is something the Burmese government will stand up and notice above all else.  Perhaps most important, we need to maintain the intense focus on Burma that the recent crackdown has made possible. One of the advantages that the generals who rule Burma have over their critics in other countries is that the generals wake up every morning and worry about how to avoid change. Given all the world's many problems, it's hard for most of us to worry each day about how to promote change in this one country. In a sense, it isn't easy for us to match their dedication. But we have to do our best and try.  In just the last two weeks, tremendous progress has been made in mobilizing an effective and truly international effort to defend the rights of the Burmese people. This momentum must be sustained, not squandered. I hope the Congress will do its part to keep the spotlight on Burma bright and pressure on its government strong.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

During a visit to Saudi Arabia in January 2003, senior Saudi government officials told a Human Rights Watch delegation that reforms were on the way, including new procedures in the criminal justice system, restraints on 4,500 state-paid religious police, and the formation of an independent human rights organization. Saudi officials did not indicate any plans to lift severe restrictions on the rights of women, guarantee religious freedom for Muslims and non-Muslims, or end punitive sanctions on perceived government critics, such as confiscation of passports and dismissal from jobs. Human Rights Watch said that to date, the pledged reforms have largely not materialized, citing the example of a recent press crackdown. On May 27, prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi, editor in chief of the reformist al-Watan, was summarily dismissed from his post. Journalists at the privately-owned daily said the manager fired Khashoggi, but was carrying out a decision of the information ministry, the Associated Press reported on May 28. In Saudi Arabia, the information ministry controls the hiring and firing of top editors. Al-Watan had maintained a critical view of the kingdom's conservative religious establishment, including the religious police. Following the suicide bombings in Riyadh on May 12, Khashoggi assigned blame beyond the perpetrators of the attacks. """"Those who committed yesterday's crime, which will have a painful impact on the peaceful nature of our nation, are not only the suicide terrorists, but also everyone who instigated or justified the attacks, everyone who called them mujahideen, even everyone who kept silent on this direction, which is deviating from our religion and nature, or tried to find excuses for it,"""" he wrote in his column. The firing of Khashoggi came shortly after the government authorized the creation of a journalists association, one of several highly touted reforms. Top editors held a first meeting in March 2003 and announced that the association's goals included """"improving the standards of the profession, organizing its activities, and protecting the rights of the journalists,"""" the Saudi daily Arab News reported on May 26. """"Reforms on paper do not amount to much if the government's practices remain unchanged,"""" said Megally. """"Allowing journalists to organize is a positive development, but not if it is accompanied by continued intimidation of independent members of the profession."""" Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the pace of legal reforms, including implementation of the kingdom's new criminal procedure code, which became law in May 2002. The code guarantees defendants the right to a lawyer during investigation and trial, and contains provisions to bring greater transparency to the criminal justice system, but it is unclear how the code is being implemented in practice. Of particular concern are thousands of men and women migrant workers who are currently imprisoned throughout the country, have little understanding of their rights in the justice system, and no effective access to legal assistance. Human Rights Watch said that, as part of its public relations outreach efforts, the Saudi government should articulate clearly to a U.S. and international audience the steps that are being taken to change practices that restrict fundamental human rights. Human Rights Watch called on Crown Prince Abdullah and other senior officials to make public commitments to: End harassment of journalists and writers, and guarantee freedom of expression Afford all residents of the kingdom the right to freedom of association without government control or interference Permit the establishment of independent women's rights organizations Allow domestic and international human rights monitoring of the criminal justice system, particularly cases of individuals who have been sentenced to death or are facing the death penalty or limb amputation (Human Rights Watch opposes in all circumstances the death penalty and limb amputation as inherently cruel) Guarantee religious freedom to everyone in the kingdom, and remedy discrimination based on religious belief Afford greater protection to migrant workers by endorsing the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families and implementing its provisions","Middle East/North Africa, Saudi Arabia",""

The refugees will have just fifteen days to appeal their categorization in a screening process that the two governments have been conducting since March 2001.   In a joint statement, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Lutheran World Federation, Refugees International, the U.S. Committee for Refugees, and the Bhutanese Refugee Support Group, called on donor governments and governments in the region to increase pressure on the governments of Bhutan and Nepal to find a just and fair solution to this long-standing refugee crisis.   """"The Bhutanese refugees have been waiting over a decade for a solution to their plight,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Human Rights Watch's refugee policy advisor. """"This is not a solution, but rather a wholesale violation of their rights.""""   Nepal and Bhutan today issued the results of a pilot verification process in one camp that divided the 12,000 refugees into four categories:   Two and a half percent of the refugees (only 293 people) in Category I: bona fide Bhutanese citizens who would be eligible for repatriation to Bhutan;  Seventy percent in Category II: refugees who """"voluntarily emigrated"""" from Bhutan and would be required to reapply for Bhutanese citizenship. The process they would need to follow to reclaim their citizenship, land and property remains unclear and may be decided in talks between the governments in August; Twenty-four percent in Category III: non-Bhutanese people whose claims to citizenship were rejected and would be returned to their respective countries; Three percent in Category IV: so-called """"criminals"""" who would be liable to be tried in the Bhutanese courts.   More than 100,000 refugees of ethnic Nepalese origin from southern Bhutan have been living in camps in southeast Nepal for a dozen years after they were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality and forced to flee Bhutan in the early 1990s. The Bhutanese refugee situation has become one of the most protracted and neglected refugee crises in the world.   """"This decision sends a message to other governments that it is legally acceptable to arbitrarily deprive a whole ethnic group of their nationality, expel them from their country, and then refuse to accept them back,"""" said Ingrid Massage, interim director of the Asia and Pacific program at Amnesty International. """"Bhutan's donors should not rubber-stamp a process that could render tens of thousands stateless.""""   The nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) criticized the length of time it has taken for the two governments to complete the verification process in Khudunabari camp, and the absence of any transparency or international monitoring. Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has been administering the Bhutanese refugee camps since the start of the crisis in 1991, it has been systematically excluded by both governments from playing any role in the status determination and repatriation process.   The NGOs criticized the findings of the verification and argued that the four categories were seriously flawed. Refugees whose claims to Bhutanese citizenship were rejected may have been arbitrarily stripped of their nationality before they were forced out of Bhutan due to the discriminatory nature and application of Bhutan's citizenship laws. Furthermore, many of those refugees classified as having voluntarily emigrated from Bhutan were in fact forced into signing """"voluntary migration"""" certificates before they were expelled from the country. Finally, refugees found to be """"criminals"""" in the categorization process were likely to have been pro-democracy political activists who risked facing unfair trials and lack of due process protections if they were returned to Bhutan.   The NGOs argued that the Bhutanese refugees should have access to a full, fair and impartial appeal process with sufficient time to prepare their case and with access to independent advice. At present, they will have only fifteen days to appeal their categorization to the same adjudicators, and only on the basis of new documentary evidence. The NGOs expressed serious concern that the large number of refugees forced to reapply for their citizenship would face severe obstacles due to Bhutan's burdensome citizenship requirements and the arbitrary provisions of its citizenship laws.   The NGOs called on donor governments and governments in the region to increase pressure on the governments of Bhutan and Nepal to:  Invite UNHCR to help facilitate and monitor the verification and repatriation process; Create a fair and independent appeal process with sufficient time for refugees to present their appeal to an impartial third party; Uphold the rights of Bhutanese refugees, including the right to return to their own country and the right not to be rendered stateless. """"The world has neglected the Bhutanese refugees for far too long,"""" said Peter Prove, Assistant to the General Secretary of the Lutheran World Federation. """"The governments of Bhutan and Nepal have failed to deliver a workable solution. The international community must now intervene and demand that the rights of the refugees are upheld.""""","Asia, Bhutan, Nepal",""

Thank you for allowing me to testify today.  I want to take this opportunity to tell you about the latest research Human Rights Watch has conducted in Afghanistan, in the last six months, research in provinces across Afghanistan, based on hundreds of interviews with ordinary Afghans-farmers, teachers, laborers, doctors, aid workers, women and men. The results of this research will be published in a report to be released in July 2003, but I will describe many of our core findings here. We don't have good news.  Human Rights Watch believes that human rights conditions in Afghanistan-which of course had improved dramatically with the collapse of the Taliban-are now in a state of deterioration.  Our most recent research shows that, in many districts and villages in Afghanistan today, families are now living in a constant state of fear. Most of the country is in the hands of warlords and gunmen-fighters in Afghanistan's past wars-who are now terrorizing local populations under their authority, robbing houses at night, stealing valuables, killing people, raping young women and girls, raping boys, seizing land from farmers, extorting money, and kidnapping young men and holding them until their families can pay a ransom. The situation is of course different in each district, but in almost every district Human Rights Watch has visited in the last six months, we have heard complaints about some or all of these types of abuses.  I have interviewed numerous families myself who have been robbed in the night by Afghan military troops or police, and listened to witnesses describe being beaten by troops, and begging for mercy.  But sadly there is more: our research has also uncovered cases of Afghan military commanders and officials-including high-level Afghan government officials-threatening and arresting journalists and political organizers, and beating or even torturing perceived opponents. I have interviewed myself several people who were tortured by Afghan government security forces, for organizing dissident political parties or groups. My colleagues have interviewed women who have been threatened with death for advocating women's rights.  Of course, these abuses are bad enough on their own, but their consequences for Afghanistan's future are even worse.  In many areas, Afghan civil society organizers, political organizers, and women's rights activists are now terrified of the warlord-rule, which makes it impossible for them to speak or organize openly. Many political organizers are now operating in secret. Journalists, in Kabul and elsewhere, are censoring themselves. The situation, to put it mildly, does not bode well for Afghanistan's upcoming constitutional loya jirga or elections in 2004.  The continuing instability is also keeping many refugees in Iran and Pakistan from returning home. We talked to many returned refugees, who were stuck in Kabul city, unable to return to the more dangerous rural areas. """"We wish we had stayed in Pakistan,"""" some of them said.  The worst consequence by far, however, has been the effect of the insecurity on the lives of women and girls.  Here in the United States, administration officials, and the President himself, have repeatedly said that Afghanistan has been liberated, and noted that girls have gone back to school.  The reality is more sobering. In many areas of Afghanistan today, insecurity is in fact forcing women and girls to stay indoors, and is depriving them of the opportunity to attend schools, go to work, or even seek health care at clinics and hospitals. We talked to countless families who affirmed this.  Today, the U.N. estimates that only thirty-two percent of school children in Afghanistan are girls. Population statistics in Afghanistan are always somewhat hit or miss, but under even the most conservative government estimates, it is clear that the majority of school-age girls in Afghanistan are not attending school. UNICEF estimates that in some provinces, the attendance rate for girls is as low as three percent.  Why are girls not in school? Some people think there is a """"cultural"""" reason, having to do with entrenched Islamic conservatism. Our research does not support such a conclusion.  Instead, the reasons in many cases seem to be security-based. In many provinces, especially around Kabul, Afghan families tell us that they aren't letting their daughters go to school because they fear they will be assaulted by gunmen on the way, kidnapped or raped. Many say that they want to send their daughters to school, but cannot, because of insecurity.  Let me be clear about what we are talking about with all of these abuses: We are not talking about crime here, we're talking about human rights abuses by government forces: warlords and gunmen who ostensibly work for the Afghan government. We are talking about abuses by the leftover militias of the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban forces, the irregular military forces who work in some areas with the United State military, and the current police forces made up of former military personnel. These forces were the allies of the United States in its war against the Taliban regime, and were armed, assisted, and enabled by the U.S. government.  These words we use -""""warlords"""" and """"warlordism""""- are not mine but those of Afghans themselves. They are Persian and Pashto words, translated into English: in Persian, the words jang salar, warlords; tufangdar, gunmen (topakyan in Pashto); jang salari, or jang salarism, warlordism, the rule of the gun. These are the words Afghans themselves are using to describe those who terrorize them.  And this is the vocabulary of Afghanistan today. This is the result of the Taliban's totalitarianism being replaced by the violence and cruelty of unfettered warlordism.  Recommendations You have heard from other witnesses today about the need for increased peacekeeping outside of Kabul, for more U.S. involvement in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former fighters (including a better vetting procedure, to sideline those with abusive pasts), and the need for funding for policing forces. Human Rights Watch seconds all of these recommendations. We also think that the U.S. should insist that the United Nations increase its human rights monitoring efforts.  But we would add that there is also a need for the U.S., and all other nations involved in Afghanistan, to cut off support for the warlords themselves. We urge specifically the Department of Defense, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Central Intelligence Agency-all of whom are cooperating with local military leaders in Afghanistan-to take better steps to avoid strengthening local military leaders.  As it stands, the United States has a split strategy in Afghanistan-supporting Hamid Karzai on the one hand, but cooperating with local warlords to hunt former Taliban on the other. Indeed, U.S. officials have for the most part just stood by and allowed local military leaders to seize control of local governmental offices-not only military bases, but health departments, trash collection offices, transportation ministry officers, and so on. This is not a good policy. Oftentimes, it seems that U.S. military and intelligence officials have assumed that, because Afghan forces are helping them, these forces are good and honorable people. This is an untenable view.  One last point: At some time in the future, the situation in Afghanistan could very well explode. When that happens, it is more than likely that most people in the world will not blame the United Nations, or the people of Afghanistan. They will, however, blame the United States-which has been involved in Afghanistan's internal affairs for almost a quarter century.  It is vitally important for the U.S. administration to take action now to avoid such an outcome, and we strongly urge all of the members of this committee to urge them to do so. The U.S. must give more support to President Karzai in his efforts to bring warlords under control, and make better efforts to cut off the warlords themselves.  I will end with the words of a displaced Afghan man from a rural area who told us he was unable to return to his home district because of the security problems there. He told me:  The gunmen, who have guns in their hands, are irresponsible forces. The United States, in a way, brought them to power, and it is these gunmen who create problems now for our people. These people must be disarmed. This is the foremost, most important step to be taken, immediately. Guns must only be given to those who have been trained. You must raise our voice to the United States, to disarm these people.  I very much hope I have done so today.  Thank you.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/06/17/press-freedom-morocco-set-back-journalist-jailing","Press Freedom in Morocco Set Back by Journalist Jailing","Press Freedom in Morocco Set Back by Journalist Jailing","","06/17/2003","The affirmation Tuesday of a 3-year prison term for journalist Ali Mrabet is a grave blow to press freedom in Morocco, Human Rights Watch said today. A Rabat appeals court upheld a lower court verdict that also banned the independent weeklies that Mrabet directs, Demain and its Arabic sister Douman. “With this unjust ruling, Morocco joins those countries in the region that imprison journalists,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa division. “Mrabet’s weeklies were among the brightest indicators of free expression in Morocco. They belong on the newsstands, and Mrabet belongs at his editorial desk, not in a prison cell.” Mrabet has been in prison since his May 21 lower-court conviction on charges of “insulting the king,” “undermining the monarchy, and “endangering the integrity of national territory” for articles, interviews and cartoons that appeared in the two Casablanca-based publications. The appeals court reduced his prison term from four to three years but left in force a fine of 20,000 dirhams (about U.S. $2,168). Mrabet began a hunger strike on May 6 to protest the government action against him and against his printer. He has been hospitalized since May 26 due to his hunger strike and did not attend the court’s ruling. The items in Demain and Douman that prompted the charges under the press code were: · An article about the budget that the state allocates to the royal court; · A montage that allegedly manipulated photographs from King Mohamed VI’s wedding to ridicule ex-interior minister Driss Basri and other political figures; · A cartoon on the “history of slavery” that lampooned the obsequiousness of local officials toward the monarchy; · An interview with Moroccan political activist Abdullah Zaâzaa in which he restated his well-known views critical of the monarchy as an institution and in favor of self-determination for the people of the disputed Western Sahara territory. In a nearly unprecedented move against a journalist in Morocco, Mrabet was imprisoned upon his original conviction by the Rabat Court of First Instance. The judge invoked Article 400 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which allows for the court to jail defendants who are appealing their convictions if they are deemed dangerous or likely to flee. The appeals court judge rejected defense motions to obtain Mrabet’s provisional release. Morocco’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression. But the press code, revised in 2002, provides prison terms for a wide array of speech offenses, such as the ones for which Mrabet was convicted. After this confirmation of the verdict on appeal, Mrabet’s only legal recourse is a pourvoi en cassation before the Supreme Court, a challenge that can be based on procedural but not on substantive issues. “This is a sad day for those who placed hope in the king’s pledges to expand public liberties,” said Megally. On April 17, prior to this conviction, Moroccan police prevented Mrabet from traveling to France, a move that was rescinded a week later. In November 2001, a court convicted him for an article in Demain concerning reports that one of the royal palaces might be sold for redevelopment. Sentenced then to four months in prison and a fine, Mrabet had been free pending an appeal of that verdict.","Middle East/North Africa, Morocco/Western Sahara",""

The European Council meeting is being held on June 20, 2003, which coincides with World Refugee Day. World Refugee Day was established as a date for governments to renew their commitment to solving refugee problems. """"European governments have a choice to make on World Refugee Day,"""" said Alison Parker, a refugee protection expert at Human Rights Watch. """"They can endorse the U.K. proposal and undermine more than fifty years of international commitment to the world's refugees -- or they can reject this deeply flawed plan and preserve a system that has saved countless lives."""" In its briefing paper, An Unjust """"Vision"""" for Europe's Refugees, Human Rights Watch said the U.K. proposal was an effort to dodge responsibilities under the 1951 Refugee Convention and other human rights treaties. The U.K. proposal undermines the fundamental right to seek asylum, and the right to be protected against return to an unsafe place. The proposal would also violate the Refugee Convention by penalizing refugees for their mode of entering the United Kingdom. The U.K. government claims that the proposal is needed because financial support for refugees is badly distributed. However, Parker pointed out that increasing funds for refugees in developing countries should not be justified by decreasing support for them in Europe. Human Rights Watch said that serious human rights violations often await asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants in the countries proposed for processing asylum claims under the U.K. plan. Those countries include Albania, Croatia, Iran, Morocco, Somalia, Romania, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. Human Rights Watch said that, despite their attempts to evade responsibility, the United Kingdom and other governments could still be complicit for harm experienced by persons transferred to processing centers. Police forces in all of the named countries except Croatia have been repeatedly accused of egregious misconduct, including returns to unsafe places, arbitrary arrests, detention and even arbitrary killings and torture of non-nationals. Some of such police misconduct has directly targeted refugees. The countries proposed to host the centers are also among the world's poorest. """"Britain has long been a leader in assisting the developing world. But now the United Kingdom is pushing other countries to take on its responsibility for protecting refugees,"""" Parker said.

Son is slated to be tried in Hanoi on June 18 on charges of spying. """"Vietnam's crackdown on critics who use the Internet to peacefully disseminate their ideas or communicate with democracy advocates abroad appears to be escalating,"""" said Minky Worden, electronic media director at Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch said that five other prominent critics of the government in Vietnam have been arrested and sentenced to harsh prison terms during the last year, several for using the Internet to express their views. According to an April 10, 2003 indictment obtained by Human Rights Watch, Pham Hong Son is charged with spying under article 80 of Vietnam's Penal Code because he """"took the initiative"""" to communicate by telephone and e-mail with """"political opportunists"""" in Vietnam and abroad. Spying is punishable by twelve to twenty years' imprisonment, a life sentence, or the death penalty. Son has been detained since March 2002 and is currently being held at B14 (Thanh Liet) detention center in Hanoi. The indictment states: """"Son willingly supported the view of these mentioned political opportunists and became a follower of the action plan to take advantage of freedom and democracy to advocate pluralism and a multiparty system in order to oppose the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam."""" The indictment further charges that Son received emails from dissidents abroad that stated that """"the way to change the nature of the current regime was to remove the restrictions imposed by the Party leadership and Government, and to unify and organize the forces of democracy and pluralism."""" The indictment also says Son used email to """"translate and send anti-Party and anti-government documents"""" to colleagues abroad. One of his alleged crimes was to translate and disseminate via email an article titled """"What is Democracy?"""" which he downloaded from the website of the U.S. Embassy in Vietnam. """"These harsh prison sentences and vaguely worded charges of spying appear designed to intimidate not only government critics, but everyone in Vietnam who uses the Internet,"""" said Worden. Vietnam's Penal Code lists numerous crimes against national security, some of which contain provisions that on their face violate international human rights law. Examples include article 88 of the Penal Code, """"Conducting propaganda against the Socialist Republic of Vietnam""""; article 87, """"Undermining the unity policy""""; and article 79, """"Carrying out activities aimed at overthrowing the people's administration."""" Dissidents who have been arrested during the past year include Nguyen Dan Que, arrested in March 2003 and charged under article 80, not yet tried; Nguyen Khac Toan, sentenced in December 2002 to twelve-years' imprisonment under article 80; Pham Que Duong, arrested in December 2002 and charged under article 80; Tran Van Khue, arrested in December 2002 and charged with making propaganda against the state (most likely under article 88); and Le Chi Quang, sentenced to four-years' imprisonment in October 2002 under article 88. Human Rights Watch said that Pham Hong Son and others are being held in violation of their fundamental rights, and called for their immediate release. Vietnam has been a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights since 1982.

On Monday, the respected Argentine jurist Luis Moreno Ocampo was sworn in as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court after being elected by the court's 90 member governments. This historic institution is now open for business, ready to prosecute those who commit genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. On Monday, the respected Argentine jurist Luis Moreno Ocampo was sworn in as chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court after being elected by the court's 90 member governments. This historic institution is now open for business, ready to prosecute those who commit genocide, war crimes or crimes against humanity. Unlike the old justice of impunity that allowed the likes of Augusto Pinochet and Pol Pot to go unpunished, the new justice of the international court, known as the ICC, reflects a growing global determination to bring the worst human rights criminals to justice. Yet the Bush administration continues its campaign against the court, although it is increasingly isolated in its opposition. On June 12, for example, Rumsfeld announced that Washington would oppose further spending on a new NATO headquarters in Brussels until Belgium repealed its universal jurisdiction law that allows the perpetrators of atrocities to be prosecuted in Belgian courts. Rumsfeld made the threat even though Belgium adopted legislation in April that provides ample protection against misdirected cases, while allowing its courts to continue as a forum of last resort for atrocity victims. Also on June 12, in the United Nations Security Council, the Bush administration secured renewal of a one-year exemption from ICC jurisdiction for American troops involved in UN-authorized military operations. After the extraordinary tensions over Iraq, the council wasn't game for another fight with the United States. Still, Washington had hoped to pave the way toward a permanent exemption. Its exceptionalism was greeted by a chorus of governmental objections. Meanwhile, U.S. envoys have been circling the globe threatening to cut off military aid and other benefits to any government that won't agree by July 1 never to send a U.S. suspect to the ICC. The European Union and its associated states have stood up to this strong-arming, but weaker and more vulnerable governments are having a harder time resisting. The Bush administration tries to justify its quest for such agreements by saying that it doesn't want to be held to a treaty it hasn't ratified. But that falsely characterizes the issue. No one suggests that, without ratification, the ICC should bind the United States. Rather, the question is whether other governments have a right to choose how to address crimes committed on their own territory, even if by U.S. citizens. Under long-accepted legal principles, the British government, say, is entitled to prosecute an American for committing murder on the streets of London. Similarly, in the case of atrocities committed on its territory, Britain can choose to delegate prosecuting power to the ICC. That the United States hasn't ratified the ICC treaty is irrelevant. All that matters is that the government on whose territory an American might commit such crimes has ratified the treaty and granted prosecuting power to the court. The Bush administration also tries to justify the bilateral agreements it is pursuing with other countries by citing a provision in the ICC treaty that allows governments to prioritize competing claims to prosecute certain suspects. For example, when a suspect's nationality differs from that of the territory where the alleged crime was committed, two governments have an interest in prosecution. In some cases, the ICC treaty allows these governments to agree between themselves which would have first crack at the case. The provision must be read in light of the ICC's purpose, however. Ruthless regimes have long committed atrocities with impunity. Dictators occasionally promised prosecutions, but with no international justice system to hold them accountable, the pledges were usually empty. The ICC's ability to override national prosecuting efforts that are not conducted in good faith reflects the determination of ICC member states to move beyond unverified pledges. The agreements sought by the Bush administration would undermine this core ICC principle. The stakes are high in the struggle to resist the Bush administration's vision of old justice. If Washington prevails, other governments will inevitably try to evade ICC oversight. That will advance impunity. Even if the United States succeeds only in immunizing its citizens from ICC scrutiny, the resulting two-tiered system of justice risks delegitimizing this important new institution.","United States, Global",""

The US military claimed that gunmen were using the car as cover, but protesters denied that any of them had opened fire. © Human Rights Watch     With major military operations continuing in al-Falluja, U.S. authorities should investigate the apparent use of excessive force against Iraqi protesters there on April 28 and 30, Human Rights Watch urged in a new report released today. The 18-page report, """"Violent Response: The U.S. Army in al-Falluja,"""" challenges the U.S. military's assertion that its troops came under direct fire from individuals in the crowd of protesters on April 28. Human Rights Watch found no conclusive evidence of bullet damage on the school where the soldiers were based. In contrast, buildings facing the school had extensive multi-caliber bullet impacts that were inconsistent with U.S. assertions that soldiers had responded with """"precision fire."""" The Human Rights Watch report also asserts that U.S. authorities failed to equip or adequately train the troops, primarily paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division, for the complex law enforcement tasks of military occupation. U.S. military and political authorities are also to blame for placing combat-ready soldiers in the highly volatile environment of al-Falluja without adequate law enforcement training and crowd control devices, the report said. Even translators were lacking. """"The U.S. military presence in al-Fallujah began with these tragic events in late April, and it has been troubled ever since,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"What is needed is a thorough investigation of possible violations of international humanitarian law by U.S. troops."""" Megally said that U.S. forces perceived a threat from the crowd that day, but the evidence indicates that they responded with disproportionate force. U.S. forces moved into al-Falluja, a town of 300,000 about sixty kilometers (thirty-five miles) west of Baghdad, on April 23. On April 28, a demonstration calling for U.S. soldiers to leave turned confrontational. Iraqi witnesses said that U.S. soldiers fired without provocation, killing seventeen people and wounding more than seventy. U.S. soldiers and commanders on the scene and Central Command headquarters asserted that the soldiers returned """"precision fire"""" against gunmen in the crowd who had opened fire first. Two days later, a military convoy driving through al-Falluja opened fire in the midst of another demonstration, killing three Iraqis and wounding at least sixteen. Human Rights Watch interviewed victims, witnesses, and U.S. soldiers and commanders, and investigated ballistics evidence at the scene. Under international humanitarian law, the United States, as the occupying power in Iraq, has the obligation to ensure public order and safety, Human Rights Watch said. When engaged in law enforcement functions, such as crowd control, law enforcement standards should govern their actions. The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials apply to all those who exercise police powers, including soldiers when they are acting in this capacity. Law enforcement officials may use lethal force only """"when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life."""" When doing so they must act with restraint and in proportion to the seriousness of the offence, minimize injury, and respect and preserve human life. Human Rights Watch called on U.S. authorities to carry out a full, independent, and impartial investigation of the al-Falluja incidents. Such an investigation should aim to determine the full circumstances that led to the killing of as many as twenty Iraqis, and to hold accountable anyone found to have violated international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch's findings are not a substitute for a full independent and impartial investigation, which would have access to classified evidence such as communications between U.S. commanders, debriefings of the soldiers involved, and other intelligence sources, Megally said. An investigation should also focus on the possible role of provocateurs within the crowd. If the investigation finds there was unlawful use of force, the U.S. government should provide compensation to victims, Megally said.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, United States","Children's Rights, Attacks on Education"

The ruling overturns a lower court decision ordering the government to release the names of detainees swept up in the investigation of the September 11 attacks. “Secret detentions have no place in a democracy,” said Jamie Fellner, U.S. Program Director for Human Rights Watch. “Yet the court has given the government permission to cast a mantle of darkness over its arrests.” Under today’s 2-1 decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Center for National Security Studies v. Ashcroft, the Department of Justice will not have to release the names of and other information about the hundreds it arrested on immigration charges and material witness warrants in the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. Plaintiffs, including Human Rights Watch, sought release of their names under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court ruled that all of the information sought was statutorily exempt from disclosure because it was information compiled for law enforcement purposes, and disclosure “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” Despite formal requests from Congress and advocacy groups, the Department of Justice has refused to release the names of the detainees. Instead, it has asserted broad authority to keep all of the names secret, arguing that revealing them would compromise national security by providing terrorists with a roadmap of its investigations. Today’s decision accepted the government’s assertions at face value, overruling a lower court decision that had dismissed the government’s claims of harm to national security as “pure speculation.” Refusing to look closely at the government’s vague assertions of harm, the court asserted the importance of judicial deference to the executive branch in matters of national security. The court said it would not “second guess” the executive branch on such matters. “The government shouldn’t be able to justify secret arrests simply by invoking the words ‘national security,’” said Fellner. In a harsh dissent, Judge Tatel takes the majority to task for eviscerating FOIA, and ignoring the principles of openness in government that FOIA embodies. Judge Tatel recognized that some of the information sought, e.g. the names of certain detainees and their places of arrest, might be legitimately withheld. But he criticized the majority for not requiring the government to provide for each detainee or category of detainees, the specific basis for withholding their names, and each additional item of information sought. For example, Judge Tatel questioned how releasing the names of detainees whom the government found to be wholly innocent of any connection to or knowledge about terrorist groups could possibly harm national security. Judge Tatel acknowledged the “uniquely compelling” public interest in the September 11 investigation. But he said the majority decision overlooked the interest of citizens knowing whether their government “is violating the constitutional rights of the hundreds of persons whom it has detained in connection with its terrorism investigation.” As part of the federal government’s post-September 11 investigation, the Immigration and Naturalization Services (INS) arrested 762 non-citizens on immigration charges and treated them as “special interest” cases. A recent report by the Justice Department’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) strongly criticized the Department for including among the special interest detainees Muslim men from middle-eastern countries who the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the INS encountered coincidentally or by happenstance with no indication they had any ties to terrorism. All the “special interest” detainees were subjected to numerous measures that deprived them of basic rights, including delays in filing charges following arrest, restrictions on access to counsel, the INS’ refusal to release them on bond and refusal to implement promptly judicial deportation orders and unnecessarily harsh conditions of confinement. Human Rights Watch documented these abuses in """"Presumption of Guilt,"""", a report issued in August of 2002. The OIG report confirmed Human Rights Watch’s conclusion that the government was using INS charges to secure the “preventive detention” of persons that is not permitted under criminal law. The court’s decision also sanctions the practice of withholding the names of the fifty or so people arrested and detained as material witnesses in connection with the September 11 investigation. Ostensibly detained to ensure their testimony before grand juries, many of the material witness detainees were never brought before grand juries, but were held for weeks and months in solitary confinement while being interrogated by government agents. Human Rights Watch believes the Department of Justice misused material witness warrants to secure the detention of persons when it had no grounds to arrest them on criminal or immigration charges.","United States",""

It expresses all EU Member States' willingness to support the ICC and cooperate to increase its effectiveness. The EU's bolstering of international justice comes as the ICC Prosecutor takes office today in The Hague, while the Bush administration steps up its efforts to exempt American citizens from the court's jurisdiction.     """"The European Union's commitment to take a more active role will help to safeguard the ICC as it begins its vital work,"""" said Lotte Leicht, director of Human Rights Watch's Brussels office. """"The new EU Common Position is an eloquent rejoinder to U.S. pressure on weaker states.""""     Because the ICC treaty entered into force a year ago, the EU resolved to adapt its Common Position in order to meet the new challenges confronting the ICC. Now that the court has elected its eighteen judges and Prosecutor, the EU has decided to take measures to strengthen its effective cooperation with the ICC. At the same time, the EU is responding to recent efforts by the Bush administration to weaken the court.     The new common position includes a first reference to the U.S. bilateral immunity agreements and draws the attention of third states to the EU Council Conclusions of September 30, 2002 when entering negotiations with the United States. The future and candidate EU states also associated themselves with the renewed Common Position.     The United States has recently placed heavy pressure on EU future and candidate states, as well as aspiring countries, notably in the Balkans. However, Slovenia has cited its desire to comply with the EU Guiding Principles as a justification for not bowing to U.S. pressure. Croatia has taken the same approach.     """"The Slovenian and Croatian examples highlight the importance of EU support, particularly when such pressure is coming from the United States,"""" said Leicht. """"We encourage future EU and candidate countries to adhere to a principled position based on their treaty obligations.""""     The United States has criticized the EU for influencing the decision of future EU members about signing bilateral immunity agreements. Washington is threatening to withhold military and financial assistance from countries that do not sign such agreements.     """"The EU, by contrast, is standing firm by reminding states that these bilateral agreements run counter to the Rome treaty and that states parties should not enter agreements that would weaken it,"""" Leicht said.     On September 30, 2002, the EU adopted its Guiding Principles stipulating that the U.S. immunity agreements in their original version """"would be inconsistent with ICC states parties' obligations....""""     To date, 90 countries have ratified the Rome Statute, which entered into force on July 1, 2002. The ICC is the first permanent world court that will have jurisdiction over genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It will intervene to investigate and prosecute such crimes only in the event state parties are """"unwilling or unable"""" to do so. The court was inaugurated on March 11, 2003 when its first 18 judges were sworn in.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum (ARF) complements other ASEAN dialogues with discussions on regional security issues and transnational problems such as counter-terrorism. ARF comprises the members of ASEAN plus their dialogue partners Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, India, Japan, Mongolia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, North Korea, South Korea, Russia and the United States. The regional security forum has pledged support to the international campaign against terrorism, but has been conspicuously silent on human rights issues. Other comparable regional organizations, such as the Organization of American States (OAS), the Organization of Security Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), and the Council of Europe, have built human rights safeguards into their counter-terrorist initiatives. """"ASEAN is right to focus on the threat of terrorism, but should commit to building in protections for due process and human rights,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"The campaign against terror must not be a green light for indefinite detention without trial or torture."""" Human Rights Watch said that many ARF members were abusing human rights on the pretext of fighting terrorism, or had extended new security assistance and cooperation to abusive governments in the region: The Australian government has used the rhetoric of counter-terrorism to justify its hardline policies on refugee and asylum issues and has sought extended powers of detention for its security agency. China has stepped up its campaign against Uighur separatists in Xinjiang province by invoking the war on terror, blurring the distinction between peaceful activists and those with genuine connections to international terrorist organizations. The Indian government enacted the new Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), which closely resembles a discredited, earlier security law that led to tens of thousands of politically motivated detentions, torture, and other human rights violations against perceived political opponents in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Many of the measures adopted by the U.S. government after the September 11 attacks have violated fundamental provisions of international human rights and humanitarian law. Following the Bali bomb attack in October 2002, the Indonesian government has passed new anti-terrorist laws that seriously curb fundamental rights, and has used the rhetoric of counter-terrorism to justify crackdowns on opponents in Aceh and Papua. Russia has continued to justify its actions in Chechnya as a tightly focused counter-terrorism operation, despite the fact that it has produced vast civilian casualties, including extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances. Malaysia and Singapore have used their long-standing Internal Security Acts to detain terrorism suspects without trial and chill free expression and public criticism.  In many European Union member states, new laws, policies, and practices have undermined fundamental human rights protections, including the right to seek asylum and prohibitions against arbitrary detention and torture. """"The best way to prevent terrorism is to bolster human rights protections and to build civil society institutions,"""" Adams said. """"Indeed, repression breeds terrorism by channeling political grievances into extremist violence."""" Human Rights Watch called on the ASEAN Regional Forum to ensure counter-terrorist measures were consistent with international human rights standards, and to include human rights experts in its working groups on this issue. ARF members should also invite the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and other independent experts to monitor and analyze the human rights impact of security laws and policies in the region.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Australia, China and Tibet, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Russia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/06/15/why-us-needs-court","Why the US needs this court","Why the US needs this court","","06/15/2003","First, the good news, which deserves to be savoured for a moment. The inauguration in the Hague tomorrow of the first chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court marks a remarkable moment in history. Dictators and tyrants around the world can be brought to book, by a single court. It is an astonishing achievement - and one that seemed, until just a few years ago, quite unimaginable. Even after the signing in 1998 of the Rome Treaty, which laid the foundations for the new court, many believed that the ICC would never become real. They were wrong. Last year, the number of countries ratifying the treaty reached 60, thus allowing the court itself to be created. The prosecutor and judges have been selected. Now, to crown that process, the inauguration tomorrow of Luis Moreno Ocampo - a former prosecutor of the Argentine junta - means that the ICC show is well and truly on the road. Last July, when the court was constituted as a formal entity, it remained without practical power. From tomorrow, its power will be tangible. The court will be authorised to prosecute some of the horrific crimes now being committed around the world - for example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which may provide the first cases. Ninety countries, including almost all the world's major democracies, have now ratified the treaty. But not the United States - which is where the problems begin. Those problems are increasing by the month and by the day. The US administration, not content with refusing to ratify, and then 'unsigning' the treaty (a murky legal concept, at best), seeks to prevent this crucial instrument of international justice from building up the strength it needs to do its work successfully. It is, in short, doing its level best to kill the court. (The 'Hague invasion clause', signed into law by President Bush last year, allows him to use 'all means necessary and appropriate' to free US servicemen detained by the ICC.) In recent days, there have been small glimmers of light. A vote in the Security Council last Thursday was 12-0 in favour of a renewal of a special one-year deal that was agreed last July, allowing US peacekeepers immunity from prosecution. That sounds like another victory for the US hawks. But equally significant were the diplomatic dogs that refused to bark: France and Germany both withheld their vote, because they were so unhappy at the US pressures. Nor was this just the same old post-Iraq rift. Kofi Annan himself warned that the court - and the Security Council - would be undermined, if such renewals became an annual routine. Many countries - from Switzerland to South Africa - spoke out against the idea that the Security Council should start rewriting international treaties. The US pressures at the United Nations have been only part of the story. The bully tactics against countries which defy America by refusing to weaken their commitment to the court have become blatant in recent months, as private (and much-denied) arm-twisting has given way to public threats. Countries vulnerable to American pressure - these days, the list of such countries is long - are told that unless they offer the Americans the desired immunity from prosecution, punishment will be swift and severe. Thus, the US ambassador to Zagreb recently published an open letter warning that Croatia would lose $19 million in military assistance if it failed to sign. Other countries have received similar threats; some - like the Bosnians, who, one might think, had already suffered more than their fair share of threats and ultimatums in recent years - have reluctantly surrendered. The irony is obvious: that Washington simultaneously demands complete co-operation with international justice at the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal (or else), and complete non-co-operation with international justice at the ICC (or else). Elsewhere, Caribbean countries have been told that they will no longer be eligible for hurricane assistance unless they give the Americans what they want, right now. Like every practised bully, Washington has given an early date for the implementation of its threats. For many countries, the proclaimed deadline for kowtowing to the US pressures runs out on 1 July, the first anniversary of the court itself. The American view of the court, described by the deputy US ambassador to the UN as 'a fatally flawed institution', is that the court will act as a giant conspiracy against America. Accordingly, Americans will be unfairly targeted. But this misunderstands the essence of the court. The ICC is a court of last resort, which prosecutes only the most serious war crimes and crimes against humanity, and comes into play only where domestic courts have shown themselves unwilling or unable to prosecute. Despite the depressing and dangerous insouciance about international law shown by America at Guantanamo and elsewhere, one would assume that US politicians and commanders are not eager to commit atrocities on a grand scale, à la Saddam or Milosevic, which could bring them before the ICC. As Kofi Annan pointed out, no UN peacekeeper of any nationality has been accused of a crime 'anywhere near the crimes that fall under the jurisdiction of the ICC'. The Americans may be right to fear that there will be attempts to bring politically motivated cases. But the court has a solid panoply of safeguards, which make it difficult to imagine that malicious and frivolous cases could get past judicial first base. Britain, which played a key role during the negotiations of the Rome treaty five years ago, has in recent months played a less dignified role - constantly eager to tweak the European diplomatic language in order (unsuccessfully) to appease the US loathing of the court. The UK has been depressingly reluctant to confront Washington's bully tactics, confining itself instead to occasional hand wringing expressions of regret. And yet, almost no issue can be of greater importance. The strength of the ICC -which does not have retrospective jurisdiction beyond July 2002 - can become an international guarantor of stability in the years to come. American contempt for the court - and its determination to bring the court's supporters to heel - sends a disastrous message worldwide. It suggests that there is one standard of justice for Americans and another for everybody else. Such haughty foolishness makes the world a less safe place - for Americans too.","United States, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

In a new briefing paper, Human Rights Watch said that action should also be taken by the government to investigate recent incidents of political violence and intimidation that have had a chilling effect on the electoral climate.  """"Unless concrete changes are immediately implemented, Cambodians will go to the polls with minimal information about their political choices and with fears about their safety influencing how they vote,"""" said James Ross, senior legal advisor at Human Rights Watch. """"At a time when political speech and association should be encouraged, it is being increasingly restricted."""" Human Rights Watch called on the members of the ASEAN Regional Forum, including U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and Japanese Foreign Minister Yoriko Kawaguchi, to insist on fundamental improvements by the Cambodian government at their meetings in Phnom Penh next week.  The ASEAN Regional Forum and ASEAN members, as well as Cambodia's international donors, should insist that the Cambodian government:  Ensure that political violence and other electoral violations are promptly investigated, prosecuted, and punished according to the National Assembly Election Law and Cambodian criminal law; Respect the rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression in the pre-election period; and Immediately allow opposition parties fair access to the broadcast media.  The briefing paper concludes that electoral violence continues to plague Cambodia's political environment. The assassination of high-profile politicians, such as the royalist Funcinpec party's senior advisor and former member of parliament, Om Radsady, in February, and the murders of twelve political activists for Funcinpec and the Sam Rainsy Party since last year's local elections, are a reminder that politics remains a deadly game for those who dare to challenge the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Hun Sen.  """"Cambodia has now been holding elections for a decade, but little has been done either to protect opposition parties from political violence or ensure they can campaign on an equal footing with the ruling CPP,"""" said Ross. """"If things don't change, no one should be surprised if Cambodian voters start losing faith in this process."""" Cambodian voters remain at the mercy of local authorities, who continue to use threats, coercion, and intimidation to ensure support for the ruling party. Cases of politically related violence and intimidation go unpunished so often that voters, party activists, and even senior political figures remain highly vulnerable.  Human Rights Watch found that the Cambodian government has used the January anti-Thai riots--in which government security forces stepped aside and allowed mobs to attack the Thai embassy and Thai businesses--as an excuse to clamp down on the right to demonstrate and hold political rallies. In late May, the National Election Committee and the Ministry of Interior decided to restrict private and public meetings of political parties outside the campaign period on the grounds of maintaining public order.  """"The pretext of national security and public order is now being to used to deny peaceful rallies by students, victims of domestic violence, and environmentalists,"""" said Ross.  In addition, the government's persistent unwillingness to open up the broadcast media to opposition political parties means that only information about the incumbent CPP consistently reaches voters.  """"If voters cannot get information about their choices at the ballot box, parties cannot meet freely and get their messages out to people, and fear is determining voters' choices, the purpose of holding an election at all is defeated,"""" said Ross.  Human Rights Watch also called upon the National Election Committee to implement a thorough and impartial electoral complaints process. All political parties should refrain from violence, racist rhetoric, and vote buying.  Human Rights Watch urged international and local observers to refrain from reaching hasty public judgments about the election immediately after the polling without taking into account the full context of the election and long-standing problems with violence, intimidation, media access, and the fears of voters, activists, and candidates.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Beijing's dark side has been exemplified by its knee-jerk resort to draconian measures, including threats to execute """"intentional transmitters"""" of SARS, arrests of those who send text messages """"spreading rumors"""" about the epidemic, and the jailing of a doctor who accidentally infected his family with the virus. These measures have no place in a public health emergency, no matter how grave.  There has, however, been one ray of hope since the outbreak of SARS. Since April, the Chinese Communist Party has fired the national director of the Ministry of Health, the mayor of Beijing, and over 100 other health officials for underreporting SARS infection rates. The cover-up of local infection rates contributed significantly to the spread of the disease. While senior Chinese officials called for an end to """"delay, cover-up or missing cases,"""" World Health Organization officials continued to express concern about underreporting. But for the first time, Beijing appears to be holding officials to account for lying about an epidemic. Now that the precedent has been set, the party should also look into the massive HIV/AIDS blood scandal in Henan province. In Beijing, government officials have admitted they covered up the numbers of those infected with SARS. In Henan, no action has yet been taken against officials responsible for an even worse cover-up, over the spread of HIV to at least one million men, women and children through a contaminated blood sales network. Henan officials banned international and Chinese journalists trying to report on the epidemic, harassed doctors who tried to speak the truth, and, worst of all, blocked access to AIDS organizations offering much-needed services to whole villages of dying farmers and their children. In Beijing, officials were fired. In Henan, they were promoted. Take Liu Quanxi, head of the Henan provincial Ministry of Health. AIDS activists and Chinese press claim that Mr. Liu aggressively developed Henan's for-profit blood collection stations in the 1990s. As the Chinese government has since acknowledged, such stations, common in rural China, inadvertently transmitted HIV to large populations because they used a system that pooled and extracted valuable plasma while reinjecting red blood cells to donors. This collection system, along with the use of unclean needles and equipment, fuelled the rapid spread of the virus among whole villages. Yet this February, Mr. Liu was named to a deputy directorship of a people's congress committee on health, education and culture, and was praised for his """"important contributions to the development of the province's sanitation industry."""" Chen Kuiyuan was the Henan Communist Party chief from 2000-02. During his tenure, international and Chinese journalists who tried to visit Henan were detained by police and expelled. Outspoken critics of the blood collection scandal, such as retired Dr. Gao Yaojie, reported harassment by local officials, and were ordered not to speak to the press about Henan's epidemic. Chinese NGOs offering help were questioned by police, and their tapes of interviews with villagers were confiscated. In January, Mr. Chen was named president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, China's premier research institute. Why would anyone lie about such a vast epidemic? The answer was simple: Covering up the spread of a stigmatized disease like AIDS might help to ensure that investment continued to pour into impoverished provinces like Henan. The Henan blood scandal sent a clear message to other local officials: if you have an epidemic, cover it up, and you'll be rewarded. Beijing officials who lied about SARS made what appeared to be a safe bet. Fortunately, this time they lost. Hu Jintao's new government has a chance to change the shameful record set by its predecessors. Thanks to SARS, the Henan scandal, and the poisoning of dozens of children by snacks sold in unclean street stalls, Chinese popular indignation on Internet bulletin boards about the cover-up of public health crises is at an all-time high. Now is the time for China's leadership to launch a thorough investigation of officials in Henan and hold those responsible accountable. The party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is one body that could do this job. The mandate of this commission has expanded over the past five years, growing from simple cases of government corruption to regulation of the for-profit medical industry. No doubt Beijing's recent change of policy is due in part to the international panic about SARS. Many programs, business ventures and conventions were cancelled. Had the Henan blood scandal drawn the international condemnation that SARS has, imagine how quickly the central government might have responded.

""""For the third consecutive year, the State Department report fails to give hard figures on the number of people being trafficked,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The report gives undue credit for minimal effort and ignores government practices, such as summary deportation and incarceration, that effectively punish trafficking victims.""""  The State Department released the 177-page report today to comply with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The report evaluates the performance of 116 countries, putting each country in one of three categories, depending on how its domestic efforts meet the legislation's minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. Tier 3 countries are deemed to be not in compliance with the minimum standards and not making significant efforts; Tier 2 countries are not in compliance, but making significant efforts; and Tier 1 countries are in compliance. The report covers countries worldwide with a """"significant number"""" of trafficking victims.  The State Department consistently credits countries for their efforts to combat trafficking even when they have not passed legislation specifically criminalizing all forms of forced labor as trafficking, or when they have failed to sign or ratify the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress, and Punish Trafficking supplementing the U.N. Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime, the single most authoritative international human rights instrument on trafficking. Another consistent shortcoming is that Tier 2, where seventy-five countries fall, remains a catch-all category. Tier 2 comprises countries of varied trafficking records. The report also fails adequately to explain its concrete minimum standards for countries to move up tiers.  Human Rights Watch said that if this report is to be useful, it must improve its analytical framework for country narratives. """"We know government corruption and complicity is an undeniable fact of trafficking,"""" said Jefferson. """"Facts about how many government agents have been tried, prosecuted, and convicted for trafficking-related offenses are absolutely essential to evaluating a government's record.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that the report has improved since last year, in part by including more countries, better organizing the country narratives, ensuring that the report included information on trafficking into many forms of forced labor, and discussing domestic as well as international trafficking.  Human Rights Watch urges the State Department to:  Ensure that all future reports include all reliable data on the number of trafficking victims in each country, disaggregated by age, sex, nationality, and the nature of their forced labor;  Categorize as Tier 3 any country that summarily deports or incarcerates trafficking victims;  Bar from being placed in Tier 1 any country that fails to enact specific legislation criminalizing trafficking;  Add the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and its Optional Protocol to the list of """"Relevant International Conventions"""" that it appends to the report; and  Ensure that all future reports adequately weigh efforts toward eliminating and punishing corruption in assessing a country's record on combating trafficking  Select Illustrations of the Report's Shortcomings: Catch-All Tiering: Tier 2 encompasses countries of widely disparate records, from Nigeria, where the government has been involved in an aggressive anti-trafficking awareness campaign and has cooperated with other governments to combat trafficking to Laos, where there are no government-sponsored prevention efforts, no anti-trafficking legislation, no capacity for arrests and prosecutions, state corruption is a huge problem, and the one international agreement signed with Thailand excludes children altogether, although child trafficking is a significant problem.  Malaysia: Malaysia should be a Tier 3 country. Malaysia's anti-trafficking efforts have focused on penalizing victims rather than protecting them. The State Department report itself states, """"foreign trafficking victims…are generally treated as immigration offenders, often detained and held for up to several months before deportation."""" Further, there is no comprehensive anti-trafficking law and in 2002, there were no prosecutions for the specific offense of trafficking.  Japan: Japan should be placed in Tier 3. Specific legislation prohibiting trafficking does not exist and there is no indication that there will be. In fact, there are special agreements that facilitate trafficking, allowing the admittance of """"entertainers"""" into the country but not unskilled workers. Trafficking cases are not aggressively pursued and penalties are weak. Though the government has funded international programs to increase awareness in other countries, little to nothing has been done to control the growing trafficking issue in Japan. [More...]  Pakistan: Although there are some indications that the Pakistan government is dedicating more resources to control trafficking along its border with Iran, discriminatory laws still exist under the Zinah or Hudood ordinances that treat victims like criminals. These laws criminalize extramarital sex and use victim testimony as admissions of adultery, therefore discouraging victims from bringing forth their cases. [More...]  Qatar: The State Department's various reports on Qatar are inconsistent on the issue of trafficking. While the most recent Department of State Human Rights Country Report on Qatar notes that its government did not investigate or prosecute traffickers actively, the Trafficking in Persons report states that law enforcement agencies do actively investigate allegations of trafficking. Kuwait & Saudi Arabia: Both countries should have remained in Tier 3. Neither has laws specifically prohibiting trafficking. In addition, labor laws in both countries exclude domestic workers, making them especially vulnerable to employer abuse, including trafficking. Services for trafficking victims are few or non-existent.  Benin: Benin has not enacted domestic laws specifically prohibiting trafficking in persons, a step that should be minimum standards for inclusion in Tier 1. The report refers only to Benin's investigation and arrest rate of trafficking cases and fails to analyze its prosecution record. In contrast, the Department of State Human Rights Country Report on Benin states, """"The Government publicized various arrests of potential traffickers; however, there were no reports of subsequent legal action against the alleged traffickers.""""  Gabon: The report makes no reference to the investigation or prosecution of trafficking cases. The Department of State Human Rights Country Report on Gabon reveals, """"The Government did not actively investigate cases of trafficking and has not prosecuted any cases against traffickers."""" Gabon is also a good example of a general failure to address government corruption and complicity, which, according to the report, has been raised as a serious concern by local organizations Laos: Laos should be Tier 3. Laos is weak on prevention, prosecution, and protection. It does not monitor its borders well, it fails to arrest and prosecute traffickers, and corruption remains a serious problem. The steps taken towards victim protection are highly flawed: some victims have been punished for illegal border crossings and even sent to re-education seminars. A memorandum of understanding signed with Thailand addressing repatriation of Laos trafficking victims excludes children, despite child trafficking being a serious problem. Togo: The report announces that Togo has prosecuted fifty traffickers, but provides no information on the results of these prosecutions. Unless prosecuted to completion, child traffickers will continue to entice children within and across borders and exploit them with impunity.

""""The CCDP report demonstrates that investigations into the abuses is possible, if the political will exists to hold the perpetrators responsible.""""  Between 1984 and 1994, thousands of persons """"disappeared"""" and were believed illegally cremated in Punjab as part of a brutal police crackdown to quash insurgency in the state.

The campaign succeeded in eliminating most of the major militant groups, and by early 1993, the government claimed that normalcy had returned to the state. Police abuses continued, however, and there was no effort to account for hundreds of forced disappearances and summary killings.

On May 28, the U.S. Ambassador to Croatia published an open letter in a Zagreb daily, raising the pressure on the Croatian government to sign an immunity deal. The Ambassador warned Croatia that it would lose $19 million in military assistance if it failed to sign and issued a veiled threat that Croatia's accession into NATO is contingent on an immunity agreement.     """"In light of the war-related atrocities affecting hundreds of thousands of victims and implicating senior leaders as war criminals, the ratification of the ICC Treaty by all the former Yugoslav republics was particularly significant,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"It is therefore vital that Croatia and Slovenia not cave in to U.S. threats.""""     On June 2, after the breakdown of talks between the U.S. team and Slovene officials, the U.S. negotiating team committed to continue lobbying the Slovenian government, also threatening the withdrawal of military assistance. Despite these pressures, both Croatia and Slovenia have so far rebuffed the U.S. threats, looking instead to the European Union, which has urged the former Yugoslav republics to reject Washington's bullying.     """"While the United States rightly insists that the former Yugoslav republics must fully cooperate with the ITCY, it is turning the screws on the very same states not to cooperate with the ICC,"""" said Dicker.     Human Rights Watch said that by rejecting the U.S. government blackmail, Zagreb and Ljubljana have stood firmly behind principles of justice, accountability and the rule of law. """"Both governments have adopted the principled approach to this court advocated by their European partners,"""" said Dicker.     While the Bush administration marshals extensive diplomatic resources to pursue its agenda, Croatia, Slovenia and European Union members have responded very differently. In reaching out to its neighbors on this issue, the European Union has maintained that the U.S. immunity requests are incompatible with a fair and effective ICC.     """"Giving in to the U.S. request for immunity would endorse a two-tiered system of justice -- one for U.S. citizens and one for the rest of the world,"""" said Dicker.     The United States has had some success in the region. Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania recently signed immunity deals, although their parliaments have yet to ratify them. Serbia and Montenegro and the Republic of Macedonia have also been targets of recent pressure by U.S. negotiators.     Human Rights Watch said the ratification of the ICC Treaty by all former Yugoslav republics is particularly significant. War crimes trials conducted at the ICTY in The Hague over the past seven years have demonstrated that international tribunals can pursue accountability in a manner that honors the rights of both victims and perpetrators.

Cavallo, a former Argentine military official, faces prosecution in Spain for atrocities committed during Argentina’s military dictatorship. According to the principle of universal jurisdiction, human rights atrocities committed in one country can be subject to criminal prosecution by courts in another country. The principle has helped make it more difficult for human rights abusers to find safe haven abroad to escape justice for their crimes.  “This case represents a real victory for international justice,” said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. “Mexico will become the first Latin American country to extradite someone for gross human rights violations under the principle of universal jurisdiction.”  According to a November 1999 indictment issued by Spanish Judge Balthazar Garzón, Cavallo, known by the name of Miguel Angel Cavallo, was a Navy lieutenant working in the notorious Navy Mechanics School (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada, ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the military regime. Between January 1977 and October 1978, the indictment states, Cavallo belonged to the operations sector of Working Group 3.3.2, a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing persons perceived as leftist by the military.  The indictment implicates Cavallo in the torture of Thelma Jara de Cabezas, and the execution of Mónica Jauregui and Elba Delia Aldaya.  The 1984 report of the Argentine truth commission names 8,961 people who “disappeared” under the military dictatorship, noting that this figure is not exhaustive. Although some high-level officials were criminally prosecuted in Argentina in the 1980s for these abuses, the vast majority of military perpetrators were protected by the country’s amnesty laws. Pardons issued by then-President Menem in 1989 and 1990 freed the few who had been convicted.  The Mexican Supreme Court authorized Cavallo’s extradition on charges of genocide and terrorism, but not on charges of torture. A lower court had previously ruled that Cavallo could not be extradited for torture on the grounds that, under Mexican law, the statute of limitations for a torture prosecution would have expired.  “In a region where far too many human rights violators have escaped justice, Mexico is setting an important example that other countries should emulate,” said Vivanco.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Argentina, Mexico, Spain","International Justice"

Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) The terms of reference for Security Council mission state that it will remind the government of the DRC, its neighbors, and armed political groups of their obligations under international humanitarian law, and that they respect human rights, ensure the safety of the civilian population, and cease supporting armed groups and militias. This is an extremely important and timely message, both for the current crisis in Ituri, and for the DRC more broadly.  In his second special report on the United Nations Organization Mission in the DRC (MONUC), published on May 27, 2003, Secretary-General Kofi Annan recognized the importance of human rights in this crisis. He said, “Without strong national human rights protection structures in place and an end to the widespread reign of impunity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, there cannot be any real reconciliation or the building of the foundation of long-term, sustainable peace.”   Crisis in Ituri Despite three peace agreements aimed at ending the five year-old Congolese war, fighting in eastern DRC, particularly in Ituri and South Kivu, intensified in late 2002 and early 2003. The current violence in Bunia is only the latest episode in this war that has left an estimated 3.3 million civilians dead throughout the Congo, a toll that makes it more deadly to civilians than any other since World War II.  While Human Right Watch welcomes the recent decision by the Security Council to authorize an Interim Emergency Multinational Force for Bunia with a Chapter VII mandate, we continue to believe that the DRC presents the Security Council with a critical test of its stated commitment to protect civilians. We are particularly concerned about the protection of civilians outside of Bunia, which currently is not within the multinational force’s mandate.   The Interim Force will help to stabilize the situation in Bunia, but it should also address the need to protect civilians in other parts of Ituri and the eastern DRC.  Tens of thousands of civilians have fled from Bunia, joining more than 500,000 displaced from previous fighting; the fate of many of these people is unknown. Hema and Lendu armed groups remain fully armed and ready to attack again.  Recent reports of fighting in Aru, Tchomia, and Mongbwalu indicate that the violence continues.  War crimes, crimes against humanity and other violations of international humanitarian and human rights law have been carried out on a massive scale in Ituri. Armed groups have massacred unarmed civilians, often solely on the basis of their ethnicity.   They have also committed summary executions, rapes, arbitrary arrests, and torture; all groups have recruited children for military service, some as young as seven years old.   Armed groups have deliberately prevented humanitarian agencies from delivering assistance to people whom they have defined as their enemies, resulting in further deaths.  Uganda, the occupying power in Ituri from 1998 until its withdrawal in May 2003, has failed in its legal obligation to protect the civilian population. From its initial involvement in a land dispute between the Hema and Lendu ethnic groups in 1999 through its joint operation with Lendu and Ngiti militias to dislodge the Hema from Bunia in March 2003, the Ugandan army has largely aggravated rather than calmed ethnic and political hostilities. In the past year, the RCD-Goma, backed by Rwanda, and the RCD-ML, backed by the DRC, have become increasingly active in the area, contributing to further conflict and backing new armed groups. The Security Council should ensure that the Ugandan, Rwandan and DRC governments commit themselves to not providing any military or financial assistance to political armed groups in Ituri.  As the Secretary-General’s report noted, “External actors must recognize their accountability for the actions of those armed groups they helped create and must cease to supply them or give them succor.” MONUC, with some 700 troops in Bunia, has been completely overwhelmed and has been unable to adequately protect civilians and restore calm to this volatile region.   The force lacks a robust mandate such as that of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force for Ituri and has proved ineffective in quelling the violence and protecting civilians. Following this visit to the DRC, we trust the Security Council will consider an urgent strengthening of the overall MONUC mandate to ensure it is robust enough to protect civilians both in Ituri and elsewhere.  The Kivus The complex mix of local, national, and regional conflicts exists also in the Kivus, where civilians have suffered from massacres and other grave abuses. The continuation of this kind of local level combat endangers the peace process throughout the country and in the Great Lakes as a whole.   In South Kivu, local sources report serious abuses by the Rwandan backed RCD-Goma against civilians and those accused of supporting the Mai Mai.  For example, in Walungu between April 7 – 14, 2003 RCD-Goma troops allegedly attacked numerous villages near Burhale killing some 55 people and systematically raping women and girls.  Similar acts have also been reported in Walikali.   Human rights activists and other members of civil society who report on these and others issues are often harassed and arrested by the RCD-Goma authorities.  Independent radio stations such as Radio Maendeleo have been closed down for broadcasting “political content” and others have been threatened.  Sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war by most of the forces involved in this conflict. Combatants of the RCD, Rwandan soldiers, as well as combatants of the forces opposed to them– Mai-Mai, armed groups of Rwandan Hutu, and Burundian rebels of the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (Forces pour la défense de la démocratie, FDD) and Front for National Liberation (Front pour la libération nationale, FNL)– have frequently and sometimes systematically raped women and girls. Ending Impunity Those responsible for serious abuses of human rights and humanitarian law in the DRC are rarely, if ever, brought to justice. International leaders and the Security Council regularly denounce the crimes, but have failed to end them or to hold their perpetrators legally accountable.  As a follow up to Security Council resolution 1468, the Security Council mission should recommend the establishment of an international justice mechanism to hold accountable those responsible for serious abuses of human rights and humanitarian law. Such a court must function with full independence and impartiality and according to international standards of due process. In its meetings with DRC government officials, the Security Council mission should urge the government to make the establishment of a national justice system a priority so as to better prosecute and punish those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and serious human rights abuses. The government should also be urged to pass the necessary national legislation to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.    Recommendations on DRC We urge the Security Council mission to: Urge the command of the Interim Emergency Multinational Force to be prepared to respond to attacks against civilians outside of Bunia, where reports describe continued fighting between Hema and Lendu armed groups, including in Aru, Mongbwalu and Tchomia.  The fate of thousands of civilians who live in these areas and those who have fled from Bunia is uncertain. Strengthen the Chapter VII component of the MONUC mandate to ensure it is robust enough to protect the civilian population throughout Ituri and beyond once the Interim Emergency Intervention Force leaves on September 1. Ensure that the additional MONUC troops for Ituri are deployed in key areas in the territory and given adequate resources and logistics to deter further violence. Broaden the operational guidelines of MONUC to include deterrent and preventative actions in order to maximise the protection of civilians. Establish a team of MONUC human rights investigators in Ituri with sufficient resources to document and publicly report on violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in order to hold the perpetrators accountable for their crimes. Ensure this team is supported by a local office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights based in Bunia which can provide technical experience to the MONUC team and also strengthen local human rights organizations. Ensure that the Ugandan, Rwandan and DRC governments do not provide any military or financial assistance, including military training and ammunition, to political armed groups in Ituri with a record of human rights abuses.  This should include Lendu, Ngiti and Hema militias, groups such as the FNI, FRPI, PUSIC and the UPC, as well as the RCD-ML, RCD-N and the MLC. Establish a credible and legitimate international justice mechanism for the DRC to investigate and prosecute all parties accused of abuses from 1996 to 2002 including non-Congolese actors from Uganda, Rwanda and other states. Urge the Ugandan government to investigate and prosecute war crimes, violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed since 1999 by Ugandan troops in Ituri and local groups over which they exercised effective control. Exert pressure on the RCD-Goma to end its abuses against the civilian population and human rights activists and to permit the radio in Bukavu to resume broadcasting. Direct the staff of U.N. agencies working in eastern Congo to give priority to programs focused on the rights of women and girls, the elimination of sexual violence, and the prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS is an urgent problem.  A World Health Organization Survey in Bukavu Hospital found that 54 percent of adult females and 26 percent of children were HIV positive. Burundi During its mission to Burundi the Security Council should call on the new government to deliver on its promises to end the nine-year long war and to deliver justice for the many violations of international humanitarian law committed during the war. While the transfer of power, the signing of cease-fires, the promised deployment of an African Union peace-keeping force, the passage of laws on justice, and the infusion of foreign aid have raised hopes that the new government will succeed better than its predecessor, there are also less promising signs: conflict and violence continue throughout the country and the new laws on justice are encumbered with provisions that will slow their implementation. Addressing Impunity In several of the most serious massacres documented by Human Rights Watch, government soldiers have escaped all meaningful punishment. In a recent trial of officers accused of participating in the deliberate massacre of 173 civilians in Itaba commune, Gitega province, the military prosecutor called civilians present in a community after the passage of rebels “secondary assailants,” thus ignoring the distinction between combatant and non-combatant that is fundamental to international humanitarian law. On April 23 soldiers reportedly shot some twenty civilians fleeing combat in Kabezi commune, Bujumbura-rural. In combat zones, government troops have barred access by humanitarian agencies, leaving displaced persons without adequate food, water, or medical assistance. Rebel FDD and FNL forces have committed numerous violations of international humanitarian law. They have summarily executed civilians, some of them local administrative officials, and others, unarmed passengers in vehicles that have been ambushed on various roads throughout the country. Rebel forces have also raped and injured civilians and they have destroyed and looted civilian property. In recent months, the FDD has continued to recruit children into their armed forces. Neither of the rebel forces has announced any form of accountability or discipline for combatants guilty of violating international humanitarian law. Burundian legislators have passed several laws important for delivering justice under the new government. Both the assembly and the senate adopted a long-promised law against genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. Passage of the law marks a major step in this country that has seen large-scale ethnic slaughter in the past, but the law is encumbered with a complicated mechanism that may delay dealing with these crimes. It calls for an international judicial commission of inquiry, presumably to be created under the aegis of the United Nations, to examine crimes committed from 1962 until the date of promulgation of the law, a period of more than forty years. It also asks for an international criminal tribunal to be created to try cases of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity if the commission finds that such crimes have been committed. The assembly also proposed establishing a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to cover the same period since 1962. The assembly authorized ratification of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.  The African Mission The Special Representative of the UN Secretary General and regional leaders preside over a number of diplomatic initiatives to end the war, but the actual work of peace-keeping is to be handled by a mission of the African Union. Forty-three observers attached to the mission have arrived from Tunisia, Burkina Faso, Gabon and Togo and are deployed in several towns, although they are not traveling to combat zones for security reasons. More than one hundred South African troops arrived in Bujumbura on April 27, part of a larger peacekeeping force of 3,500 troops that will include soldiers from Mozambique and Ethiopia. The mandate of the force is only to monitor the cease-fire, leaving it unlikely that its soldiers will even endeavor to protect civilians. As yet, the force has no unit specially tasked with monitoring the human rights situation.  Recommendations on Burundi The Security Council mission should: Use its influence to urge the Burundian government to ensure its armed forces strictly abide by international humanitarian law, particularly concerning the treatment of civilians during armed conflict. Use its influence to urge the rebel forces to ensure that their forces strictly comply with international humanitarian law, particularly concerning the treatment of civilians during armed conflict. Insist upon the full and rapid implementation of provisions in the Arusha Accord of August 2000, reaffirmed by the December 2002 ceasefire agreement, including those for bringing to justice those accused of violations of international humanitarian law. Assist the Burundian government with the development of an effective system of justice. Encourage the government to ratify the Rome Treaty of the International Criminal Court without making use of the article 124 option to delay implementation of the competence of the court. Work to speed the deployment of observers and peacekeeping troops, and ensure that peacekeeping forces protect civilians and that the African Mission create a unit to monitor and report on all human rights abuses by Burundian government, rebel forces, and African Mission troops.

Congo-Burundi Mission Should Prioritize Civilian Protection","","06/06/2003","(New York) - The U.N. Security Council must focus on wartime violence against civilians in its upcoming mission to the Great Lakes region of Africa, Human Rights Watch said today. A Security Council mission to investigate recent violence will visit the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Burundi beginning tomorrow. Both countries have at least partial peace agreements in place, but combat continues with civilians as prime targets. In an open letter to the Security Council, Human Rights Watch also urged the Council to raise the need for justice for these abuses with the leaders in the region.     Human Rights Watch welcomed the recent decision of the Council to authorize a multinational force for Bunia in northeastern DRC, but raised fears about tens of thousands of civilians outside the town whose fate is unknown. In recent days, there has been renewed violence in Aru, Mongbwalu and Tchomia- all of which are areas outside the current mandate of the new force. Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to urge the interim force to be prepared to respond to such attacks against civilians.     """"Tens of thousands of civilians continue to live in fear for their lives in both Congo and Burundi,"""" said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. """"The Security Council must use its influence to stop abuses against them.""""     On Burundi, Human Rights Watch urges the Council to ensure the new Burundian government delivers on its promises to end the war and deliver justice.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/06/06/zimbabwe-declining-economic-and-political-conditions","Zimbabwe- Declining Economic and Political Conditions","Zimbabwe: Declining Economic and Political Conditions","A Human Rights Watch Briefing Paper","06/06/2003","Summary Background Political Violence  Targeted Attacks by State Security Forces Violations by Youth Militia   The Closure of Organizational Space  Legal Restrictions on Rights to Assembly and Speech The Arbitrary Enforcement of Legal Provisions   Widening the Spectrum of Targets  Civil Society Organizations Churches and the National Pastors Conference   Zimbabwe’s Obligations Under International Law Conclusions Recommendations  To the Government of Zimbabwe: To the Opposition Party: To the International Community:     Summary On March 18 and 19, 2003, Zimbabwe’s main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) requested that its supporters stay away from their workplaces in protest against declining economic and political conditions in the country. It was the first time that the MDC had called for political action since the ruling party’s victory in the March 2002 presidential elections, which were marred by widespread irregularities and incidents of violence. The independent press and the opposition party described the stayaway as a success, reporting fairly credible national observation rates of over 60%. Yet it also triggered a severe government backlash against political activity in the country. State security forces arrested over 400 activists and other citizens, and many more were violently attacked both by security forces and by ruling party militia. The government deployed large numbers of military personnel to low-income suburbs of Harare and other urban areas. Further, in the run-up to two parliamentary by-elections held on March 29 and 30, the MDC was prevented from undertaking normal campaign activities, and known party activists were detained, beaten and harassed. The reaction of the government and the security forces during these weeks illustrated a clear and systematic repression of MDC activists, which amounted to a criminalization of political affiliation. In addition to this direct repression of political activity, legislation passed prior to the presidential elections has resulted in a progressive closure of political space over the past year. Public demonstrations and protests are effectively illegal under the 2002 Public Order and Security Act (POSA), which curtails citizens’ rights to freedom of expression. Serious restrictions on citizens’ rights to assembly and association have made it difficult for elected representatives to regularly meet with their constituents - meetings are either declared illegal or are otherwise disrupted. In addition, police and youth militia have dispersed public meetings that received police clearance, private organizational meetings, and meetings of organizations that are exempt from POSA. Staff of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) say that their operations have been increasingly constrained by POSA and other legal restrictions since the 2002 presidential elections. This report, based on over three weeks of research by Human Rights Watch, finds that Zimbabwe has suffered a serious breakdown in law and order, resulting in major violations of human rights. This environment has been created largely by actions of the ranking government officials and state security forces. State-sponsored violence and repression have expanded their scope both geographically and in terms of targets over the past year. The political violence endemic in the rural areas since 2000 has now become common in urban centers, and those targeted now include non-political actors, including civic organizations and church leaders. Background The deteriorating human rights situation in Zimbabwe is the continuation of a consistent pattern of human rights abuses over the past three years. These abuses began shortly before the parliamentary elections of June 2000, and they were linked both to the rising popularity of the MDC and the February 2000 defeat of the government’s proposed new constitution in a referendum. Spontaneous as well as state-sponsored invasions of white-owned commercial farms occurred throughout 2000,1 and the government failed to take firm action against the violence and lawlessness that accompanied these invasions. Police often refused to take action or even document reports of human rights violations on occupied farms.2 Indeed, supporters of the government and of the government’s fast track land redistribution were vested with a considerable degree of impunity, an impunity that the Presidential political amnesty of October 2000 actually made official.3 The government’s actions during this period allowed the war veterans who had led the occupations of commercial farms to carve out their own zones of authority. War veterans have no official status as government officials and regularly ignore police and court directives. However, they have become increasingly involved in activities as disparate as policing, land distribution, and training of youths in the national youth service. Furthermore, the government has allowed the graduates of these training programs to monitor price controls and perform other informal policing operations, thereby creating another potential challenge to the authority of official state security forces. Clear lines of authority and jurisdiction have also been eroded by a gradual militarization of normal policing activities. The military has become increasingly involved in food distribution, electoral management, and other activities that would naturally fall under the mandate of the Zimbabwe Republic Police. The increasing disorder in this sector has created a permissive environment for continued violations of personal security and basic rights, even in the event of a substantive change in government policy. That is, even if the ruling party commits itself to a restoration of peace and order in Zimbabwe, its ability to ensure the compliance of its supporting structures is uncertain. The severity of human rights abuses has increased, and the direct involvement of formal state institutions in such abuses marks a new and dangerous development in Zimbabwe’s ongoing political crisis. Previously, war veterans, youth militia, and ruling party activists had been responsible for most of the violence and intimidation of opposition party supporters. Interviews in March and April of this year established that violent human rights violations are being carried out by uniformed army and police personnel. Further, the government has taken no clear action to halt the rising incidence of torture and mistreatment of suspects while in the custody of police or intelligence services. As in the past, repression of political activity and expression of dissent have been particularly noticeable prior to election periods. However, as economic and political conditions deteriorate, the government seems increasingly willing to directly involve itself in human rights abuses. The government has become more vulnerable as a result of the deterioration of economic conditions in Zimbabwe - a situation that has been compounded by the lack of corn, gasoline and other basic commodities. The economy contracted by an estimated 12% percent during 2002.4 Minimum wages set by government are less than a third of the amount needed by a family of six to meet basic needs. The Consumer Council of Zimbabwe estimates that the amount needed by a low-income family of six to purchase a basic expenditure """"basket"""" was Z$88,578 in February 2003 (US$104 at the official rate, US$68 at the parallel rate)5; however, the government minimum wage in March for an unskilled or semi-skilled worker in the formal sector was approximately Z$23,000 a month (US$27 or $18 in March). 6 Inflation has surpassed 220% per annum, and it is estimated that unemployment exceeds 70% of the workforce.  Political Violence In the weeks following the MDC-organized stayaway of March 17 and 18, Zimbabwe experienced a massive wave of arrests including the arrests of five MPs on suspicion of organizing the stayaway.7 Those in custody were denied adequate food and the right to legal counsel and were subjected to beatings and torture. A large number of those arrested were released after forty-eight hours detention without any formal charge, indicating that police are often arresting without sufficient grounds or legal standing. 8 According to some ruling party Members of Parliament and other officials, the violence that occurred during this period was perpetrated by supporters of both the ruling party and the opposition.9 These individuals mentioned government reports of attacks by MDC activists against those who did not wish to participate in the stayaway, as well as several episodes of property destruction that occurred during the stayaway. However, these same officials suggested that either they themselves or others intervened when necessary to prevent charges being filed against “our youths” (their supporters). When asked, ruling party members agreed that there was unequal application of the law and police discrimination against MDC supporters. Many of those interviewed by HRW reported that informal curfews had been established in several areas and had been in place for more than two weeks. Areas in and around Harare that were reported to be most affected by curfews, security roadblocks, and military deployment included Chitungwiza, Mabvuku, Glen View, and Kuwadzana. There were also reports of large numbers of youth militia in Mbare. Other suburbs were also affected, though perhaps less intensively or for shorter periods of time.10 Residents in Kuwadzana and Highfield reported an increased presence of youth militia and military personnel in the week preceding the parliamentary by-elections in these constituencies. The Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network (ZESN) suggested that the low turnout in these constituencies as compared to the 2000 and 2002 elections was due to the climate of intimidation and fear fostered by military and militia presence prior to the election. In a preliminary press statement following the closure of the polls, ZESN reported that “the actual polling days were characterized by vote buying, violence, abductions of observers and party polling agents, intimidation, denial of access to the polling stations to accredited observers, and a heavy presence of the uniformed forces and ZANU PF youths in the vicinity of the polling stations.”11 There were serious restrictions on residents’ mobility throughout this period, as commuter transport was stopped at roadblocks and commuters were required to produce identification. Residents reported that these roadblocks and nighttime patrolling by military and militia made them fearful for their personal safety. One Highfield resident commented: “By 6 o’clock [on the first day of voting] we were all inside. We had seen the military moving around, and everyone knew what was going to happen if you were on the streets. Men weren’t even drinking by the bottle store.”12 Targeted Attacks by State Security Forces Human Rights Watch conducted the bulk of the research for this report in Harare but also consulted with human rights workers in urban centers nationwide. The largest numbers of reports of arrests and violence came from Harare, but similar patterns of targeted attacks against MDC members and supporters were observed in other urban areas. Human rights abuses in March 2003 demonstrated a significant degree of planning and coordination. Security forces possessed good information on MDC members and their movements. They would sometimes ask those they were beating for the location of particular individuals; and even if they did not get this information, revealed they already knew the answer.13 It seems that targeted attacks on MDC activists were perpetrated by members of the military or, possibly, by members of the Law and Order section of the police forces, who wear uniforms similar to army camouflage. Both military and the Law and Order section personnel drive green vehicles without license plates, which are the vehicles that victims and witnesses reported seeing driving around the low-income suburbs. Noting the time lags and similarities between incidents, one human rights worker speculated that a single unit of the military may have been put together to undertake these special assignments.14 Several victims told Human Rights Watch that perpetrators had a patch reading “commando” or “commando unit” on their uniforms.15 It is difficult to determine how many of the hundreds of detentions of MDC activists in March-April were accompanied by the kind of physical brutality that some victims described. However, it is clear that violent attacks by official state security personnel were systematic and widespread, particularly in the high-density suburbs. In most cases, “suspects” were not taken to police stations, and charges were neither filed nor mentioned to the individuals. The attacks by state security forces were very brutal. In addition to beating victims with blunt objects, police and army personnel burned victims with cigarettes, forced them to drink poison, urine or other toxic liquids, sexually assaulted them with blunt objects, and beat individuals on the soles of their feet. There was no distinction made between family members of suspects and the suspects themselves. In some cases, it seems that family members were brutalized either to punish suspects or in the hopes of extracting information. In other cases, family members were mistaken for suspects or were thought to be hiding them. When security forces arrived at the house of a MDC activist two days after the stayaway, for instance, they mistook the suspect’s mother for her. The attack on the mother did not stop once the activist identified herself: “I heard my mother screaming from inside my room, so I came out. Unfortunately, I had a poster of Morgan [Tsvangirai, MDC President] on my wall, and when they saw it they went crazy. They started beating me with a cord and broken hosepipes, and they were yelling and calling me names. I saw the piece of cloth my mother was wearing had fallen down, and they were beating her. And they made her part her legs, and they put the AK inside her.”16 Both the MDC activist interviewed and her brother, also a member of party structures, were eventually taken away in state vehicles. She reported that she was beaten and burned with cigarette butts on her hands and arms while they interrogated her about MDC plans for mass action. After some hours, she was released without being taken to a police station or charged with any offense. Medical personnel who treated her and her mother at a private clinic in Harare confirmed that their injuries were consistent with this account. Members of the household of an MDC MP told a similar story, though this attack took place after the Kuwadzana and Highfield by-elections.17 Security personnel arrived at their house at around midnight in an armed group of about fifteen. Household members said that the MP was out of the country, but the “soldiers” accused them of lying and began beating the three male members of the household with sjamboks (whips) and baton sticks. The leader of the group told one victim that the military “will clean the whole of Chitungwiza and go to every MDC house.”18 Security personnel left after stealing basic commodities, a registered gun kept in the household, a cellphone, a car radio, Z$200 000 (US $236 or $154 in March), and some cans of paint. Two household members volunteered physical descriptions of the perpetrators to Human Rights Watch. Individuals living in these low-income suburbs will often initially deny having witnessed any arrests or incidents of political violence. After assurances of confidentiality, some admit that they have witnessed several events but say that they keep quiet for fear of being associated with the opposition and victimized themselves.19 With regard to late-night arrests or assaults by security personnel, “of course [residents] hear the noise, but no one would come out. They just sit and listen. Yesterday we had someone in [for treatment] who was beaten for looking through her window at what was going on.”20 In areas seen to be MDC strongholds, civilians with no links to the opposition party or to activist organizations have also been assaulted, sometimes with the aim of obtaining information. A fifteen-year-old girl residing in Chitungwiza told the following story:21 A few days after the Harare by-elections, she was returning to the gate of her sister’s house at around 9:30 at night, carrying a bag of clothing, when a large group of men in camouflage approached her. She thought they were soldiers, but they began beating her with batons and demanding names of MDC members and where such members met. She repeatedly told them her age, arguing that she was too young to know about such things, but they continued to beat and threaten her. She eventually told them that the MDC met at a particular school, and they left, taking with them her bag of clothes. Another woman, also with no links to politics, reported that “soldiers with black berets” pointed a gun at her head and demanded information about Job Sikhala (MDC MP for St. Mary’s). She was then thrown on the ground, beaten, and jumped upon. They left her in the road after robbing her house of Z$35,000 (US $41 or $27 in March).22 The government justifies the deployment of large numbers of military personnel to residential areas, saying that such actions are necessary in order to preserve law and order. In an interview withthe Sunday Mail, Information Minister Jonathan Moyo defended the deployment of military in high-density residential areas by stating: “It would be foolhardy to deploy only the police to deal with such terrorists. Terrorism in a constitutional democracy requires a military response and where the military is deployed nobody should expect a picnic because throwing petrol bombs at civilians and placing dynamite under bridges and in buildings is just not a picnic.”23 During the stayaway, two commuter vehicles were damaged with petrol bombs, and physical property was also damaged in an urban area. Government has arrested dozens of individuals in connection with these events, but it has not presented any evidence establishing the identity of the perpetrators or the involvement of MDC officials or MPs in ordering such destruction.  Violations by Youth Militia The increasing involvement of Zanu PF youth militia -- also known as “green bombers” due to the color of the uniforms they wear -- has also contributed to the breakdown of law and order and to increasing violence. The militia is composed of graduates of the Border Gezi National Training Centers; the first of these was established in Mashonaland Central (Mt Darwin), and several more have been opened in Matabeleland North and South, Midlands and Masvingo. The government has announced its intention to open 35 centers nationwide, which explains the rapid increase in the program’s budget allocation from Z$418 million in 2002 to Z$2 billion in 2003.24 Youths are induced to join the programs with promises of jobs, and the government has also made the youth service a prerequisite for entrance into the military, police, and the public university system. The program ostensibly teaches youths entrepreneurial and vocational skills, but the activities of youth militia who have been deployed to communities suggest that they have received military training and instruction in torture. After graduation, the youths are deployed to different areas of the country to serve as Zanu PF militia. They set up informal roadblocks, monitor and violently harass those suspected of being MDC supporters, and ensure compliance with government-gazetted price controls.25 The youth militia have been implicated in several acts of violence, torture, and property destruction in rural areas, and Zimbabwean human rights organizations documented an increasing proportion of political violence being associated with these groups in the run-up to the presidential elections.26 The presence of youth militia in the urban areas noticeably increased in the latter portion of 2002, particularly in Harare and Bulawayo. By mid-January, there were reports that youth militia had set up bases in several locations in the Kuwadzana constituency, including a city council building and a shopping center.27 There was also an increasing number of attacks against vendors accused of hoarding basic commodities or selling them for more than the ticketed price. Witnesses and victims of these attacks report that sugar and other basic commodities were then “confiscated” by the youth militia, often in plain sight of police officers. The youth militia are suspected of selling the stolen goods on the parallel market.28 Youth militia have been involved in violent attacks on those suspected of opposition party loyalties. These attacks are much less targeted than those perpetrated by state security forces, and they are also more likely to affect bystanders. During attacks, police have not interfered with the activities of the militia. In one incident, a twenty-one-year-old social activist said that he was grabbed by youth militia two days after the stayaway in a township of Harare.29 He believes his abduction was a case of mistaken identity. The militia demanded to look inside his bag, in which he had some fliers about a “people’s initiative” not linked with the MDC. Upon finding this material, they began to beat him with whips and they stole his cell phone and other personal possessions. Police passed by while he was being beaten and made no attempt to interfere. After three hours, he was taken to the police station, but he heard the youths continue to make statements about killing him. He paid bribes to two police officers to make the youths leave. He was taken to another police station and was then released without charges twelve hours later. Other victims interviewed by HRW told similar stories. The Closure of Organizational Space Since 2000, NGOs and church organizations have found it more and more difficult to operate in areas considered to be politically volatile or off-limits, particularly rural areas. Moreover, the combination of increasingly restrictive legislation and repression by security forces or informal actors has resulted in further constraints on basic liberties since the presidential elections of 2002. Lawyers and NGOs indicate that there are two dimensions to the crisis of law and order in Zimbabwe: (1) the increasingly repressive legal climate and (2) problems associated with selective enforcement or “excessive” enforcement due to the politicization of state security institutions. Legal Restrictions on Rights to Assembly and Speech The government passed two major pieces of legislation before the presidential elections, the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) and the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA), that severely limit criticism of government and public debate. Of these legal changes, the introduction of POSA has had the most immediate and the most negative impact on human rights conditions in the country. The Act prohibits a broad spectrum of speech acts, including any public statements that would be “likely to undermine public confidence” in the police and other state institutions, as well as any statements likely to engender “feelings of hostility” towards the President.30 The vagueness of the language regarding prohibited speech makes the Act capable of being extended to almost any expression of personal belief and is, on its face and in its application a direct violation of Zimbabwe’s obligations to uphold freedom of expression under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which the country has been a party since 1991.31 POSA’s restrictions on public meetings are also detrimental to the rights of Zimbabwean citizens to freedom of expression, association and assembly. POSA requires the organizers of a public meeting to inform local police of the meeting four days in advance. In order to preserve public order, police are given the authority to change the venue or other logistical aspects of the meeting, prohibit the meeting entirely, or prohibit all public meetings in a particular police district for up to three months. These sections of POSA have been used to shut down several public meetings, including those held by elected MDC officials to report back to their constituencies.32 The police do not provide clear reasons why meetings are considered threats to public order and do not suggest conditions under which the meetings could be held. In practice, any meeting organized by opposition party members or civil society organizations is presumed to threaten public order. The same presumption does not apply to meetings organized by ruling party supporters. The freedoms of expression and association have also been curtailed by AIPPA, which requires the registration with government of all journalists and media houses.33 Journalists operating without licenses are subject to heavy fines and imprisonment. These restrictions on journalism have recently been applied to non-journalists collecting information for other purposes. In one case, four Lutheran aid workers were arrested under AIPPA and held for several days in their hotel without formal charges.34 The government seems prepared to go further to limit speech critical of government: a recent Ministry of Foreign Affairs order bans foreign diplomats from making speeches at their national day events.35 The Private Voluntary Organizations Act of 1996 requires all organizations that provide welfare services or treatment or “any activities that uplift the standard of living of persons of families” to register with the government. Registration is not automatic, and the government has a right to deny an organization’s right to exist after examining its books and records. Until recently, this last provision had not been enforced, but in November 2002, Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa announced in Parliament that all organizations not registered under the PVO Act should immediately cease operations or face arrests. NGOs reported that they were particularly concerned about amendments to the Act, currently being drafted by government, which would further strengthen government control over NGO operations.36 The Arbitrary Enforcement of Legal Provisions The detrimental effects of constraints placed upon political and civil rights by the government legislation are compounded by irregular, selective, and “excessive” enforcement.37 Tactics used by police and other security forces include the arrest of political and civil society activists on criminal charges without credible evidence, the use of torture during interrogation, and the arrest or beating of those associated with the accused, such as family members, without any evidence of wrong-doing on their part. The police have loosely interpreted POSA to place restrictions on a broader category of activities and actors. There is also a pattern of arresting individuals, holding them for the maximum 48 hours and then releasing them without charge. Interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch suggest that police often do not have a particular charge or infraction in mind when arresting members of the public. Some don’t even make an attempt to justify detentions: one victim of a severe beating by youth militia was told by police that they had been directed, “if you find anyone with MDC or any organization, just take them and hold them until August.”38 Arbitrary detention is not merely practiced against political activists or MDC officials. For instance, one trade unionist reported that he had been arrested after the holding of a public meeting to discuss labor issues.39 He had not addressed the meeting, and he asked on what charges he was being held. The arresting officers and their superiors said he had violated POSA - “all arrests are now under POSA,” they stated - but they refused to furnish a section number or a specific accusation. In addition to detention without charges, scores more have been arrested, charged, assigned bail, and then told that the police would “proceed by way of summons.” Rarely are these charges pursued. Individuals so charged told HRW that they felt intimidated by these tactics, and they said that the pending charges put restrictions on their ability to plan and their freedom of movement. “They don’t come for a long time, but if you then ask about the charges, they tell you to go away and wait to be summoned. So you’re always thinking, if I do this thing or if I say that, will it make them pick me up? It’s like there’s a shadow over your head.”40 The non-pursuit of charges may be due to the questionable legality of most of the arrests. Human Rights Watch interviewed over ten individuals who were arrested under sections of POSA with which they had either complied or from which they were exempted. For instance, the Peace-building Subcommittee of Crisis in Zimbabwe, which includes several religious organizations, informed police in advance of a meeting to be held on February 18th 2003. Subcommittee members, many of whom were from church organizations, arrived at the church to find a large group of riot police who informed them that the meeting would not take place.41 After a short dialogue with police about an usher he was supposed to drive home, one of the participants was assaulted by the police and told that he would be arrested under POSA. He was handcuffed and hit several times by the presiding officer. As the police were transporting the suspect to the police station, they stopped at an adjoining restaurant and arrested five attendees from the meeting on charges under POSA, though there seemed no basis for the arrests. Among those arrested were Bishop Trevor Manhanga of the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, one of the three largest umbrella church organizations in Zimbabwe.42 Widening the Spectrum of Targets The extreme state of societal polarization in the country has blurred lines between political and civic activity. The government has come to see many organizations, particularly those in the realm of human rights and governance, as associated with or even part of the opposition party. Over the past six months, the government has explicitly refused to recognize the stated non-partisan nature of these organizations. The state-owned press has published several reports alleging that domestic NGOs and church organizations were under the control of foreign interests or were pursuing activities intended to undermine national security and order within the country. Many of these organizations receive funding from the UK Department for International Development and the US Agency for International Development, as well as other donor organizations and private foundations. Zimbabwean NGOs report that this hostile environment has resulted in direct constraints on activities or in the compromising of some programs in order to continue operating.43 For instance, the Legal Resources Foundation has reported that its paralegals eliminated or substantially changed the content of programs on the constitution and the declaration of rights in 2002, even though there was still strong demand for these programs.44 Similarly, the Association of Women’s Clubs (AWC) decided to formally halt its programs on voter education, women’s legal rights, and human rights issues because of fears of intimidation.45 Civil Society Organizations The PVO Act detailed above has been used to seriously constrain the activities of Amani Trust, an organization formed in 1993 to treat and rehabilitate victims of torture and organized violence.46 It is registered as a trust with the High Court, which excludes it from the provisions of the PVO Act.47 The organization has provided assistance to liberation war veterans suffering from trauma, provided testimony to a government commission investigating war veterans’ compensation claims in 1997, and has conducted training programs on torture and trauma in association with the Ministry of Health. However, by mid-2000, Amani was mostly providing treatment and support to former farmworkers, political activists, and those accused of being MDC sympathizers, simply because these groups composed the bulk of victims. In 2000-2001, Amani set up safehouses in urban centers to house the many who were internally displaced due to violence. It also released several reports documenting abuses and reporting the names of perpetrators.48 At around this time, stories in the state press reported that Amani was funded by the British government, that it was publishing false reports, and that it was allowing the safehouses to be used as bases for MDC “terrorist” operations. Following the release of Amani documentation on rapes at national youth training facilities and by war veterans, police, and youth militia, attacks against Amani in the government-owned press increased.49 At the beginning of September, the government gave Amani notice that it should cease operations until it was formally registered under the PVO Act, legislation to which it would be exempt due to its registration as a trust. The organization closed its offices in mid-November after threats of arrests in the state-owned press and in Parliament.50 Other organizations have been systematically harassed using the provisions of POSA, specifically those like the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA) that have continued to organize protests and public meetings over the past year.51 The NCA has had its national offices subjected to police searches five times from January 2002 to the present.52 On these occasions, police told NCA officials that they were suspected of possession of subversive materials, organizing public violence, or conspiracy to commit an offense. Police seized donor files, financial records, civic and voter education materials, and NCA T-shirts.53 The most recent raid of the NCA offices occurred two days after the MDC-sponsored stayaway of March 18-19. On Friday, March 21, a large group of armed police arrived at the NCA headquarters to arrest NCA officers on suspicion of helping to organize the stayaway. According to a staff member, all of those present, male and female, were forced to lie on their stomachs on the lawn and were beaten with baton sticks.54 The eighteen men present at the offices, including several members who had come from provincial offices to attend an evaluation workshop, were then taken to the police station and detained until Monday, March 24, without food or access to legal advice. They were then released without charges. Churches and the National Pastors Conference Following the presidential elections, the religious community in Zimbabwe was increasingly split between those groups openly critical of government’s human rights record and those that were more muted in their criticism. Many church officials indicated to Human Rights Watch that there was a deepening crisis in the church as economic conditions worsened in the country as a whole and attacks against pastors in the rural areas continued. These officials felt that the main church bodies - the Zimbabwe Council of Churches, the Catholic Bishops Conference, and the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe - were not vocal enough, and a large number of pastors began to feel that it was immoral to remain quiet. One pastor said he was apolitical but felt “a religious obligation to bear witness. There’s no way you can be a Christian in this environment and turn a blind eye to what is taking place.”55 The National Pastors Conference, under the auspices of the inter-denominational Ecumenical Support Services (ESS), was formed in February 2002 to provide for pastors who were forced out of their parishes by political violence. Before and during 2002, the attacks on religious bodies were perpetrated by non-state actors, such as war vets and party activists, after pastors had performed funerals or provided other services to MDC supporters. By 2003, there was a feeling within the National Pastors Conference that the intimidation of pastors was coming from the state security institutions themselves.56 There were few incidents of meetings being halted in 2002, but in rural areas, workshops and other church functions are always attended by members of the intelligence services, who sometimes even introduce themselves.57 Individuals from several different denominations and church organizations said that relations between the government and the churches were in rapid decline by early 2003. In the run-up to the by-elections in Kuwadzana and Highfields, police and youth militia forcibly dispersed a “Crusade,” a legally permitted prayer meeting, citing POSA.58 Some church leaders saw the police interference and arrests at the 13th February Northside Christian Church meeting as the last straw. Members of the religious community noted that the meeting had initially been cleared by the police, and they felt that its cancellation showed that the government now saw church meetings as political. Said one official, “The feeling was, if we don’t act now, they’ll shut down all our meetings.”59 The Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, Ecumenical Support Services, the National Pastors Conference, and the Peace-building Sub-committee of Crisis in Zimbabwe organized a small march for Friday February 28, 2003. Those involved in the march were a small group of twenty three church leaders and pastors. They left the offices of the Evangelical Support Services in Harare at around 11am with a petition that they were going to present to the Commissioner of Police protesting police intimidation and arbitrary arrest.60 Before reaching the police headquarters, two trucks full of riot police arrived, and the police were singing “you’ve chosen to be beaten.” The group was held all day at the central police station without food or legal counsel before being charged under section 24 of POSA, even though religious groups are exempt from this section. To date, the police have not pursued these charges. However, some of the pastors involved in the march have faced harassment and intimidation. One pastor said he had never had any direct experience with political victimization prior to this year. After participating in the February 28th march, he began to receive strange phone calls. The callers refused to identify themselves, and they told him to meet them at particular locations or they would “come and take [him] by force.”61 Another pastor whose parish was located in a communal area has faced more severe harassment and intimidation.62 After a series of visits from unidentified men and threatening phone calls, he took his family into Harare to stay and returned to his parish only during the day. Another pastor confirmed that the deterioration of church-state relations was also occurring in the provinces.63 Prior to the past few months, the Manicaland Church Forum, an inter-denominational organization committed to peace building, had been meeting regularly with all provincial MPs from both the ruling party and the opposition. Toward the end of 2002, there was a feeling that peace-building programs needed to be expanded nationwide and embrace a larger number of people, including the police. As part of these efforts, a member of the Forum presented a paper at a January conference suggesting that Zimbabwe may need a Truth and Reconciliation Commission at some point. Shortly thereafter, he was arrested under POSA and interrogated for two and a half hours by members of the CIO. He posted bail and was released; charges have not been pursued. Since that time, the Manicaland Church Forum has not been holding meetings, and the dialogue that the church had with government and ruling party MPs has ceased. Zimbabwe’s Obligations Under International Law The systematic and arbitrary arrests of dissidents and the acts of torture described in this report violate international law. As a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),64 Zimbabwe has a duty to pass and enforce laws that protect its citizens against unwarranted intrusion by its security forces. POSA violates Zimbabwe’s international obligations. The ICCPR specifically guarantees a right to freely express one’s opinions and beliefs. Article 19 reads:  “Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds . . . through any other media of his choice.”65  Two particular sections of POSA allow for interpretations that would easily violate Zimbabwe’s obligation to allow freedom of expression under the ICCPR. Section 15 prohibits speech likely to “undermin[e] public confidence in a law enforcement agency, the Prison Service or the Defense Forces of Zimbabwe.”66 Section 16 prohibits any speech with the possibility of “engendering feelings of hostility towards; or causing hatred, contempt or ridicule of the President . . . whether in person or in respect of his office;” punishable by up to $20,000 (US $24) in fines or a year in prison. Further, any “indecent, obscene or false statement about or concerning the President” is also punishable under this section of POSA.67 Authorities use the broad language of Sections 15 and 16 of POSA to target members of the MDC and other opposition groups critical of the government. They manipulate the meaning of POSA and AIPPA, granting almost unlimited authority to stamp out unwanted voices. The Zimbabwean Supreme Court recently ruled a section of AIPPA unconstitutional. Section 80 (1)(b) read with 80 (2) referring to publishing falsehoods violates Section 20 (1) of Zimbabwe’s constitution, which guarantees unfettered freedom of expression.68 Groups supporting the ruling argued that its limited scope left other abusive provisions in AIPPA intact, but they generally applauded the ruling. The government has declared that it is “under siege” and will continue using POSA to restrict MDC activities, in order to maintain order and the legitimacy of the current government.69 Article 21 of the ICCPR states:  “The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”70  Arbitrary arrest is also strictly forbidden. Article 9 states:  “Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention. No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedures as are established by law.”71 “Anyone who is arrested shall be informed, at the time of arrest, of the reasons for his arrest and shall be promptly informed of any charges against him.”72  The UN Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials requires restraint, even in times of domestic tension. “In the performance of their duty, law enforcement officials shall respect and protect human dignity and maintain and uphold the human rights of all persons. . . . [They] may use force only when strictly necessary and to the extent required for the performance of their duty.”73 The Code forbids torture, corruption, and mistreatment of detained persons as well.74 When it became a party to the ICCPR, Zimbabwe agreed to “take the necessary steps . . . to adopt such laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant.75 The ICCPR specifically guarantees equality before the law “without any discrimination . . . on any ground . . . [against] political or other opinion[s].” Zimbabwean authorities abrogate their duties as a party to the ICCPR when they arbitrarily arrest, beat and intimidate MDC opposition. Conclusions By failing to act strongly against the perpetrators of violence, by enlisting state institutions to beat and harass those perceived to be critical of government, by using rhetoric that relies on metaphors of war and terrorism, the Zimbabwean government has created a culture of impunity, intolerance, and injustice. The dismantling of this culture is necessary before Zimbabwe can begin political and economic recovery. The government of Zimbabwe is directly responsible for only some of the human rights violations in the country. Even where there are open questions about the degree of control exercised over war veterans and youth militia, it still remains responsible for their actions. There are also credible reports of violence and intimidation by MDC activists and youth. However, as one ruling party MP admitted, “when you ask who has the capacity to stop [the violence], if it had the will, the answer is government.”76 Due to economic conditions and the increasing levels of violence, Zimbabwe is currently facing a particularly volatile political situation. The continuation of current levels of polarization will impede the restoration of basic rights and security. Indeed, the evidence presented above suggests a potential for continued erosion, perhaps at an accelerated pace, of human rights conditions within the country. It is imperative the Zimbabwean government to take credible measures to reduce tension within the country and to repair the reputation of state institutions. From this standpoint, recent efforts by regional actors to revive dialogue between government and opposition are a positive step toward normalization of politics inside the country. However, in order for such efforts to result in substantive improvement in human rights conditions in Zimbabwe, the Zimbabwean government must undo the damage wrought by persistent patterns of human rights abuse and the impunity that has accompanied them. This will require greater tolerance of political pluralism, greater transparency and accountability in government policy-making, and the arrest and trial of those responsible for gross human rights violations. Recommendations To the Government of Zimbabwe:  Reestablish the rule of law by making law and order operations, including the interrogation of suspects, the sole domain of the Zimbabwe Republic Police. Disband the youth militia and shut down training bases established under the Zimbabwe National Youth Training Program. Withdraw military personnel from residential neighborhoods, especially those with upcoming elections, and limit military presence in urban centers. Arrest and prosecute those responsible for gross human rights violations. Reaffirm the government’s commitment to due process and equal treatment under the law. Ensure that the police cease the use of detention without charges, torture, and selective enforcement. Investigate citizens’ claims of torture by the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO). Encourage a climate of tolerance and mutual respect for differing political opinions. Cease inflammatory rhetoric, including tacit approval of violence, in the public press, at public rallies and state events. Allow elected representatives to meet with constituents without restriction, and ensure the safety and freedom of the opposition party to peacefully campaign prior to elections. Ensure the revision of existing legislation that constrains Zimbabwean citizens’ ability to exercise basic rights, in accordance with international standards. In particular, repeal those sections of POSA that criminalize public meetings of a political nature and criticism of office-holders and government actions.     To the Opposition Party:  Reaffirm the party’s commitment to non-violence and tolerance. Investigate claims of political violence, coerced participation, and threats by MDC activists during the March 18-19 stayaway. Direct all party members to avoid violence, retaliatory action, or actions intended to intimidate or force cooperation. Encourage a climate of tolerance and mutual respect for differing political opinions. Cease the use of inflammatory rhetoric at public rallies and campaign meetings.     To the International Community:  Continue toinsist upon the immediate reintroduction of the rule of law and the cessation of the use of arbitrary detention as well as beatings and other forms of torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and targeting of opposition and civil society activists. Urge the Zimbabwean government to revoke those elements of domestic law that contradict or are applied contrary to international law and infringe the basic rights of Zimbabwean citizens. Urge all actors to respect the human rights of all parties and to abjure the use of violence and intimidation. Support ongoing efforts by regional actors to facilitate a quick resolution of Zimbabwe’s political and human rights impasse.     1 For analysis of the human rights violations that accompanied the government’s 2000-2002 fast-track land program, see Human Rights Watch, “Fast Track Land Reform in Zimbabwe,” March 2002. 2 Weekly situation reports of the Commercial Farmers Union, 2000-2001.

Amnesty International and other human rights organization saw this clemency as a direct cause of continued human rights violations in the country. See Amnesty International, “Zimbabwe: the Toll of Impunity,” June 25, 2002. 4 UN Relief and Recovery Unit, “Humanitarian Situation Report,” 13 January 2003. 5 The value of Zimbabwean dollar had been artificially maintained at ZW$55 to the US$ until February 2003, when government devalued the dollar to $847 to the US$. Because of the shortage of foreign exchange in the country, a thriving parallel market has arisen that is perhaps a more accurate measure of the Zimbabwean dollar’s value. In March 2003, the ZW$ was trading on this market for approximately $1200 to $1350 to the US$. 6 Cited in Fews-net, """"Zimbabwe Monthly Food Security Update"""" March 26, 2003, available at www.fews.net.  7 Information provided by the MDC, correspondence, April 2003. 8 HRW interview with Geoffrey Feltoe, University of Zimbabwe, Harare, May 2003.

The Indonesian military has prohibited most international observers from visiting Aceh since the conflict reignited two weeks ago, making it difficult to confirm reported abuses by both the military and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM).  Human Rights Watch has recently received reports of extrajudicial executions by Indonesian forces, of plans by the Indonesian military to forcibly relocate large numbers of Acehnese, and of a wave of school burnings across the province. Human Rights Watch urges both sides to seek a solution to the conflict that respects the basic rights of the civilian population.  """"It is predictable that human rights abuses will get worse in an armed conflict out of the public eye,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"If there is nothing to hide, Indonesia should immediately allow free access to Aceh. Given the terrible record of both the Indonesian military and GAM, the fate of civilians in Aceh today is a serious worry.""""  Human Rights Watch urged both sides to respect international humanitarian and human rights law in the conflict, and expressed concern about reports of imminent shortages of food and medicine. Both sides are obliged under international law to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance into areas under their control. Thus far, the Indonesian government has insisted that humanitarian aid be handed over to it for delivery.  """"The Indonesian government should allow experienced international organizations to get on with their work of distributing relief,"""" said Adams.  Indonesian non-governmental organizations have been threatened for reporting abuses. Lists of activists alleged to be sympathetic to GAM have been drawn up. Government officials have threatened to charge them with subversion, which carries the death penalty. Local phone service has been disrupted. The main highway from Medan to Aceh is now controlled by a series of military checkpoints. The few independent journalists in Aceh fear that they may soon be expelled by the Indonesian authorities in retaliation for reporting abuses by Indonesian forces.  Senior Indonesian military officers have made public statements urging an aggressive, all-out war to """"crush"""" GAM. Others, however, have insisted upon the protection of human rights.  """"It is important for Indonesian authorities to speak with one voice on the protection of human rights,"""" said Adams. """"This conflict will be a big test for the Indonesian military, which hasn't shown much regard for the laws of war in the past.""""  Human Rights Watch also welcomed the recent announcement of military justice proceedings against a group of soldiers for beating civilians.  """"It would be a big step forward for the Indonesian military if genuine prosecutions are conducted,"""" said Adams. """"The world will be watching to see if this becomes the norm or is just a public relations stunt. If this becomes part of the military culture, Indonesia may be able to avoid a repetition of the painful and embarrassing process of trials for senior military officers that it is now going through for abuses committed in East Timor.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the international community to remain engaged on Aceh. """"It is vital that the United States, Japan, and the European Union that have worked very hard to avoid renewed warfare in Aceh, continue to seek a rights-respecting solution to the conflict,"""" said Adams.  After a six-month ceasefire, on May 19, the Indonesian government authorized a military solution to the longstanding conflict in Indonesia's northwestern Aceh province.

In testimony delivered today before the U.S. Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), the executive director of the Human Rights Watch Europe and Central Asia Division, Elizabeth Andersen, said that the Serbian government should demonstrate stronger commitment to the rule of law, including a genuine commitment to establishing accountability for war crimes.  Since 2000, the U.S. Congress has been adopting an annual list of reforms required of Serbia to avoid a cut-off of U.S. economic assistance. Humanitarian and democracy aid is exempted from the conditionality. Human Rights Watch said that Section 578 of the U.S. Foreign Operations Appropriations Act has been singularly effective, because it specifically identifies required reform, sets a deadline, and backs it up with clear consequences for inaction. The law identifies cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), the rule of law, and respect for minority rights, as priority areas for progress.  “In the past year, the Serbian government has made some progress on cooperation with the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal and accountability for war-time atrocities,” said Andersen. “But it still lacks clear political leadership to ensure that all those responsible for war crimes are held accountable.”  Human Rights Watch listed the following benchmarks of progress and urged the U.S. government to consider the extent to which they have been satisfied in connection with any decision on certification:  Arrest of former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic and commitments to apprehend all indictees remaining in the territory of Serbia and Montenegro within one year.  Confirmation from the Prosecutor of the ICTY that she is receiving full cooperation with ICTY document requests.  Adoption of the draft law on war crime trials and a commitment to urgently adopt a comprehensive and effective witness protection law. Issuance of indictments or other concrete and verifiable evidence of progress on domestic investigations into prominent alleged war crimes, including Batajnica (mass graves in Belgrade’s suburbs, containing some 500 bodies of Kosovo Albanians killed in 1999). Urgent changes in the law on organized crime to prohibit incommunicado detention and otherwise bring the law in compliance with Council of Europe standards.

The Liberian president was attending peace talks in Ghana when the indictment was """"unsealed."""" The indictment charges Taylor with """"bearing the greatest responsibility"""" for war crimes (murder, taking hostages); crimes against humanity (extermination, rape, murder, sexual slavery); and other serious violations of international humanitarian law (use of child soldiers) in Sierra Leone. """"Charles Taylor is one of the single greatest causes of spreading wars in West Africa,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"His indictment is a tremendous step forward, but his arrest would be even better.""""  The Sierra Leone Special Court approved the indictment on March 7, but it has been sealed since then, and only made public today. A warrant for Taylor's arrest has been served on the Ghanaian authorities and sent to Interpol.  Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Security Council to address the security situation in Monrovia, which is likely to decline in the wake of the indictment.  The indictment alleges that Taylor provided training and helped finance the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), led by Foday Sankoh, in preparation for RUF armed action in Sierra Leone and during the subsequent armed conflict in Sierra Leone. It also alleges that Taylor acted in concert with members of the RUF/Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) rebel alliance who are accused of horrific crimes.  Rebel leaders who have been supported by Taylor, including RUF leader Sam """"Mosquito"""" Bockarie, have also been linked to recent abuses against civilians in western Côte d'Ivoire. Bockarie was reportedly killed by Taylor last month. The last indicted individual who remains at large, Johnny Paul Koroma, is believed to be still in Liberia despite calls for Taylor to turn him over to the Special Court.  """"The indictment against Taylor sends a strong message that no one is above the law when it comes to accountability for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and serious violations of international humanitarian law,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Charles Taylor should not be immune from prosecution for these crimes simply because he is the president of Liberia.""""  The Special Court's Statute and implementing legislation specifically provide that official capacity is no defense to arrest or prosecution. The statutes for the Rwanda and Yugoslav Tribunals and the International Criminal Court similarly bar immunity based on official position, reflecting the increasing trend by international courts to bring officials to justice for war crimes, crimes against humanity and violations of international humanitarian law, even while they are still in office.  The Special Court was established by agreement between the United Nations and Sierra Leone and is designed to function for three years.

Last week, the government announced that it would deploy paramilitary forces to combat a deadly crime wave of the past several months. Dhaka police chief Ashraful Huda told reporters that police have been directed to """"shoot-at-sight"""" in self-defense or to protect the security of others.  """"Using the term 'shoot-at-sight' is the wrong message for senior government officials to give to police officers, because it will inevitably be abused,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"A crime wave does not justify law enforcement that does not observe basic standards of due process.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the government to ensure that its anti-crime activities are carried out in strict compliance with the United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. Where the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials must exercise restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offense and the legitimate objective to be achieved. The U.N. Basic Principles further provide that the intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made """"when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.""""  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the proposal to form a Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) as part of the government's new anti-crime initiative. The RAB will include members of the armed forces, the police, and members of the Bangladesh Rifles and Ansars, both paramilitary groups.  During meetings held in April and May, the Bangladesh cabinet objected to the RAB proposals, fearing that the excessive authority of the new force may lead to widespread abuse of power. The Cabinet Committee on Law and Order, however, recommended the formation of the RAB in view of the law and order crisis in the country.  In October 2002, the Bangladesh government launched Operation Clean Heart, an army-led anti-crime initiative that led to thousands of detentions. The government credited the operation with reducing robberies, muggings, and extortions by criminal gangs. In January 2003, the troops were withdrawn following reports that over forty people had died in police custody. While authorities attributed many of the deaths to heart failure, relatives of the deceased claim they were tortured.  In February, Bangladesh's President Iajuddin Ahmed signed a controversial bill granting troops immunity from civilian court prosecution for custodial deaths and other abuses connected to the operation. Soldiers can still be tried under military law.  Human Rights Watch called on the government of Bangladesh to revoke civilian court immunity for military personnel and investigate and prosecute all allegations of deaths in custody and torture.

Aung San Suu Kyi and at least 17 officials of her political party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were detained after a clash in the town of Ye-u on May 30, after reportedly being attacked by members of the Union Solidarity Development Association (USDA), a government-created organization that has increasingly taken on a paramilitary character. According to military officials, four people were killed and fifty injured in the attack. Aung San Suu Kyi has officially been placed in """"protective custody,"""" but her whereabouts remain unknown, raising concerns about her condition. Aung San Suu Kyi had spent the last month touring northern and central Burma, attracting large crowds of supporters and, according to press reports, growing harassment from armed USDA members. Following the incident, the government shut the country's universities as well as several offices of the NLD.  """"This looks like a deliberate attempt by the government to provoke violence to justify a crackdown,"""" said Brad Adams, director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Unless the government gets the message that this is unacceptable, there's clearly the potential for more bloodshed."""" Human Rights Watch called for the release of those detained and all others imprisoned for the peaceful expression of their views in Burma.

In a 23-page report released today, """"Basra: Crime and Insecurity Under British Occupation,"""" Human Rights Watch charged that U.S. and British authorities failed to plan for or provide adequate forces to carry out their international legal obligation as the occupying power.  U.S. and U.K. forces have defended their poor security performance in Iraq by arguing that they lack personnel to patrol city streets. But the Human Rights Watch report documents other failings that have nothing to do with the number of troops on the ground. """"The coalition forces in Basra simply haven't made security a high enough priority, and that was obvious from the moment they entered the city,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"Eight weeks later, there's simply no excuse for the continuing insecurity on the ground.""""  Security conditions in Basra are better than in Baghdad and some other cities occupied by U.S. forces, but Basra's citizens remain fearful for their lives and property.  Human Rights Watch researchers spent four weeks in Basra and southern Iraq interviewing residents and British soldiers and commanders. While the city's streets showed some signs of improved security over this period, hospitals reported up to five gunshot homicides daily, and another five or seven gunshot injuries. Carjackings and organized looting continued to plague neighborhoods. Women and girls were reluctant to return to jobs and schools while criminals roamed the streets and attacked buildings.  Journalists entering the city in early April in the wake of British forces reported thousands of looters carrying on their activity in plain view of British troops. The failure to respond convinced many residents that security was not a priority for the coalition forces.  The shortcomings of British efforts in Basra go beyond numbers, Human Rights Watch said. The coalition has not communicated with the local population on security issues; not deployed international police or judicial personnel; relied on combat troops for policing and security duties without appropriate training; and not arranged protection for victims and witnesses regarding past and current crimes.  """"Coalition forces had the duty to provide security for civilians as soon as they took control over Basra,"""" Zia-Zarifi said. """"There is something terribly wrong when Iraqis are now calling for their former corrupt and brutal police force to provide some semblance of security.""""  British officers responsible for police forces in Basra told Human Rights Watch they lacked sufficient troops and international support to provide security for Basra's 1.5 million people. As of mid-May, some 480 members of the Royal Military Police were available in the British-occupied provinces of Basra and Misan, and only a hundred of these were carrying out street patrols in Basra.

""""There's no reason why the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should be any different."""" Since the roadmap's release in early May, more than fifty Israelis and Palestinians have been killed, humanitarian access to Gaza has been severely restricted, and Israel's continued construction of a """"separation barrier"""" in the West Bank has further limited Palestinian access to jobs, crops, and essential services.  The roadmap, a """"performance-based and goal-driven"""" plan drafted by the United States, the United Nations, the European Union, and Russia (the """"Quartet""""), envisages a three-phased process and a set of goals that include the establishment of a Palestinian state, an end to Palestinian violence and Israeli occupation, and a final resolution to the conflict.

Instead, all parties let abuses proliferate to the point where they fatally damaged the entire negotiating process.

If no separate human rights mechanism is established, Human Rights Watch said, at the very least all monitoring committees established under the roadmap should include people trained in international humanitarian law and human rights standards.  Human Rights Watch said that basic human rights and humanitarian law obligations mentioned in the roadmap, such as those relating to medical and humanitarian access, could be undermined if they are treated as options subject to negotiation and reciprocity.

Otamaza Gafarov was due to be released in September from Chirchik prison in northern Uzbekistan. Instead, he died there on May 3, apparently from torture. Human Rights Watch received information about his death shortly after the U.S. State Department issued a memorandum certifying that Uzbekistan has made “substantial and continuing progress” in respecting human rights.  “Another prisoner tortured to death in Uzbekistan is not progress—it is more of the same,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “This is the tenth torture-related death in custody we’ve documented in the past year and a half. The State Department’s claims of human rights progress simply do not reflect reality.”  Family members who helped to wash Gafarov’s body told Human Rights Watch that they observed a large wound to his head that appeared to have been caused by a sharp object. There was also bruising to the back of his head. Gafarov’s rib cage, chest and throat were also bruised, and his hands were scratched.  The State Department memorandum, signed in May 2003, specifically cited torture among the areas where the Uzbek government had made progress. The memorandum certifies that Uzbekistan made overall progress in meeting its human rights and democracy commitments under the “Declaration on the Strategic Partnership and Cooperation Framework” that the two countries signed in March 2002. The certification is required semi-annually to release U.S. assistance to the Uzbek government.  The March 2002 declaration committed Uzbekistan to ensuring a “strong and open civil society,” “respect for human rights and freedoms,” a “genuine multi-party system,” “free and fair elections,” “political pluralism, diversity of opinions and the freedom to express them,” “the independence of the media” and “independence of the courts.”  In a critique of the memorandum Human Rights Watch noted that the State Department cited isolated positive steps taken by the Uzbek government without acknowledging ongoing practices that undermine these nominal measures. The critique describes ongoing setbacks, including torture-related deaths in custody; new arrests and convictions based on peaceful religious expression; denial of the right to register for political opposition parties; dismissals, intimidation, and beatings of journalists; and harassment and arbitrary arrest of human rights defenders.  With regard to torture, the State Department cited the Uzbek government’s “adequate cooperation” with the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture Theo van Boven during his December 2002 visit as evidence that the government “has become more willing to discuss torture.” In fact, Mr. van Boven has made clear that he did not receive adequate cooperation. Moreover, the Uzbek government has taken no serious steps to implement his recommendations for ending torture.  Background on the Gafarov Case Before his death, Otamaza Gafarov was nearing the end of a seven-year ordeal. He was sentenced to imprisonment in 1996, on what his family believed to be trumped-up charges of stealing state property. While in prison, he was frequently sent to punishment cells for objecting to prison authorities’ mistreatment of fellow prisoners and demands for bribes from prisoners’ family members.  Gafarov was transferred to a pre-release prison in September 2002, where he was able to live with his family and work, remaining under supervision of prison authorities. Subsequently, Gafarov again clashed with prison authorities over money he earned while working in prison, which the warden allegedly attempted to confiscate.  Following this incident, authorities again sent Gafarov to punishment cells, and subsequently confined him to the prison grounds, prevented him from working, and even pursued a criminal case against him regarding the money he had earned while working. The investigation was closed, and Gafarov returned to Chirchik prison at the beginning of April.  A month later, on May 5, Gafarov’s family received a telegram that Gafarov had died two days before. When they retrieved his bruised body, prison authorities told them that he died of a heart attack, although one guard told the family that Gafaraov’s death “happened differently.”  “This continuing pattern of horrific abuse warrants a forceful response from the international community,” said Andersen. “We are looking to the governments of the United States and the European Union, and international institutions such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to firmly condemn Gafarov’s death and call for an independent investigation into the incident.”  Senior government officials from both the U.S. and the E.U. were gathering in Tashkent for the EBRD annual meeting when Gafarov’s family brought home his battered body.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

The hard-hitting 198-page report released today by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG), an internal agency watchdog, confirms abuses reported by Human Rights Watch, including prolonged detention without charge, denial of access to legal counsel, and excessively harsh conditions of confinement. “The report is a superb exposé of how the Justice Department circumvented people’s basic rights after September 11,” said Wendy Patten, U.S. advocacy director at Human Rights Watch. “Now the ball is in the Attorney General’s court. He cannot ignore the damning findings and the detailed recommendations for ensuring these abuses are not repeated.”   In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the Justice Department detained over 1,200 non-citizens, primarily from Middle Eastern, South Asian, and North African countries. The government used immigration charges as a pretext to detain 766 non-citizens while it investigated possible links to terrorism. At most, no more than a handful of these “special interest” detainees have been charged with a terrorism-related crime. The Justice Department has refused to release the identities of these detainees and has conducted the majority of their immigration hearings in secret.  Last year, Human Rights Watch reported extensively on the failure of the Department of Justice, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to respect the basic human rights of the detainees. (See, “Presumption of Guilt: Human Rights Abuses of Post-September 11 Detainees.”) Today’s OIG report, “The September 11 Detainees: A Review of the Treatment of Aliens Held on Immigration Charges in Connection with the Investigation of the September 11 Attacks,” details many of the same failures and provides new insights into the internal workings of the Justice Department and how it circumvented key constitutional safeguards. OIG findings include: Detention without prompt notice of charges: Failure to promptly serve immigration charges on detainees and on the court resulted in delays in individuals’ understanding why they were being held, in obtaining legal representation, and in requesting bond hearings.  Use of immigration detention to investigate criminal activity: The report sheds light on the Justice Department’s policy to keep these non-citizens in detention until the FBI cleared them of possible links to terrorism. The “clearance” process operated to keep detainees in custody even after their immigration cases had been resolved and they had been ordered deported to their home countries. The report also found that the FBI and INS did not distinguish promptly enough between aliens who were subject of anti-terrorism investigations and those encountered and detained by happenstance.  Blanket denial of bail: The OIG report criticizes the Justice Department's efforts to oppose bail for all September 11 immigration detainees through its use of a “no bond” policy that overrode judicial orders to release detainees on bond while their immigration cases were pending. The report reveals that INS attorneys raised questions about the lawfulness of this policy, but the Justice Department did not address these issues in a timely manner.  Physical and verbal abuse: The report finds a pattern of physical and verbal abuse by some federal correctional staff at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York. The investigation of these particular abuses is ongoing. Restrictive conditions of detention: The OIG documented the extremely restrictive high-security conditions under which the Federal Bureau of Prisons housed September 11 detainees at the MDC, including round-the-clock confinement in small cells that were constantly illuminated.","United States",""

On May 29, Nepali officials sought to turn the group over to Chinese authorities intent on returning them to China, where they would have faced the risk of persecution.  """"It is outrageous that Nepal would even contemplate handing Tibetans over given the well-documented mistreatment of Tibetans returned to China,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Nepal has a clear obligation to protect all Tibetans in Nepal from forced return to China."""" Human Rights Watch supports the efforts of the UNHCR to insist that Nepal honor its obligations under customary international law to protect Tibetans from being returned home where their lives or freedom would be threatened. International refugee standards also protect individuals with a well-founded fear of persecution from being accessed by the government of their home country without their consent.  On April 17, the Nepali Immigration Department sentenced a group of Tibetans to prison terms ranging between three and ten months in lieu of fines totaling U.S.$1,713, which the group members could not pay. Along with three young children, they had entered Nepal in their efforts to reach Nelen Khang, the Tibetan Refugee Center in Kathmandu, and then to proceed to India. The children were placed in UNHCR custody.  On May 29, after the Nepal Department of Immigration asked UNHCR to return the children, staff from Nelen Khang went to the immigration prison in Dilli Bazaar to pay the fines and request release of the group members into UNHCR custody. As had been longstanding practice, UNHCR would have then facilitated their further passage to India.  Instead, Nelen Khang found two Chinese embassy officials present at the immigration prison preparing paperwork to have the Tibetans released into Chinese custody. The Chinese officials had brought a van and were accompanied by six Nepali police officers. Nelen Khang immediately contacted UNHCR. UNHCR complained and the Chinese officials left the immigration facility. On orders from the Director of Immigration, Nepali police handcuffed the refugees and transported them to police headquarters in Kathmandu, where they remain. UNHCR officials have formally requested interviews with the Tibetan detainees.  Under the UNHCR Revised Guidelines on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers, the Nepali government is obligated to inform detainees of their right to counsel or, where possible, to receive free legal assistance. In addition, the refugees are entitled to independent and automatic review of the necessity of their detention, the right to contact and be contacted by UNHCR, and to communicate privately and have the means to do so made available.

The G-8 summit is expected to pledge international support for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraq. """"Afghanistan's recovery has been undermined by the same human rights problems that are now developing in Iraq,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"G-8 members should not repeat those mistakes.""""  Human Rights Watch said the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan had failed to provide adequate security, to allow human rights monitoring, or to ensure that powerful figures responsible for past abuses were removed from positions of influence.  Human Rights Watch called on G-8 members to support long-term police and judicial reforms in Iraq, starting with the screening and vetting of law enforcement personnel to remove abusive officials. G-8 leaders should also support the establishment of an international tribunal to try those responsible for the grave abuses committed in Iraq over many years.  In Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch called on G-8 members to support the expansion of international peacekeeping forces and human rights monitoring to better enforce disarmament plans and improve security for the upcoming constitutional process and elections.  Human Rights Watch also urged G-8 leaders to deploy troops immediately to stop bloodshed in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). At their last summit meeting in Canada, G-8 leaders pledged support for the New Partnership for African Development (Nepad) and peace initiatives in the Great Lakes region.  Human Rights Watch called on the G-8 to work with Nepad to develop a binding code of conduct for companies to prevent the illegal exploitation of resources or funding of warring parties in conflicts like the DRC. A United Nations expert report last year alleged that several companies based in G-8 countries were involved in such activities in the DRC.  Human Rights Watch joined with other non-governmental organizations in calling on the G-8, international financial institutions and credit agencies to require that resource extraction companies publish their payments to, and relevant contractual arrangements with, governments in all countries where they operate. Human Rights Watch welcomed the auditing arrangement the U.N. Security Council has put in place to monitor Iraqi oil revenues, but urged that the audits include expenditure as well as be published on a quarterly basis.  Human Rights Watch called on G-8 leaders to stop the transfer of small arms to human rights abusers, and to promote binding treaties at the international and regional level to regulate arms transfers on human rights grounds.  """"If G-8 leaders are sincere in their commitment to Africa's development, they can stop their companies engaging in the blood trade that is fuelling many African conflicts,"""" Mungoven said.  The Human Rights Watch letter to G-8 leaders also highlighted concerns that the fight against terrorism is being used by many governments - including G-8 members - to justify human rights abuses and support to repressive governments.

On May 29, twenty-two-year-old Eddy Quilca Cruz died after soldiers fired on students marching at Puno’s University of the Altiplano. Dozens of others were reported injured, some with gunshot wounds.   A day earlier, eighteen protesters were wounded in Barranca, a city north of Lima, Peru’s capital. According to a local government official, some protestors suffered gunshot wounds after police and soldiers fired at them. Human Rights Watch has also received reports of protestors hurt in clashes with troops in Huancayo, Trujillo, Chiclayo, and Arequipa.  “To prevent further civilian deaths, President Alejandro Toledo should order an immediate inquiry into the reported use of lethal force by the army and police, particularly the incidents in Puno and Barranca,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Americas Division. “Non-violent methods must be used as much as possible during protests to minimize harm to human life.”  Defense Minister Aurelio Loret de Mola said that the troops involved in the Puno incident opened fire in self-defense, after giving warnings and finding themselves surrounded by a hostile crowd armed with sharp objects, stones, and Molotov cocktails. The press reported that troops were clearing debris left by striking farmers to block the Pan American highway, and that protestors hurled stones and other objects at them and vandalized buildings. Student leaders and local authorities, however, said that soldiers overreacted and were not under threat.  The United Nations Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials provides that law enforcement officials, in carrying out their duty, shall, as far as possible, apply non-violent means before resorting to the use of force and firearms. Whenever the lawful use of force and firearms is unavoidable, law enforcement officials shall use restraint and act in proportion to the seriousness of the offence. The legitimate objective should be achieved with minimal damage and injury, and preservation of human life respected.  On May 27, President Toledo declared a nationwide state of emergency for thirty days in response to a wave of strikes by teachers, health workers, farmers, and court personnel. The strikers were protesting the government’s failure to improve living conditions. The government decree suspended rights of assembly and authorized police and troops to raid properties and make arrests without a legal warrant. Human Rights Watch called on Peruvian authorities to restore due process guarantees that ensure that the authorities do not carry out arbitrary or unreported detentions.","Americas, Peru","Free Speech"

The E.U.-Russia summit starts today in St. Petersburg, against the backdrop of the city’s 300th anniversary festival. Russian President Vladimir Putin will also welcome leaders from more than forty-five countries to his native city, hosting a lavish program of events to mark the anniversary. President Putin will meet with U.S. President George W. Bush on June 1. “EU and U.S. leaders should look beyond the festivities to Russia’s appalling human rights record in Chechnya,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. “The number of murders and forced disappearances committed in Chechnya makes the republic one of the most dangerous places on earth. St. Petersburg’s splendor should not eclipse this.” Human Rights Watch said that, despite Russia’s assurances of normalization in Chechnya, the situation on the ground has not improved. With the Chechen war in its fourth year, civilians continue daily to be victims of killings, forced disappearances and torture.  According to recently released official statistics, 1,132 civilians were killed in Chechnya in 2002, making the murder rate there more than five times higher than in St. Petersburg and one hundred times higher than in EU countries. Since the beginning of the conflict, hundreds have disappeared without a trace after being detained by Russian troops. Official statistics indicate that at least two people “disappear” in Chechnya every day, and showed no decrease in the number of disappearances for the first three months of 2003.  Human Rights Watch research in March documented twenty-six disappearances between late December and late February. This was the highest rate of “disappearances” Human Rights Watch has documented since the beginning of the conflict. Officials have also recently admitted the existence of forty-nine mass graves containing remains of almost 3,000 people on the territory of Chechnya.  According to the Russian procuracy, since the beginning of the operation, only fifty-eight cases against federal servicemen have reached the trial stage, of those only twelve were on murder charges. Not a single case of forced disappearance case has reached the courts.  “To date, Russian authorities have shown no commitment whatsoever to investigating and prosecuting abuses,” said Andersen. “Summit attendees should strongly back the need for justice.”  The Russian leadership has blatantly disregarded any recommendations made by the international community to improve human rights compliance in Chechnya. Russia has refused to issue invitations to key United Nations mechanisms, including the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and the U.N. Working Group on Disappearances, as required by two prior resolutions adopted by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. Russian authorities have further failed to make available detailed information about the accountability process, as required by the Council of Europe.  Human Rights Watch strongly urged EU and U.S. leaders to use the summit to seek commitments from President Putin regarding Russia’s compliance with key U.N. and Council of Europe requirements and regarding protection and security guarantees for Chechen civilians.  “If Russia wants to be a respected international partner, it should demonstrate a commitment to internationally recognized human rights norms,” said Andersen. “If world leaders fail to raise the human rights situation in Chechnya, that certainly sends a message too.”","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

According to a U.S. Central Command press release, U.S. military forces mistakenly released al-Naifus from the Bucca Internment Camp at Umm Qasr on May 18, 2003. In a report released this week, Human Rights Watch identified Al-Naifus, the pro-Saddam Hussein head of the Albu Alwan tribe, as one of the key officials responsible for the executions of thousands of Shi'a civilians around al-Hilla in 1991. Eyewitnesses from the execution sites, as well as from the military base where Shi'a execution victims were detained prior to their death, told Human Rights Watch that al-Naifus and members of his tribe were directly involved in the executions.  """"The United States still has no justice strategy in place in Iraq to deal with the crimes of the past,"""" said Peter Bouckaert, senior emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"If the United States can mistakenly release a man suspected of killing thousands of people, there is something seriously wrong with the system.""""  Following the executions, the land on which the largest mass grave was located was taken from local farmers and given to a member of al-Naifus' tribe, who was responsible for safeguarding the mass grave.  Al-Naifus was arrested by U.S. Marines near the city of al-Hilla on April 26, 2003, after local officials and victims' families accused him of being directly involved in the killings of thousands of Shi'a civilians. Al-Naifus was transferred to the custody of Army Military Police on April 29, 2003. He underwent a screening conducted by an officer of the Judge Advocate General's (JAG) corps on May 18, 2003, and was then released, apparently because the JAG officer was unaware of the accusations against him.  Many Iraqis have expressed dismay that U.S. and British forces have not yet taken action to secure mass gravesites. As a result, many graves are being exhumed without expertise necessary to ensure accurate identification of bodies and without forensic examination of the bodies that could indicate how and when people were killed.  Human Rights Watch demanded an independent investigation of the circumstances of al-Naifus' release, particularly in light of the fact that the U.S. military was aware of the serious allegations made against al-Naifus.  Human Rights Watch also urged the U.S. occupation forces to quickly adopt a comprehensive justice strategy for past crimes committed in Iraq in order to avoid similar mistakes.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/05/29/putins-party-0","Putins Party","Putin's Party","","05/29/2003","MOSCOW -- This weekend President Vladimir Putin is throwing a big birthday bash for his hometown, St. Petersburg. Heads of state and government from 45 nations, including President George W. Bush and the leaders of all current and acceding European Union countries, will take part in an extravaganza of official ceremonies, tours, concerts and dinners. What other president has received such a grand endorsement from just about every major world leader and right at the start of a campaign for re-election? No doubt the visiting leaders are aware that they are doing Putin an exceptional favor. But will they seek concessions in exchange, especially for Chechnya? While wining and dining in St. Petersburg's splendor, they should remember the black pages of their host's first term as president. In 1999, as prime minister, Putin sent Russian troops to Chechnya, ostensibly to bring peace and stability to that troubled region. But the troops' brutal force quickly alienated a population already gasping for peace. Four years on, Russian troops and Chechen rebels are still engaged in a bitter guerilla war, with civilians the primary victims. Recently released statistics on murders and so-called disappearances show that Chechnya is among the most dangerous places on earth. At 110 to 140 murders per 100,000 inhabitants, Chechnya's murder rate last year outstripped that of Colombia, where 77 murders per 100,000 inhabitants were recorded. Chechnya's murder rate is more than five times higher than St. Petersburg's, more than 20 times higher than in the United States, and from 50 to 100 times higher than in EU countries. Chechnya is also a world leader in disappearances. Over the last three years, hundreds of people taken into custody by Russian troops have disappeared, though in some cases their mutilated dead bodies have been found. Recently, officials in Chechnya have come forward with shocking new statistics on disappearances: since the beginning of 2003 at least 60 people have disappeared every month. Yet Putin rejects all criticism of his troops' behavior in Chechnya, asserting that Russia's military operation is its contribution to the U.S.-led war on terrorism. Just last week, Putin inferred a link between two suicide attacks in Chechnya and the terrorist attack in Riyadh, saying the handwriting of the terrorist acts in Chechnya and Saudi Arabia is absolutely the same. There may indeed be a link between Chechnya's rebels and Al Qaeda. The question is whether that link exists despite, or because of, Russia's operation in Chechnya. In Chechnya's traditionally secular society, the spread of Islamic fundamentalism which is still rejected by the majority of Chechens has coincided with Russia's military operations. It is thus unclear whether Russia's operations in Chechnya contribute to the war on terrorism or undermine it. Nobody wants to spoil a party. But the leaders visiting St. Petersburg should confront the reality that Chechens live in misery, wondering from one day to the next whether masked men will come in the middle of the night and take their loved ones away. The assembled heads of state should demand that Russian forces conduct operations in a way that will protect, not alienate, Chechens.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Human Rights Watch called on the Uzbek government to immediately release the three rights activists pending further investigation. On May 26, police arrested Ruslan Sharipov, an independent human rights activist and journalist known for his critical articles on police corruption and human rights abuses. Police also arrested Sharipov’s colleagues Oleg Sarapulov and Azamat Mamankulov. On Wednesday, police from the Anti-Terrorism Department told Human Rights Watch that Sharipov is being charged with having committed homosexual acts (article 120 of the criminal code). The police said they are also looking into allegations Sharipov had sex with two male minors for money. No charges have been filed against Sarapulov or Mamankulov.  “Sharipov’s longstanding history of criticizing government policy, combined with past harassment against him and his colleagues, raise strong suspicions that this is a politically motivated case,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “That the authorities would charge him with committing homosexual acts, violating his fundamental rights to non-discrimination and privacy, makes it doubly egregious.”  For more than twenty-four hours following Sharipov’s arrest, police from the Mirzo-Ulugbekski Police Department denied to Human Rights Watch and others from the international community that Sharipov and his colleagues were in their custody. Only in the late morning on May 27 did the police admit that the three were in custody. That evening, police denied access to a lawyer who requested to see Sharipov. The next day, police allowed Sharipov a meeting with a lawyer and Human Rights Watch, but only in the presence of police officers. Sharipov told Human Rights Watch that police hit him several times, threatened to rape him with a bottle, and put a gas mask on him. He said they also displayed copies of his articles on a table in front of him and shouted at him for long periods.  Sharipov said that he has never hidden his sexual orientation. He told Human Rights Watch that he believes the case is being fabricated against him in retribution for articles he wrote exposing police corruption.  “Police have already violated Sharipov’s rights,” said Andersen. “We will be following this case very closely.”  Human Rights Watch has documented prior harassment of Ruslan Sharipov, Oleg Sarapulov and Azamat Mamankulov. On October 21, 2002, National Security Service officers forcefully escorted Mamankulov out of an Internet café, hit him several times in the stomach and head, and warned him to stop working with Sharipov. On February 22, police detained Sarapulov and questioned him about Internet articles in his possession that were critical of the Uzbek government. He was released after two days. He told Human Rights Watch that the police planted on him leaflets belonging to Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic group banned in Uzbekistan.  In March 2002, Human Rights Watch wrote to President Karimov, expressing alarm at three attacks on Sharipov in January and February 2002, including being dragged into a car by police officers and questioned about his journalistic activities, and being beaten twice by unidentified attackers who took his mobile telephone, journalist accreditation card, passport and money.  Since 1994, the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which monitors compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), has called on countries that are party to the convention to repeal sodomy laws, or laws that punish adult, consensual homosexual acts. The Committee held that such laws violate protections against discrimination in the ICCPR, as well as article 17, which protects the right to privacy.

Four police officers present during the attack refused to intervene despite appeals by Kontras staff.

It has a long history of monitoring and reporting on human rights violations in Aceh, in part from a field office there. Last week, the Indonesian military commander in Aceh listed Kontras as one of the NGOs that would be monitored for alleged separatist activities.  President Megawati Sukarnoputri declared a state of military emergency for Aceh on May 19, 2003. Since then fighting in the province has escalated.

The kingdom's new criminal procedure code became law in May 2002.  The Saudi government does not allow international human rights groups to conduct investigations in Saudi Arabia, so independent assessments of the code's implementation are not possible. In a memorandum to Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, Human Rights Watch identified eight areas in which the rights of criminal suspects have been systematically violated. These include the use of torture and threats to obtain confessions, a lack of judicial response to individual allegations of mistreatment, and holding trials without the notification or participation of defense lawyers. The new criminal procedure code includes a prohibition against torture and degrading treatment, as well as recognition of the right to a lawyer during criminal investigations and trials.  The memorandum was sent to Crown Prince Abdullah on May 6 and made public today.  """"The new criminal procedure code contains some important improvements, but it's not clear whether they're being implemented,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Saudi government should answer to some fundamental questions about how the justice system works now.""""  In January 2003, the Saudi government for the first time allowed an official Human Rights Watch delegation to visit the kingdom. The reform of the criminal justice system was one of the main areas of discussion with Saudi ministers and other senior officials.  In its memorandum to Crown Prince Abdullah, Human Rights Watch criticized the practice of holding suspects in prolonged incommunicado detention, when interior ministry operatives typically conduct abusive interrogations, and called for the prompt access of lawyers and family members to detainees. Human Rights Watch also highlighted the interior ministry's practice of forcing detainees to sign pre-release statements that they were not mistreated and that they will remain silent about the details of the interrogation process. This practice should be immediately investigated and discontinued, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch also recommended that all judges in the kingdom be instructed to order investigations if suspects credibly allege during trials that torture or other abuse was used to coerce confessions, as required by the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Saudi Arabia became a party to this treaty in 1997, and its provisions can be invoked before Saudi courts.  Closed trials should be the exception and not the rule in Saudi Arabia, and interested parties-including families, defense lawyers and other legal representatives, and consular officials-should always be informed of the place and date of trials, Human Rights Watch said. In no case should legal representatives be prevented from attending a trial and representing their clients.  The Human Rights Watch memorandum cites the Canadian government's complaint in April 2002 about the trial and appeal proceedings of its citizen William Sampson, one of the seven foreigners accused of carrying out bombings against Westerners in 2000 and 2001. is trial """"was held in secret and even [Sampson's] lawyer was not informed,"""" the foreign affairs department said it had learned. """"Mr. Sampson was not legally represented at the two subsequent appeals either. The Saudi authorities have assured us Mr. Sampson would have legal representation, and there were no suggestions that the trials would be held in secret."""" It took Canadian authorities three more months to obtain official notification from the Saudi government that Sampson had in fact been secretly tried and sentenced to death.  """"Transparency in the criminal justice system is an important benchmark of reform, and authorities should make clear how the public can obtain information about criminal trial proceedings and court judgments,"""" Megally said.  Article 182 of the new criminal procedure code states that if a trial has been conducted in closed session, the court's judgment should be read in an open session. It indicates that the public has a right to the most pertinent information about all trials, including """"the name of the rendering court, its date, names of the judges, names of the litigants, the crime subject of the action, a summary of claims or defenses submitted by the litigants and the supporting evidence and arguments, the stages of the action, the text of the judgment, reasons and legal bases thereof, and whether it was rendered unanimously or by majority vote.""""  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the availability of legal assistance for the thousands of people currently awaiting trial in Saudi Arabia. In January 2003, the director of the interior ministry's prisons administration, Major General Dr. Ali bin Hussein al-Harithi, told Human Rights Watch that there were some 13,000 men and women in Saudi prisons who had not yet been convicted. About 6,000 of them were migrant workers and other foreigners.  The criminal procedure code establishes the right of every accused person to seek legal assistance during investigation and trial, although it does not explicitly guarantee the right to a lawyer for those who cannot afford one. The government should explain the steps that have been taken to guarantee this right, Human Rights Watch said.

On May 21, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs Silvan Shalom said that """"most human rights offices in the West Bank and Gaza strip provide shelter for Palestinian terrorists.""""  This comment has no basis in fact and constitutes a further threat to the work of independent human rights organizations and workers in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. “We fear that such unsupported allegations are intended to intimidate local and international human rights defenders, and to prevent them from carrying out their daily work,” the organizations said.  Palestinian and Israeli human rights organizations have long suffered crippling restrictions on freedom of movement. Researchers carry out their work under circumstances of considerable personal danger, and many have suffered intimidation and harassment by the Israeli authorities and army while carrying out their work.  “In light of the Minister's comments we fear such intimidation and harassment will further increase. Recently, threats to personal safety and restrictions on the activities of local and international human rights and humanitarian workers and peace activists have sharply increased”, said the organizations.  This year alone, the Israeli army has killed a foreign peace activist, Rachel Corrie and gravely injured two others, Tom Hurndall and Brian Avery. A foreign journalist, James Miller, was also shot dead by Israeli soldiers and in previous months Israeli soldiers. A military investigation undertaken into Rachel Corrie’s killing reportedly found no wrongdoing, although the full findings have not been made public. It is not known whether the other events have been investigated: certainly, no findings on any of these killings or injuries have been released, and no judicial action taken.  At the same time, international human rights workers and peace activists are increasingly being arrested and threatened with deportation by the Israeli authorities. At least two have been deported in recent weeks, and several others are facing deportation orders. At least six foreign humanitarian workers have been refused entry to Israel, and growing restrictions are imposed on movement and activities of those already present in the country.  Of particular concern is the decision of the Israeli authorities on 9 May to condition entry of foreigners into the Gaza Strip to their signing a """"waiver"""" which seeks to absolve Israel from responsibility for any death or injury caused by Israeli soldiers.  Among other things, the """"waiver"""" states that those entering the Gaza Strip: """"accept that the government of the state of Israel and its organs cannot be held responsible for death, injury and/or damage/loss of property which may be incurred as a result of military activity"""".  The Gaza Strip was subsequently closed and remains inaccessible to foreigners, except diplomats and selected emergency relief workers.  These restrictions on the movement and activities of local and international human rights and humanitarian workers, peace activists, journalists and others are intended to reduce independent scrutiny of the human rights situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.  “Such restrictions on independent monitoring serious human rights violations can only aggravate the current atmosphere of impunity.”  The organizations called on Foreign Minister Silvan Shalom and the Israeli authorities to: Retract publicly the unfounded allegations made by Minister Shalom on 21 May 2003; Put an end to harassment, intimidation, threats, and deliberate attacks on human rights defenders; Cease arbitrarily arresting human rights defenders and foreign nationals. Those arrested should be charged with a recognized criminal offense, based on factual and public evidence; Abide by the provisions of the Declaration on the Protection of Human Rights Defenders adopted on December 9, 1998 by the UN General Assembly and in particular its Article 1, which states that: """"Everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, to promote and to strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at the national and international level;"""" Immediately lift the restrictions on access imposed on the Gaza Strip and facilitate development work, humanitarian aid and human rights monitoring by providing full and unrestricted access to all; and, Conform with international human rights and humanitarian law in all actions and ensure that all killings and other violations are thoroughly and independently investigated.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

Having refused to endorse the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, France, Germany and their allies now face retribution from the Bush administration. Several European capitals seem gripped by panic in their desire to make amends. This longing to kiss and make up at any price has jeopardized the emerging international system of justice for the worst human rights offenders.   The Bush administration loathes international justice, particularly the newly established International Criminal Court, for fear that it might restrain the unbridled latitude of the United States. Three aspects are at risk of being compromised.   First, the United Nations Security Council resolution on postwar administration of Iraq, which was approved Thursday, speaks in general terms about the importance of bringing Saddam Hussein's henchmen to justice but is conspicuously silent on the means. That suits Washington fine, since it wants a justice process it can control, composed of hand-picked Iraqis, rather than an independent, internationally led tribunal.   What's wrong with an """"Iraqi-led"""" tribunal, as the United States calls it? We know that bringing to justice the architects of the slaughter of some quarter of a million people - the rough toll of Saddam Hussein's government - can be extraordinarily complex. Judges and prosecutors who populated his brutal and arbitrary justice system can hardly be expected to have the necessary expertise, let alone a tradition of fairness and independence.   Even exiled Iraqi jurists, as well as Iraqis from communities historically repressed by the Ba'ath Party who remained in the country, will have a hard time demonstrating the right combination of skills and emotional distance from the former dictatorship. The problem is only compounded because the people Washington designates are likely to be perceived as puppets rather than independent dispensers of justice.   By contrast, an internationally led tribunal, whether fully international like the ones established for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia or mixed national-international, like Sierra Leone's, is more likely to be seen as legitimate and better able to draw from a wide pool of experienced jurists. The UN Security Council thus should, at minimum, establish an international commission of inquiry to decide on the best type of tribunal for Iraq and to preserve evidence such as the mass graves that U.S. troops are now allowing to be despoiled.   U.S. opposition to an internationally led tribunal has nothing to do with the welfare of the Iraqi people. Its distrust of an independent international tribunal reflects its desire to avoid scrutiny of its own military effort and potentially embarrassing revelations about its current and past alliances. It also dislikes international tribunals' rejection of the death penalty. And it opposes any step that might bolster the system of international justice and thus, even indirectly, legitimize the International Criminal Court, or ICC. None of these reasons merits European endorsement.   Second, the Bush administration is pressing governments worldwide to sign bilateral agreements that would immunize Americans from ICC scrutiny. So far, despite threatening to cut off military aid, Washington has arm-twisted only a collection of small and vulnerable states to accept this impunity regime. No European Union government has yet acquiesced, but Britain, Spain and Italy have blocked a common EU rejection.   The ICC treaty does permit transferring suspects to their home countries for investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution, but only on the condition that the ICC retain the power to scrutinize national justice efforts to ensure they are carried out in good faith. So long as Washington resists that oversight, even for crimes committed in countries that have ratified the ICC treaty, European governments should collectively refuse to shield Americans from transfer to The Hague.   Finally, Washington is about to renew its request to exempt all military operations authorized by the UN Security Council from ICC jurisdiction. A year ago, by threatening to veto further peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and risk renewed ethnic cleansing, the Bush administration gained a one-year blanket exemption for such operations. That violated the ICC requirement that any Security Council exemption be granted case by case.   The exemption speaks only in terms of troops from countries that haven't ratified the ICC treaty, but it includes operations in countries that have. It comes up for renewal by July 1, but this time Washington's hand is weaker, since one of the first peacekeeping operations up for extension will be in southern Lebanon.   Because America cannot credibly threaten to leave Israel's northern border unguarded from Hezbollah, European governments on the Security Council should stand firm and reject any blanket exemption.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

Australian authorities are maintaining that the country is safe for many Afghans to return to. The government’s Immigration Department recently supplied Afghans with a four-page “country information report” about Afghanistan, containing minimal substantive information about country conditions, and giving misleading information about human rights protections.  But Human Rights Watch has documented incidents of violence, rape and home invasions in many regions of Afghanistan, inside and outside Kabul.  Afghan refugees in Australia are currently having their temporary visas reviewed by the Australian government. However, many Afghans who fled years ago may not even know how insecure conditions are in their regions of origin.  “Reports from the field show that Afghanistan is far from stable,” said Alison Parker, a refugee protection expert at Human Rights Watch. “Security forces are still committing serious human rights abuses against local populations. This is not a safe environment for refugees to return to.”  International law requires that Afghans who harbor a well-founded fear of persecution be protected from return to places where their lives or freedom are threatened. Officials claim that returnees can, at least, live in Kabul, but this is an unrealistic expectation for many Afghans, who originally come from rural areas and need extended family networks to survive. Australian authorities are not taking into account the specific conditions that Afghans slated for return will face in rural areas.  The information provided to Afghans by Australia’s Immigration Department contains two paragraphs on human rights, describing the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission and the United Nations’ efforts to hold seminars and workshops. Notably absent are any descriptions of ongoing human rights abuses in the country.  “Australia has provided Afghans with four pages of incomplete and misleading information about conditions in Afghanistan,” said Parker. “On the basis of that document, Afghans cannot make accurate judgments about the insecurity they may face if sent home.”  For example, Australian authorities plan to deport some Afghans to Logar province, where Human Rights Watch documented severe security problems due to abuses by local militia gunmen, including robberies and murder. Human Rights Watch also found cases of political intimidation, and documented several attacks on girls’ schools.  Others slated for return from Australia come from Zabul, an extremely unstable province. U.S.-led military operations are underway in several areas, and local military leaders are involved in ongoing criminal activities and revivals of Taliban-era social restrictions. United Nations operations were suspended in Zabul in late April, after gunmen shot two de-miners there.  Human Rights Watch also documented cases of returning refugees being targeted for extortion by local forces, especially outside of Kabul, due to a perception that they are carrying home money they obtained abroad.  Many other provinces in Afghanistan suffer from similar problems.  Australia also proposes to return women and children, especially several Afghans who entered Australia as minors without other family members and who will return to Afghanistan alone.  “The haste to send people back to Afghanistan is rash and irresponsible. Vulnerable women and children risk being sent to unstable and dangerous regions. In some places, women are still facing Taliban-era restrictions,” Parker said.  Human Rights Watch called on the Australian government to refrain from returning individuals without proper screening that takes into account current human rights conditions in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch also urged the government to ensure that all recognized refugees enjoy a secure legal status and humanitarian assistance in accordance with international law.","Asia, Afghanistan, Australia",""

Armenia’s parliamentary elections are slated to take place May 25.   (Briefing Paper) In a 24-page briefing paper released today, Human Rights Watch documents the arbitrary arrest of hundreds of opposition activists during the presidential elections, the abuse of the Soviet-era Code of Administrative Offenses to justify the arrests, and the disabling impact the arrests had on the opposition’s campaign. Human Rights Watch also called for urgent reform of Armenia’s flawed administrative justice system.  “The Armenian authorities use the outdated code on punishing public order misdemeanors as a tool of political repression,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “This weekend’s elections will be a test of their will to stop this practice.”  More than a hundred opposition activists were given prison sentences of up to fifteen days in February and March under the code, for attending, or allegedly misbehaving at, rallies that the authorities arbitrarily deemed “unauthorized.” Police denied them access to counsel, and judges tried them in closed, cursory hearings at which defendants were denied attorneys, the opportunity to present evidence, and their right to appeal.  In March, the Council of Europe reiterated its call for reform of the code, and condemned the administrative detentions as “a misuse of law.” On April 16, the Armenian Constitutional Court declared the arrests unlawful, and recognized the impact they had on the election.  The Council of Justice, a judicial oversight body headed by President Robert Kocharian, rejected the court’s instruction to review the conduct of judges who had issued the administrative detention sentences. In an April 23 resolution condemned by a prominent Armenian rights group as “ordered up” by the authorities, another oversight body, the Council of Court Chairmen, concluded that the administrative detention sentences had been, “on the whole, legal and well-grounded.”  “The authorities appear determined to retain an administrative detention option for the forthcoming elections, and that’s deeply troubling,” said Andersen.  Background on the Elections: Armenian citizens are going to the polls to elect parliamentary deputies to the 131-member National Assembly, and to vote on a referendum on proposed constitutional amendments. Seventy-five parliamentary mandates are to be apportioned among those parties and electoral blocs that garner more than 5 percent support in a party list contest. Fifty-six mandates will be determined in single-member constituencies, in a one-round majoritarian system.  The contest closely follows the presidential elections, won by the incumbent, President Robert Kocharian in a March 5 runoff against Stepan Demirchian. In that election, widespread ballot stuffing, intimidation and irregularities in tabulation marred the poll.  The opposition disputed the result and staged a series of protest rallies for several weeks afterward. Demirchian filed a complaint on the election results to the Constitutional Court, which on April 16 issued a ruling leaving the election results unchanged, but upholding many constituent parts of the complaint. Recognizing the controversy stirred by the presidential elections, the court also recommended that the government hold a national “referendum of confidence” within one year. President Kocharian has announced his refusal to do so.  Following the presidential elections, several parties supporting Demirchian formed an opposition bloc, called Arturutiun (Justice), to contest the party list vote in the parliamentary election. Demirchian has declared an intention of winning sufficient mandates to launch impeachment proceedings against President Kocharian in the new parliament. The National Unity Party of Artashes Geghamian, who placed third in the first round of the presidential election, is running on its own for the national party list contest. Increasingly, these two opposition forces have traded verbal attacks, as they vie for the anti-government vote.  The parliamentary election campaign has also brought out tensions between the Republican Party and Dashnaktsutiun (the Dashnak Party). Although they jointly constitute the government, and both supported President Kocharian’s re-election, they appear to be campaigning against each other – each striving to augment their influence in government at the expense of the other.  The political parties are thinly represented in the contest for single-member majoritarian constituencies, where powerful local businessmen tend to dominate.","Europe/Central Asia, Armenia","Free Speech"

""""Mr. Vieira de Mello is a great choice for this post,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Protecting human rights is essential for successfully rebuilding Iraq. Mr. Vieira de Mello will bring his experience of the top human rights post to this important role.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed concern at the impact that Mr. Vieira de Mello's temporary reassignment could have on the U.N. High Commissioner's office. """"A temporary replacement will never have the clout that is needed to fill this critical role. It is essential that a vacuum not be left in this important post,"""" Roth said.  The responsibilities of the Special Representative, outlined in the Security Council resolution 1483 of May 22, 2003, will include human rights and humanitarian issues.  Human Rights Watch called on the newly appointed Special Representative to: Take immediate steps to establish human rights monitoring throughout Iraq. Human rights monitors should be able to report regularly on the human rights situation within the country and make recommendations for remedial action, including long-term institutional reform. The monitors' work would also help to bolster the confidence of the Iraqi public that progress is being made towards human rights improvements. Press for the establishment of an international commission of experts mandated to make recommendations regarding the type of international justice mechanism best suited to satisfy """"the need for accountability for crimes and atrocities committed by the previous Iraqi regime,"""" as affirmed by the Security Council resolution 1483. Take immediate steps aimed at the collection and preservation of forensic evidence in Iraq and the creation of an agency to register cases of the disappeared and facilitate the certification of death and the recovery of remains. Monitor, in collaboration with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other relevant agencies, the situation of refugees and the internally displaced inside Iraq, and provide remedies for abuses they suffer, including when refugees and displaced populations return to their home areas and property. Make it a top priority to address the threat posed to civilian lives in Iraq by antipersonnel landmines and unexploded ordnance, and encourage coalition forces to provide and disseminate detailed information on the types, numbers, and locations of munitions used in order to facilitate effective warnings to civilians and rapid clearance.

Member States asking them to make contributions to the Sierra Leone Special Court. We are aware that you worked tirelessly to convince states to make initial voluntary contributions to the Court so that it could commence operations. We too are very concerned about the lack of financial support the Court is receiving from states, and urge you to take every appropriate opportunity to raise this issue bilaterally with states.   The outstanding facts as we know them are that the Court is far short of its estimated budget for its second and third years of operation. For the Court's second year of operation, it has received pledges of only $13.5 million, of which only $6.3 million have been redeemed. This is out of an estimated budget of $24.8 million. For the Court's third year of operation, the figures are even more dire - the Court has only $7.4 million in pledges. Thus, as things currently stand, the Court will run out of money by the end of 2003.   As you know, the Court's budget is already """"bare-bones,"""" having been reduced from the originally proposed $118 million. Therefore, it is very crucial to the Court that it receive the full amounts budgeted.   Since its inception, we believe the Special Court has made significant progress. As you know, the first eight indictments for war crimes and crimes against humanity charges have come out, and six of the eight individuals are in custody. The Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) is nearly fully staffed and operational. The Registrar has made major advances in establishing the necessary infrastructure for the Court, setting up offices and clearing the future site for the Court building. Judges have been sworn in, finalized the Court's rules of procedure, and presided at initial hearings. In addition, the Special Court has launched an outreach and legacy project, which is designed to promote the rule of law and accountability long after the trials have ended. We believe that it is critically important to maintain this positive momentum, which can only be done if member states assist by contributing financially.   The Court is not only important in bringing justice to the victims in Sierra Leone, but to send the critically important message to those individual state and non-state actors in West Africa who are responsible for serious abuses, including war crimes, that these types of crimes are unacceptable and that there will be accountability for them.

Should Deploy a Rapid Reaction Force in Ituri","","05/20/2003","Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International today jointly called on the U.N. Security Council to authorize the deployment of a rapid reaction force to protect civilians in Ituri, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). In an open letter to the Security Council, the two human rights organizations called the situation in Ituri “a critical test” of the Security Council’s commitments to prevent mass killings and protect civilians, and noted that the United Nations Observation Mission in Congo (MONUC) has been unable to adequately protect civilians. The Security Council is currently discussing the characteristics and mandate of a possible force. “In Ituri today, the elements of a devastating crisis are clearly present,” said Irene Khan, secretary general of Amnesty International. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International said that thousands of civilians continue to be at risk as opposing Hema and Lendu ethnic militia groups remain fully armed and ready to attack again. Tens of thousands of other civilians are believed to have fled Bunia, and their condition is unknown. The two organizations stressed that any military action should be undertaken with full respect for international human rights and humanitarian law. They emphasized that the rapid reaction force should have a robust mandate to ensure the maintenance of law and order and to protect civilians in Bunia, to locate and protect those civilians who have fled outside the town, and to ensure that humanitarian assistance can reach civilian populations in need. Given the urgency of the situation, the two human rights organizations urged that a rapid reaction force be deployed immediately in the Ituri region, pending an agreement by the Security Council on the expansion and strengthening of MONUC’s mandate, and the respective deployment of its reinforced troops. The organizations are following up their appeal to the Security Council with appeals to specific countries to support Security Council action along the lines suggested and to contribute troops to an U.N.-authorized force. “Thousands of civilians have already died in this conflict,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Only rapid U.N. action can head off continued killings.” At least 5,000 people died from direct violence in Ituri between July 2002 and March 2003. These victims are in addition to the 50,000 civilians that, according to United Nations estimates, have died there since 1999. These losses are just one part of an estimated total of 4.7 million civilians dead throughout the Congo, a toll that makes this war more deadly to civilians than any other since World War II.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

Looters who want to steal equipment or medicine come regularly to his hospital. Gunmen, demanding treatment for relatives, have threatened his staff. The other day, the hospital's only bus was hijacked We need security, Issa says. We can't work like this. The doctor spent the first week after Basra fell to coalition forces staying up at night with his colleagues, guarding his patients and the hospital with wooden clubs. This is not our job, Issa says. His predicament illustrates a major shortcoming in the strategy of the United States and its coalition partners in Iraq, one that was also seen in Afghanistan a year ago: The failure of coalition forces to provide adequate security in a post-conflict power vacuum. For those of us who worked in post-Taliban Afghanistan, these stories bring a sense of deja vu. We have seen what happens when post- conflict security problems are ignored, and it isn't pretty. In Basra, and in many other cities in Iraq, traffic is flowing more freely, and shops stay open later, but local populations continue to be terrorized by crime and general lawlessness. Now a new problem is starting to emerge. In An Nasiriyah and other areas, police forces are being re-established at the direction of U.S. and British forces. Many of the police may have participated in the repression under Saddam Hussein's rule. Few have been properly vetted, and some Iraqis although welcoming efforts to stop lawlessness are anxious about the police being rearmed. In some cities, newly organized militias have started to take security into their own hands. Many of these groups seem to have their own agendas. Some are aiming to seize control of security operations and exert political power. When the Taliban were forced from power in Afghanistan in late 2001, the United States and its coalition partners opted for a strategy of nation-building lite, entrusting security to militia leaders and warlords with terrible human rights records. America transported some warlords back to their former fiefdoms and rearmed and financed them or simply stood by while warlords seized control of army, police and intelligence facilities. Almost everywhere in Afghanistan, local populations complained about the strategy, and asked for international peacekeepers to be deployed outside of Kabul. The United States refused. Human Rights Watch recently completed a research mission in southeastern Afghanistan. Amazingly, we found that many ordinary Afghans are less secure than they were a year ago. In addition to resurgent Taliban activity, we found major problems with Afghanistan's police, army and intelligence forces the same people the United States put in place after defeating the Taliban. In many areas, police officers are turning into criminals at night raiding homes, stealing valuables and even raping young women and girls. Local warlords are fighting each other in several provinces. In the south of the country, aid programs and demining projects have been stopped because of attacks by Taliban remnants, some of whom secretly enjoy the support of local warlords. Even in Kabul, warlords are a problem. Some leaders are using heavy-handed tactics to stifle dissent and free expression, threatening journalists while arresting and torturing political dissidents and civic organizers. One journalist, after he had written an article critical of the powerful Afghan defense minister, Mohammed Fahim, described a visit by his fighters. Look, one of the gunmen told the journalist. We have 30 bullets in our clips. I can shoot all of these 30 bullets into your chest right now, and there is no one who can stop us. Fahim is one of America's closest allies in Afghanistan. The coalition policy of playing down security problems and relying on local enforcers has failed in Afghanistan, and it will fail again in Iraq. America and its coalition partners urgently need to increase peacekeeping forces in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Denying security and human rights protections to people of both countries only compounds their misery and creates mistrust of America.

Human rights are the missing guest at the diplomatic table.","05/18/2003","Ariel Sharon is due to meet George Bush at the White House this week where the two men will discuss the latest Middle East roadmap - intended to pave the way for lasting peace. The roadmap is deeply flawed in one key respect. It fails to provide the essential human rights protection for a pattern of abuses by Israelis and Palestinians alike. And yet, peace is impossible, unless the importance of protecting civilians is clearly acknowledged by both sides. Human rights are the missing guest at the diplomatic table - when Colin Powell met Sharon in Jerusalem last week, the talk was about security, security, security. Nowhere does the roadmap text mention obligations like the need to investigate and bring to justice those who deliberately attack civilians or commit other international crimes. There is no provision for human rights experts in the body meant to judge progress and monitor success. Commitments to uphold key obligations in international law avoid the language of human rights altogether. Instead, presented as one benchmark among many, they are treated as if they were a form of concession - perhaps contingent on steps taken by the other side - rather than as a basic starting point. Israeli abuses, including the killing of civilians, are described by the roadmap as """"actions undermining trust"""" - an oddly understated phrase, that hardly suggests that Israel will be under strong pressure to end such practices. Meanwhile, there is talk of reforming the Palestinian Authority - but no attention to the legal structure that must support and guarantee it. This, despite the fact that the Palestinian Authority at first employed state security and military courts unfairly to hand out death sentences while simultaneously failing to deploy the criminal justice system against organisers of suicide bombings. In the first twenty-four hours after the roadmap was released, at least nine civilians were killed, and more than 150 injured, in a surge of violence on both sides. They will not be the last to die. And yet, the roadmap does not need to be this way. The sponsors of the roadmap - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations, known as the Quartet - have helped negotiate an end to other, equally violent conflicts. There has been time to learn the lessons in recent years. The Oslo accords emphasised security and policing, at the expense of human rights - which received just three brief mentions in the 165-page interim agreement of 1995. All sides are now paying the price of this neglect. Israelis and Palestinians alike will be eager to downplay their legal and human rights obligations - in the name of increased security. The Quartet members should enforce these obligations so that both sides come to understand that these internationally binding standards are not just intended to protect them when they are hurt, but are to protect civilians on the other side too. Then, and only then, can confidence-building measures really take hold. Quartet members must use international humanitarian law (IHL) and human rights standards in defining benchmarks and judging progress - which would give the bitterly-contested process a better chance of success. They must make clear that presently inbuilt benchmarks that involve fundamental obligations under IHL, otherwise known as the laws of war - respecting the life of the civilian population, access to drinking water or emergency medical services, for example - must be observed and cannot be used as bargaining chips. Finally, a human rights """"champion"""" should be created - an independent human rights body that would form part of the monitoring mechanism. The current proposal is for four committees: security, humanitarian, reform of the Palestinian Authority, and a committee dealing with other issues, including settlements. There should be a fifth committee, which would report and act on human rights violations as they occur during the three-phase process - a vital function, given the potential for such violations to undermine public confidence in the value of negotiation. The committee would provide a vital counterbalance against the roadmap's inbuilt incentives to commit human rights abuses in the name of security. The idea of such mechanisms is not new; they have played a key role in strengthening peace processes in Guatemala, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and elsewhere. If the Quartet members are ready to take these basic steps - and there are no technical or practical reasons not to do so - the roadmap could yet succeed. In the absence of such steps, we can expect a repetition of the failures of the past, and the brutal nihilism that those failures create. Again and again - in a destroyed living room in Jenin, in the desolate rubble of Rafah, in the tiny villages of the West Bank - I have encountered the same mixture of despondency and defiance. As one woman in Jenin told me, explaining her support for suicide bombers: """"We have nothing more to lose. We can't do anything. Look around you: we are dead already."""" Like other inhabitants of Jerusalem, I now recognise the crump and roar which denotes another blown-up bus or cafe. The comment made to me by one Israeli in the wake of the latest violence was as depressing as it was typical: """"Every time an Arab dies, I feel happy - because it's the only thing we can do."""" That mirror of hopelessness means deadlock, which the Quartet could help to break, if only it shows the political will to do so. Security can be gained, by emphasising the right to life; it can never be gained, by claiming the right to kill.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Israel/Palestine",""

Her 14-year-old son, Ali, had disappeared one day in March 1991, after she had asked him to go to the river for water. Now, just as quickly as the hope had risen that she would finally discover his fate, she started confronting the reality that she would never find his body. Around us was a scene of utter chaos and horror. Since early morning, a backhoe had been digging up the earth, often uncovering dozens of corpses in a single scoop. Bodies were piled everywhere. I noticed an artificial leg among the remains and, nearby, a corpse with crutches. Occasionally a piercing scream would rise above the crowd as a body was identified by relatives. Some of the victims were buried with identification cards in their wallets. Many in the desperate crowd, however, snatched at the slightest bit of hope, staring for hours at stained clothing in case they might recognize something belonging to a missing loved one. I saw one man carry off the remains of a body that he swore was his brother's simply because he found a pack of his brother's favorite cigarettes with the remains. Similar scenes are playing out all over Iraq. Exhuming a mass grave with a backhoe is like hunting pigeons with a tank. Sadly, most of the desperate civilians who flock to places like Mahawil will leave with uncertainty, and may have unwittingly destroyed their last chance to emotionally reunite with their missing relatives. In addition, the absence of forensic expertise at the graves means that evidence needed to prosecute the murderers of Iraq may also be destroyed. This is in sharp contrast to what happened in 1999 in Kosovo, when NATO forces worked with the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia to secure sites and enable exhumations almost as soon as Slobodan Milosevic's troops pulled out. As soon as possible, the international community must organize a similar process to aid Iraqi families, to allow at least a possibility for proper identification and preservation of evidence. In the meantime, coalition forces must protect the graves. When I spoke to a Marine commander here, he said his orders were to """"secure"""" and """"assist"""" at scenes of war crimes. Apparently, this meant securing the sites where crimes were committed against American soldiers, and assisting when the graves held the remains of Iraqis. And what did he mean by assisting, I asked. He told me that the troops had brought water to the site that day. As I left Balkis Hassun, the woman looking for her young son, she was softly crying, and soon I was also near tears. It is one thing to think abstractly of the number of people missing, quite another to sit down and talk to a woman about the memory of her beloved son. Looking at the marines standing on the nearby hill taking snapshots, I was at a loss to find words of hope.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

The New York-based monitoring organization also called on the Chinese government to release information about the men's whereabouts, the charges against them, and their current medical condition. The two prisoners are Tserang Dondrup, a layman also known as Jortse, and Tashi Phuntsog, a monk. They were seized over a year ago in connection with the case of a locally renowned monk, Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, who is under a death sentence with a two-year reprieve for """"incitement to separatism"""" and crimes related to his alleged role in a series of bombings in Sichuan province. Another man, Lobsang Dondrup, was executed in January 2003 on the same charges. No evidence connecting the men to the crimes has been made public. Tserang's condition has seriously deteriorated since his imprisonment, and there are grave concerns that he will not survive his sentence, believed to be somewhere between five and seven years. He is said to be having serious trouble seeing and has lost movement and flexibility in his legs. Tserang is in his late sixties or early seventies and was in good health at the time he was detained. """"Tserang Dondrup should have been released long ago, and be receiving the care he needs to survive,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"There is reason to fear that his current medical state is largely the result of prison conditions and of torture at the time of his arrest."""" Tserang was detained in early May 2002, a month after public security officials in Lithang (in Chinese referred to as Litang) arrested Tenzin Delek and four monks closely associated with him in a raid at Jamyang Choekhorling monastery. Although the current charges against him are unclear, it is known that in 2000, when authorities were preparing to detain Tenzin Delek, Tserang helped forestall the attempt by collecting some 20,000 signatures in support of Tenzin Delek. Tserang was a village head in the county of Nyagchukha, in Kartse (Chinese: Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan province at the time. Since his detention, he has been held at the Nyagchukha (Chinese: Yajiang) Detention Center. Ordinarily he would have been moved after sentencing, but it has been reported that the prison to which he was assigned refused to accept him because of his medical condition. Tashi Phuntsog, who reportedly received a seven-year sentence, may also be in fragile health. At the time of the raid, he was being treated for tuberculosis at a hospital in nearby Nyagchukha. Two weeks later, police officers took him directly from the hospital into detention. There is no information available about his current condition, the date of sentencing, the charges, or where he is imprisoned. """"If he was sick enough to need hospitalization before his arrest, he is unlikely to be getting the care he needs in detention,"""" Adams said. Chinese authorities have admitted that the ill-treatment of prisoners persists throughout China. Official secrecy surrounding arrests, incommunicado detention, closed trials, and the use of evidence obtained through forced confessions contributes to the use of torture and arbitrary legal proceedings. In Kartse, local authorities detained at least four men suspected of leaking information about the arrests, the trials, or the execution of Lobsang Dondrup. Three others served one-year reeducation through labor sentences for allegedly inciting """"splittism,"""" China's term for advocacy of Tibetan independence. """"It is time for Beijing to end its systematic repression of Tibetan activists and popular religious personalities,"""" said Adams.

At around 10:00 a.m. (local time) yesterday a powerful explosion ripped through the buildings of the local administration of Znamenskoe and the Federal Security Service and destroyed several houses in the immediate vicinity. According to press reports, the blast killed more than fifty people and wounded more than one hundred others. Many of the wounded are apparently in critical condition. Media reports cited officials in the pro-Moscow Chechen government as saying suicide bombers detonated an explosives-packed truck, after driving up to the buildings. Press reports suggest that many of the casualties were civilians and include six children under the age of twelve, officials of the local administration of Znamenskoe and local police officers. According to a Chechen government source quoted in the press, ten officers of the Federal Security Service (FSB) were also among the dead. As the FSB is in charge of Russia’s military operation in Chechnya, the FSB officers may have been combatants, making them legitimate targets for rebel attack. “Even if there were legitimate military targets in the buildings, this attack was a crime that caused enormous human suffering,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. In a similar attack, in December 2002 Chechen rebels set off bombs at the headquarters of the pro-Moscow government of Chechnya in Grozny, killing more than seventy people. In October, armed rebels took about 800 people hostage at a theater in Moscow and threatened to kill them all. Rebels have also pursued a vicious assassination campaign against Chechen civil servants, policemen and religious clergymen cooperating with the Russian authorities, killing dozens each year.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Some Iraqis believe that refugees in their country benefited from preferential treatment under Saddam Hussein's government. More than 500 of some 1,500 new refugees who have made their way to Jordan are Palestinians.     Based on research in Baghdad and Jordan, the 22-page Human Rights Watch report details the abuses against refugees and foreigners in Iraq, as well as their treatment upon arrival in Jordan.     """"The lack of security endangers everyone in Iraq, but refugees and other foreigners are especially vulnerable,"""" said Senior Emergencies Researcher Peter Bouckaert. """"Now these people find themselves refugees once again, without a lasting solution in sight.""""     Housing is frequently the pretext for the violence and harassment. Many landlords, forced by the previous government to take Palestinian tenants at discounted rates, are taking advantage of the breakdown in law and order to evict Palestinian tenants from their homes or to extort unrealistic rent increases from them. In other cases, violence and threats have come from individuals who seem to have no legitimate claim to the property.     Khairiyya Shafiq Ali and her family were threatened on four occasions by small groups of three to five people armed with machine guns and rifles. She told Human Rights Watch about the threats that made her flee to Jordan: """"They said, 'Either you leave your home or pay 300,000 dinars a month' (about $150). They threatened they would empty their guns in our head. They started after the fall of the government, approximately a week after. ...They shot bullets at our house. They told us, 'Saddam is gone, you are nothing here. You own nothing in Iraq. If you want to leave, take only your clothes.""""     Nazima Sulaiman, age 50, fled Baghdad with her family after unknown attackers threw explosive devices into her house, killing an infant baby and injuring six others, including three of Nazima Sulaiman's children. The attack came two days after fifteen armed men came to the house and threatened the family. """"They told us 'This home is for Iraqis, you own nothing. Saddam was protecting you. Now ask Saddam to find you another home,'"""" Nazima Sulaiman told Human Rights Watch. """"Had we known they were serious, we would have gone.""""     """"It's not just Palestinians who have become refugees twice over,"""" said Bouckaert. """"Armed groups in Iraq are targeting other foreigners, some of whom also may be refugees.""""     In Jordan, Human Rights Watch also interviewed victims from Sudan and Somalia who fled threats and incidents of insecurity. One twenty-three year old Somali man, wounded in a U.S. coalition strike on Baghdad on April 9, was threatened in his hospital bed. When the government of Saddam Hussein collapsed in Baghdad, angry armed civilians came to him three times, asked how much money he had received from the Iraqi government, and threatened to kill him. Other Iraqis intervened, but when Muhammad's wound had healed, they advised him to leave Iraq, because the situation became too dangerous for foreigners.     Iranian Kurds living in a refugee camp west of Baghdad also fled to Jordan when police who had previously guarded the camp stopped coming to work. After Baghdad was surrounded, police guards even told one Iranian Kurd that looters would come for them.     Human Rights Watch criticized Jordanian authorities for limiting refugees' entry to Jordan and for holding firm to a mid-June deadline, originally proposed by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, for their departure. To gain entry to camps inside the Jordanian border, the Palestinians were forced to sign vaguely worded documents permitting their repatriation to Iraq, whereas Iranian refugees have been completely barred from entering Jordan.     """"Coalition forces are doing little to ensure the security of anyone in Iraq, let alone these vulnerable populations,"""" said Bouckaert. """"Jordan has an obligation to protect refugees who flee to its borders.""""     Some non-citizens who fled Iraq to Jordan have already returned to their countries of origin. Their treatment raises concerns under international refugee law. In March, Jordanian officials and the International Organization on Migration allowed Sudanese government representatives access to a group of Sudanese who had been reluctant to return to Sudan. Other non-citizens were sent home within a seventy-two hour time limit after arriving in Jordan, raising concerns about whether they had adequate time or information to decide whether going home was safe for them and their families.     Over one thousand Iranian Kurds, refugees from a camp outside Baghdad who fled after threats and raids by bands of threatening men, are still stuck in a piece of desert that neither Jordan nor coalition forces are policing near the Jordanian border. In this no-mans-land, battered by sandstorms and with little shelter from the scorching desert heat, many suffer from a variety of diseases due to poor sanitation and shortage of clean drinking water.     Human Rights Watch urged the United States and its allies as the occupying power to prevent human rights abuses against vulnerable populations in Iraq, including refugees and other non-nationals.     Human Rights Watch also recommended that Jordan provide immediate protection and assistance to all refugees, including those currently trapped near the Jordanian border in accordance with international refugee law standards.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, Jordan","Refugees and Migrants"

Our government supports needle exchange, has recommended the legalization of marijuana, and is allowing the first trial use of prescription heroin in North America. So when I moved from Toronto last year to work for Human Rights Watch in New York, the last thing I expected was to be reporting on Canada's abuse of drug users. That was before April 7, which marked the beginning of the Vancouver police department's """"citywide enforcement team,"""" a three-month campaign to rid the streets of Vancouver's Downtown Eastside of drug traffickers and """"restore order to a community in distress."""" In practice, this has meant a severe crackdown against drug users, not drug traffickers. Visiting Vancouver recently, a colleague and I documented instances of excessive use of force, illegal search and seizure, and harassment of people never charged with dealing drugs. We saw an African Canadian man strip-searched in a busy street while he vomited from the police's pepper spray. We saw officers on horseback search the possessions of people who were never told why they'd been stopped. Police crackdowns can drive drug users away from life-saving outreach services, increase overdose deaths, and even ignite turf wars among drug traffickers. That's why the city elected Mayor Larry Campbell, an ex-coroner who promised to fight illegal drug use with the """"four pillars"""" of treatment, prevention, law enforcement, and harm reduction. Harm reduction means things like needle exchange and """"safe injection sites"""" -- places where drug users can inject under the supervision of trained medical personnel, rather than in the alleys of the Downtown Eastside. During the election, Mr. Campbell promised that a safe injection site would open by January. Today, frustrated activists are running an illegal site, while the proposed official site remains locked. Outside, police patrol the streets in triple the numbers of their ordinary force. Mr. Campbell says it doesn't matter which pillar you start with, as long as you implement them all. But unleashing law enforcement without guaranteeing access to harm-reduction services can be fatal. Needle exchange is proven to reduce HIV infection among drug users without increasing drug use or drug-related crime. Vancouver exchangers say that since the beginning of the police crackdown, they have distributed only a fraction of their usual number of sterile syringes. Fearing arrest, injectors stay away from exchange points; needles they do turn in have been reused so many times, the numbers have worn off. Vancouver suffers from what may be North America's worst HIV/AIDS epidemic. As many as 40 per cent of the Downtown Eastside's 5,000 drug users are HIV-positive. One police commander told me that AIDS activists should care more about the safety of the area's other residents. But AIDS activists pick up used syringes, find shelter for people with AIDS, and provide testing and counselling. They teach the public about infectious disease, patrol alleys to ensure people aren't overdosing, and exchange syringes in areas where no health-care worker would dare venture. All of these services are being interrupted during the current police campaign. AIDS activists aren't telling the police not to do their job. They just want to do their own. * Jonathan Cohen is author of Human Rights Watch's new report, Abusing the User: Police Misconduct, Harm Reduction and HIV/AIDS in Vancouver.","Americas, Canada","Health, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Mike was the Washington Director for the Asia division. He died of natural causes in Washington, D.C. on May 1. He was 53. Mike has left a void that simply cannot be filled -- not only as a powerful advocate for human rights, but also as a colleague and friend whose infectious energy, and passion for social justice inspired us all.  In his 13 years with Human Rights Watch, Mike was the leading advocate in the United States on human rights in Asia. His depth and breadth of knowledge was astounding. He was widely respected for his expertise on China, Japan's emerging global role, the World Bank and human rights, trade policy and worker rights, and US foreign policy in Asia. He was particularly engaged in seeking accountability for the 1989 Chinese military crackdown in Tiananmen Square, getting assistance to North Korean refugees, denying funding to abusive security forces across Asia, including Burma and Indonesia, and in defending religious freedom for minorities from Tibetans in China to Montagnards in Vietnam. In the past several years, Mike was also increasingly engaged in South Asian affairs, from the humanitarian consequences of the war in Afghanistan, to the human rights consequences of the military coup in Pakistan and the rise of religious intolerance in India.  Mike, who grew up in Connecticut, was the grandson of Polish immigrants, and an avid Bruce Springsteen fan. With his white short sleeve dress shirts, yellow ties, and contagious laugh, he used far more than his fair share of exclamation points!! Colleagues joked that if you could harness Mike's energy, it would power a small city. There's no one in D.C. who didn't know him, and no one in military fatigues in Asia who didn't have reason to fear him. He was late for every meeting, but only because he was saving the world on the other line. No email went unanswered, no phone call went unreturned, and no opportunity to make a difference was ever passed up. He has changed and saved the lives of so many.  For those who didn't know Mike, a comment from Human Rights Watch's former Asia Director Sidney Jones sums up the difference he made in so many people's lives:  """"Mike has become an institution in DC. I have people I barely know who, once they know I'm from Human Rights Watch, begin to tell me how Mike is a national treasure; how effective he is, and how knowledgeable and well plugged-in. NGO colleagues from India to Indonesia know that by going through Mike, they can get access to more and higher-level officials than they can by going through anyone else. Mike's ability to trade information is by now legendary. If he'd gone into the stock market, he could have made a killing. He gets a piece of human rights news or gossip, floats it, and watches it circulate as everybody in a position to check it chases it down, and then waits until they call him back with the facts, grateful for the heads up he's given them.""""  Mike first became involved in the human rights movement as a Vietnam war protestor in the 1970s and an anti-nuclear demonstrator in the 1980s. He began working at Amnesty International USA in the mid-1980's, then went on to work on the staff of the Amnesty International Secretariat in London in 1988. In 1990, he became Washington Director for the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. Once a pre-school teacher, he continued to teach us all.  Though most of us are unable still to correctly spell his last name, we simply could not have gotten through each day without him. It is hard to imagine how we will.

We are appealing to you to urge the Nigerian government to do everything possible to prevent further outbreaks of violence in the next stages of the elections.   In a press release of 29 April, you welcomed the """"relative calm in which the elections took place."""" This statement does not reflect the climate that prevailed in several southern and southeastern states, where killings and other attacks by armed thugs sponsored by various political parties not only resulted in several deaths and injuries, but effectively prevented many voters from going to the polls at all. This was the case, for example, in Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers State in the south; violence and intimidation were also widespread in Enugu and other parts of the southeast. The fact that large-scale violence did not break out across the whole country does not lessen the gravity of these incidents where they occurred. Likewise, your statement does not take into account the widespread violence across Nigeria in the months leading up to the elections, which contributed to an atmosphere of fear and tension in some areas on the election days.   While the United Kingdom government has rightly expressed concern about reports of fraud and irregularities observed in the elections and encouraged opposition parties to resort to legal methods of redress, rather than violence, the press release of 29 April fails to call upon Nigerian government and judicial authorities to identify and bring to justice the individuals responsible for the many incidents of violence which have already occurred in the period leading up to and during the elections, including crimes committed by supporters of the ruling People's Democratic Party.   In April 2003, Human Rights Watch published a report on pre-election violence, entitled """"Testing Democracy: Political Violence in Nigeria"""", which documented numerous incidents of political violence across the country since around the middle of 2002. In the majority of these cases, no one has been prosecuted.   One of our fundamental recommendations to the Nigerian government was to put an end to the impunity that has protected the perpetrators. By demonstrating a concrete commitment to the prosecution of those responsible for these crimes, the government would have sent a clear message to those contemplating violence as a means to victory during the actual elections, and could have prevented some of the incidents that marred the elections of April.   We are disappointed to note that despite the presence of Nigerian and foreign observers during the elections, many of whom noted incidents of violence in the south and southeastern states, the United Kingdom government has not denounced this violence, choosing instead to put a positive gloss on the elections. We are worried that this kind of statement sends the wrong signal to the Nigerian government and may give the impression that the United Kingdom government is prepared to overlook certain human rights abuses in the interests of maintaining good relations with Nigeria. While we support your call to opposition parties to refrain from acts of post-electoral violence, this does not address the serious incidents of violence that have already been committed. The need to bring to justice those responsible without delay should be articulated clearly and publicly at the international level, regardless of political or other considerations.   There is an urgent need to reiterate this message to the Nigerian government now, in order to prevent similar incidents of violence in the 3 May elections for state houses of assembly and local government elections provisionally scheduled for June. As one of Nigeria's most important Western partners, the United Kingdom government is in an excellent position to reinforce this point and to do so publicly. We are appealing to you to remind the Nigerian government of its responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to take immediate action to prevent further violence and intimidation in the remaining stages of the elections.

The Bank’s founding document gives it a mandate to promote development in those countries in the region that are committed to the “fundamental principles of multiparty democracy, the rule of law, human rights and market economics.” Uzbekistan satisfies none of these criteria. The Bank has faced significant criticism for its decision to grant the Uzbek government the political prestige and financial benefit of hosting its annual meeting, attended each year by some 2000 finance ministers, government officials, bankers, and businesspeople. A broad campaign by non-governmental groups, launched a year ago by Human Rights Watch and over fifty partners, warned the EBRD that going ahead with the meeting without requiring any concessions in exchange would leave the Uzbek government to flag it as an endorsement of its repressive policies. In fact, coverage of the upcoming meeting in Uzbekistan’s government-controlled media has cast it just as anyone even remotely familiar with authoritarian regimes would have expected. A March 18 television broadcast by “Akhborot” told Uzbek viewers that “[t]he EBRD does not cooperate with just any country because it sets it own conditions of principle, and a country wishing to receive financial aid from the organization should accept them…. Fruitful cooperation between Uzbekistan and the EBRD shows that Uzbekistan has gained a great deal of trust in this respect. Another important point is that the forthcoming annual meeting of the Board of Governors of the EBRD will be held in Tashkent. This fact is further proof that Uzbekistan’s prestige on the international arena is growing….” Concern that the Tashkent meeting might prove counterproductive has been echoed by many voices in the international community. In separate statements issued during the past year, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, the U.S. Senate, and the E.U. following its January Cooperation Council meeting with Uzbekistan all emphasized the importance of seeing progress in Uzbekistan prior to the May 2003 meeting. The Bank has proven reluctant to heed these calls and press for specific reform in advance of the meeting. Its President, Jean Lemierre, has repeatedly emphasized that the meeting is “not an endorsement,” but “an incentive to make progress.” Yet the Bank has failed to translate this statement of principle into a requirement of practical steps toward reform before the meeting convenes. As a result, the Bank has lost valuable time and squandered much of the leverage for reform it had. In just the past twelve months, while Bank officials dithered about linking the meeting to reform, at least eight prisoners were killed, apparently from torture, and seven human rights defenders were detained for peacefully promoting reform. If the upcoming meeting is to have any positive impact on the political and economic development of Uzbekistan, it is now incumbent upon the Bank and its shareholder governments to use the meeting to identify specific reforms expected as a condition of further engagement, and after the meeting is over, to monitor and insist upon Uzbekistan’s compliance. During the meeting itself, the key moment will be the opening session of the Board of Governors’ meeting, when the Bank’s president, followed by a senior representative of each shareholder government – usually the minister of finance, or equivalent – delivers a speech. Each shareholder government’s statement should send a strong signal to the host government, and the public at large – not least representatives from Uzbek civil society who will be listening carefully – about the significance the Bank’s decision-makers attach to the respect for human rights and democracy as part of their engagement. Governors’ speeches should reiterate the benchmarks for reform identified in the Bank’s recently adopted country strategy for Uzbekistan and question the Uzbek government on the progress it has made in meeting them. They should address restrictions imposed on the operation of civil society groups and inquire about the reasons why most Uzbek human rights NGOs attending the meeting, such as the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan, Mazlum, and the Committee of Legal Assistance to Prisoners, remain “illegal.” They should express concern about the arrests of seven human rights defenders in 2002 alone, including the forcible detention of Elena Urlaeva in a closed psychiatric ward in Tashkent. They should call for the release of those arbitrarily detained human rights defenders who remain in prison, including Tursunbai Utamuratov, Jura Muradov, Musulmankul Khamraev, and Norpulat Rajapov, and deplore these defenders’ absence from the meeting. Governors should further ask about the estimated 6,500 religious and political prisoners serving lengthy sentences in Uzbekistan’s prisons, where torture is rampant and disease rife. They should not fail to note the conclusion by Theo van Boven, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture, that torture is “systematic” in Uzbekistan, and call on the Uzbek government to implement his recommendations without delay. They should demand that what they have just said be accurately depicted in the local press, which continues to be subjected to strict government controls. Prominent Finns have a leading role to play in highlighting human rights concerns in Uzbekistan at the meeting itself, and in ensuring adequate follow-up to rhetorical statements of commitment made by the international community in Tashkent. In March, Finland’s Under-Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, Johnny Åkerholm, was appointed Secretary General of the EBRD, and former President Martti Ahtisaari was named Special Envoy to Central Asia of the Chair-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe – the principal intergovernmental monitoring body on whom the EBRD relies for its political assessments. Surely a forceful and unequivocal clarification of what drove the EBRD’s Board of Governors to give its stamp of approval to Tashkent as the venue of its upcoming annual meeting is warranted. Bank and shareholder government officials should emphasize that the choice of Tashkent is a test of Uzbek government will to reform, not a reward for current practices, before, during, and long after the meeting. As for the Bank’s engagement more generally, there is a useful lesson to be learned from this experience: political and economic benefits serve as a more effective incentive for reform if linked to the required reform before being granted, rather than after the fact. That is, the Bank would almost certainly have achieved a lot more in terms of human rights improvements had it told the Uzbek authorities that it would be pleased to have them host one of its annual meetings as soon as their record on democracy and human rights met the standards required by the Bank’s founding principles, and not before. The Bank should simply have made clear that its founding document would not allow for a meeting in Tashkent until significant improvements could be seen in the Uzbek government’s human rights record. That would have been a real incentive for progress, with no risk of turning the exercise into an endorsement of existing, repressive policies. With this course of action no longer an option, the Bank and its shareholders will have to redouble efforts to make the most of the leverage at hand. This entails being outspoken about human rights concerns at the meeting itself, and engaging in serious follow-up to ensure that pressure for reform will not relent after the meeting is over.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"

Will the 'wary against terror and the doctrine of preemption change those rules - and to whose advantage?  The laws on the conduct of war, a topic usually confined to arcane military journals, have marched into the public spotlight. This prominence is because of US military intervention in response to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. In the early days of the Iraq war, Human Rights Watch, a non-governmental monitor of adherence to these laws, was swamped with hundreds of press calls; many focused on allied compliance. This was all the more remarkable given Iraq's well-known record of deploying chemical weapons, torturing prisoners of war, and ruthlessly slaughtering civilians.  What has led to scepticism about American intentions with regard to the well-established precepts of international humanitarian law? There is an increasing divergence between American and European understanding of these rules, and a suspicion that the Americans, indeed, would prefer to be exempt when convenient. To understand the growing rift, it is necessary to look at changing assumptions about war.  AMERICAN WAR, AMERICAN TASTE  The US has evolved a style of war-fare that to some extent reflects American tastes: high-tech, efficient, and with a high sense of virtue. In recent interventions, it marshalled overwhelming force and aimed to keep its timetable for combat as short as possible, to avert domestic resistance, keep casualties low, and deny the enemy time to adapt tactics. Victory was not in question, only whether it would come in days or weeks - hence the domestic American 'shock and awe' when Iraq did not instantly collapse and cheering crowds took some time to materialise.  Several other ideas are conditioning American attitudes. One is the perception that the enemy is invariably a rogue, that is, without any intention of following civilised standards of conduct, and it is dangerous to be too scrupulous. Another is the administration's belief that critics of military practices lack moral force as they are bystanders, unwilling to credit the US as the only power able and willing to I intervene against terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.  This is a different backdrop from the context in which the laws of war evolved. They are a remarkable pact crafted by military leaders and humanitarians to limit the methods and means of war and thereby human suffering. If the outcome and duration of war are assumed to be often unpredictable, reciprocity - the expectation that your enemies will treat your forces and your population as you treat theirs - is an important encouragement to respect for the rules. The Geneva Conventions and their protocols lean towards universal application and away from notions of just war - the rules apply to all international armed conflicts, whether declared wars or not, and equally to aggressor and defender.  The current doctrine of 'effects-based operations' has refocused American military strategy from battlefield operations to end results, including the political objectives of war. Some favoured means to these ends include precision attacks against the enemy's sources of political support, psychological warfare, special forces, and combined strategies designed to overwhelm the enemy's ability to resist.  The core tenet of international humanitarian law - the distinction between combatants and non-combatants - does not fit smoothly into this doctrine. Civilians are among the sources of political support for any government. The US has directed attacks against economic backers of enemy leaders, and insisted that civilian morale is a legitimate target in war, by attacking broadcasting stations that appear to serve no military function other that purveying propaganda to the population.  International humanitarian law strictly prohibits attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure. The problem is not that such attacks cannot produce military advantage - they well may provoke internal rebellion - but that once this taboo is breached, there is no limit to the harm that may be inflicted on civilians to sap the will to fight. Why not deploy nuclear weapons to wrap things up swiftly? While no country has used this rationale vis-a-vis Iraq, it is disturbing that scenarios for nuclear deployment found their way into the Pentagon's 2002 Nuclear Posture Review, and that American and British leaders stated that nuclear weapons might be used against Iraq should there be a chemical or biological attack.  Awareness that the US may have to foot the bill for restoring civilian infrastructure may have averted the destruction of arguably military targets where enormous civilian suffering would result, such as Iraq's electrical grid. On the other hand, faith in the accuracy of precision weapons may be encouraging strategists to expand the target list increasingly into residential areas, where collateral civilian death is predictable.  The traditional rule of proportionality, under which an attack is unlawful if the expected damage to civilian life and property would be excessive in relation to the direct and concrete military advantage to be gained, is also challenged in the new war paradigm. America, and to some degree Britain, wish to equate the idea of an 'attack' not with an attack on a specific target but with an entire campaign, an overall military objective, or even a political objective such as regime change. Some may find this rational in the context of one-week wars. But most support the traditional view because estimating the acceptable level of civilian death only in relation to indeterminate and ultimate victory would allow horrifically disproportionate casualties along the way.  ABOVE THE LAW?  There are some areas where the unilateral spin the US gave the law looked like a drift away from law itself. While it was quick to denounce the use of human shields by Iraq as a war crime, Washington announced that it would not consider volunteers for this dubious mission as civilians whose presence might deter attacks. Likewise, the US lost enormous credibility to speak in defence of prisoner of war rights when it decided to deny even the right to independent judicial determination of that status to the Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners it transported to Guantanamo Bay.  The US return to its past practice of using tribunals, rather than politicians, to determine the prisoner of war status of captured Iraqis was no doubt a relief to the British, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and many in the Pentagon.  When US Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld rightly condemned Iraq's practice of torturing prisoners of war or broadcasting their interrogation, the public was immediately reminded that Washington had failed to prevent the broadcast of footage of Iraqi prisoners, and had never responded to reports that it countenanced torture of those detained in Afghanistan and Pakistan, either at the Bagram base or at the hands of allies.  President George Bush's putative war' against terrorism contributed to an idiosyncratic view of the law. Apparently Washington sees no end to the war on Al Qaeda and similar groups, justifying global military strikes and endless detention of combatants. At the same time, it shows little taste for the laws demands on an occupying force, as shown by its reluctance to commit the resources necessary to actually ensure security and accountability throughout Afghanistan, and its scant preparation for similar tasks in Iraq.  Some believe that the old rules, framed for old wars, need revision or at least reinterpretation. In January, the Swiss government, as a new UN member seeking to assert its historic interest in international humanitarian law, convened a meeting of states and experts on contested areas of this law with a view towards their 'development; a term many took to mean 'weakening. Protests from European governments, and US reluctance to expose itself to criticism, ultimately produced a low-key conference that skirted the most controversial views. But the question lingers: can international humanitarian law thrive when the world's greatest power acts as though exempt from standard understandings of these laws?  In hindsight, the war in Iraq looks less novel, with drawn-out engagements, guerilla tactics and difficult conditions of occupation. Many bedrock assumptions of the 'new' style of war remain unproven. Would a military intervention so overwhelming as to trigger the immediate collapse of the government actually produce fewer casualties? Does the availability of precision weapons guarantee fewer civilian deaths, or that more bombs are dropped in more situations? While it does try to forecast collateral damage, the US military seldom analyses afterwards the actual suffering caused by its actions, leaving that to reporters and humanitarians.  The most cogent argument against the dilution of standards is that global leaders I lead by example, and the example of exceptionalism undermines the rule of law. Wider adoption of American attitudes towards international humanitarian law would spell disaster for civilians the world over, in wars between forces less technically adept and less responsive to democratic outrage. It is not hard to imagine other troops claiming they are justified in attacking civilians, ignoring massive civilian loss and abusing prisoners - all in the name of some worthy goal, no doubt.  Washington complains it is unfairly held to a higher standard of conduct as the sole superpower. Yet popular expectations shape the laws of war, as the nineteenthcentury Russian diplomat Fyodor Martens recognised in his famous clause that has been incorporated into many treaties. The law, he wrote, includes principles derived `from the laws of humanity and the requirements of public conscience: Why then should America, at the height of its prowess, when it can most afford to set the highest standard of military conduct, edge away from time-honoured principles that impose constraints of humanity upon slaughter?","United States",""

Past monthly updates are archived at https://www.hrw.org/update.   ----THE IRAQI WAR AND ITS AFTERMATH With active hostilities in Iraq on the wane, Human Rights Watch is beginning a new phase of our research and advocacy on the conflict - addressing issues of post-war reconstruction, and analyzing how the war itself was conducted so as to draw lessons for the future. Prior to the war, we alerted the media and policymakers to key human rights problems that might arise, including the need to take proactive steps to avoid possible slaughter by Iraqi government or opposition troops, to adopt specified precautions to minimize harm to civilians, to reduce the prospect of ethnic and communal conflict, to address the humanitarian needs of those displaced by the war, and to establish a justice system to bring to justice those responsible for past abuses. We helped to encourage President Bush to make repeated vows that anyone who carried out atrocities during the war would be prosecuted - an important step for convincing Iraqi troops not to carry out any orders for mass murder that might have been delivered. Unfortunately, we did not succeed in convincing the U.S. government not to proceed to war without sufficient troops to maintain the peace and prevent the looting and lawlessness that followed the toppling of Saddam Hussein's government. Once the war started, Human Rights Watch maintained a presence in Iraqi Kurdistan and on the borders of Iraq, where we monitored the conduct of the war as well as issues of forced displacement, the treatment of prisoners, and ethnic and communal conflict. We issued numerous background briefings on the requirements of the laws of war and posted them on our Web site in multiple languages - all in an effort to pressure the parties to the conflict to comply with these obligations. We condemned such Iraqi practices as disguising fighters as civilians and hiding military equipment and personnel in civilian areas. As for the United States and its allies, we were the first to report on their misuse of cluster bombs. We also issued numerous statements on the duties of the United States as an occupying power, the human rights considerations involved in the management of Iraq's oil reserves, and the conditions that must be met for the establishment of a credible justice system. Human Rights Watch will remain an objective source of information about developments in Iraq. We have a long history of documenting the crimes of Saddam Hussein; we were not """"embedded"""" as journalists with the military; and we did not take a position on the U.S. military action. Maintaining this impartial stance continues to be the foundation of our research and advocacy. Human Rights Watch currently has three teams of researchers in and around Iraq. The team in Baghdad is investigating civilian deaths and the work being done by the occupying powers to assume their responsibilities under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The team in Basra is focused on trying to prevent potential violence and reprisal killings among the large number of competing religious and political groups in southern Iraq. The third team is currently in Basra and will be traveling around the country on a detailed study of civilian casualties resulting from military operations on all sides of the conflict. All three teams will also collect newly emerging information on the horrendous atrocities of Saddam Hussein's reign. A recently completed investigation in northern Iraq focused on trying to prevent ethnic and communal violence between Kurds and Arabs around the oil-rich town of Kirkuk. Kirkuk is where Saddam Hussein's forced Arabization policy had displaced tens of thousands of Kurds from their homes; their desire to return to houses now often occupied by Arabs makes Kirkuk an obvious tinderbox. Meanwhile, on April 10, Human Rights Watch testified before the U.S. Senate Governmental Affairs Committee on the need to have an international tribunal prosecute past human rights abuses committed in Iraq. Several days later, the U.S. Congress passed a supplemental appropriations bill. One provision of the bill sets aside $10,000,000 for an international tribunal, as well as related investigations, on the Iraqi government's genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Read the text of the testimony at https://www.hrw.org/press/2003/04/iraq041003tst.htm Human Rights Watch would like to thank the many individuals who responded to our emergency appeal on Iraq. Your contributions have made possible this urgent, ongoing work. For more news and information on Iraq, visit https://www.hrw.org/campaigns/iraq   ----COMMITMENT TO ESTABLISH PROGRAM ON SEXUAL ABUSE IN ZAMBIA HRW recently received a letter from the office of the President of Zambia, Levy Mwanawasa, stating that following his review of our report on sexual abuse of girls in Zambia and how this exposes them to HIV infection, he ordered the establishment of an interministeral program on the sexual abuse of girls. HRW will be closely following up on this commitment by monitoring if, when and how the program will be established.

Yáñez was facing a suspended prison sentence for allegedly insulting the judiciary on a television chat show. Human Rights Watch had condemned Yáñez's prosecution, citing the case frequently in its campaign for the repeal of Chile's law on """"insult to authority"""" (article 263 of the Criminal Code). A bill for the law's repeal is currently before the Chilean Congress.

Hundreds have apparently been arrested since March 20, 2003. The Egyptian media reported on March 30 that, by order of the Public Prosecutor, seventy-one persons charged before prosecutors were to be released on bail, although all charges would still stand. After pressure from Human Rights Watch, the report for the Senate version of the supplemental appropriations bill, granting Egypt $300,000,000 in bilateral economic assistance, included language that expressed concern regarding the """"recent crackdown on Egyptian demonstrators, including the reported use of torture by police officials."""" In addition, the State Department was required to submit a report to the Appropriations Committees on Egypt's progress in meeting its obligations as a party to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment of Punishment. WHAT YOU CAN DO Please send letters to Egyptian authorities calling on them to release information about all those detained in connection with anti-war demonstrations since March 20, 2001, as well as any charges against them; free any persons arrested in connection with the demonstrations who are still detained unless they are promptly charged with a recognizable criminal offence; conduct a full investigation into charges of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and bring to justice those responsible.

HRW pushed for this resolution over a period of months, beginning with the publication of HRW's report last November on North Korean refugees in China. The report included action in Geneva as one of its key recommendations. HRW worked with the EU, chief sponsor of the resolution, South Korea, Japan, the United States and other key players to suggest text and urge adoption of a strong, constructive measure. The resolution passed 28-10 with 14 abstaining (and South Korea present but not voting). Read the report and HRW briefing paper on North Korea for the Commission on Human Rights at https://www.hrw.org/asia/north-korea Human Rights Watch also pressed successfully for the Commission to adopt a first-ever resolution on Turkmenistan, another closed and repressive regime. The resolution was adopted 23-16 with 14 abstaining. It expressed """"grave concern"""" about serious abuses of human rights in Turkmenistan, and pressed the Turkmen government to undertake systemic reforms to fully comply with its international human rights obligations. It """"deplore[d]"""" the due process violations and other serious abuses suffered by those detained in relation to the November 25 assassination attempt of the country's president, and called on the Turkmen government to urgently grant independent bodies, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, access to those detained. It also called on the Turkmen government to ensure that those found guilty of human rights violations be brought to justice; to lift restrictions on the operation of civil society groups; to cooperate with and implement recommendations from various international rights officials. Read the HRW briefing paper on Turkmenistan for the Commission on Human Rights at https://www.hrw.org/un/chr59/omnibus.htm The Commission on Human Rights session was disappointing, however, on many other important issues.

With Libya as its chair, and China, Saudi Arabia and Zimbabwe among its voting members, it is hardly surprising that many of the world's most flagrant human rights abusers – even those lacking seats on the commission – tend to escape its condemnation. The situation is getting worse. Cuba's membership on the commission was set to expire but renewed for another term on Tuesday when the UN body, meeting in New York, voted on the issue. This was a stark testament to the commission's weakened credibility and degraded membership standards.   Cuba did not release any political prisoners, or grant any breathing room to the country's beleaguered human rights activists, or make even the most token gesture in support of human rights. The government of Fidel Castro evidently felt no need to moderate its repressive policies to ensure itself a seat on the commission.   To the contrary, Cuba flaunted its disregard of the commission's stated ideals. On March 18, the day after the commission opened its annual session in Geneva, state security agents began rounding up political dissidents, independent journalists, human rights advocates, independent librarians and others brave enough to challenge the Havana government's monopoly on truth. The arrests heralded Cuba's worst crackdown in decades.   In all, nearly 80 people were detained, including such prominent figures as Raúl Rivero, the poet and journalist, and Héctor Palacios, one of the leaders of Cuba's pro-democracy movement. The Cuban security forces also searched homes across the island, confiscating dissidents' fax machines, computers, typewriters and personal papers.   From April 3 to April 7, in a series of summary trials, the detainees were prosecuted under draconian legal provisions that ban actions meant to undermine the socialist system or support the U.S. economic embargo. Such laws criminalize a broad range of nonviolent statements of opinion, infringing fundamental rights of free expression.   A total of 75 detainees were convicted, receiving sentences of up to 28 years of imprisonment. The cumulative total of the sentences was a mind-boggling 1,454 years. There was not a single acquittal.   Meanwhile, back in Geneva, Cuba's representatives at the United Nations were busy reviewing human rights conditions around the world. They were also planning Cuba's re-election to the commission, a goal they just attained. Because Latin American countries proposed a slate of candidates, including Cuba, that was the same size as the number of commission seats allotted the region, Cuba's election was set.   Following such a severe crackdown, the country's re-election to the most high-profile UN human rights body represents a bitter defeat for the human rights ideal. Not only do Cuba's representatives manipulate the commission's work, the country's continued presence on the commission is an embarrassment.   This ugly outcome should prompt governments to take remedial action. Most importantly, in the long term, the governments that elect commission members should establish minimum standards for membership. Rather than electing human rights pariahs, governments should adopt rules that exclude at least the worst offenders from the commission.   Countries whose records the commission has condemned, which have failed to implement commission recommendations, which have refused to allow visits by commission investigators – or which, like Cuba, have done all of the above - should never again be considered proper candidates.","Americas, Cuba","United Nations"

The U.S. Department of Defense has acknowledged using nearly 1,500 air-dropped cluster bombs, but has not revealed any information about ground-launched cluster munitions, which may have been much more numerous. The U.K. Ministry of Defense has admitted to using more than 2,000 cluster munitions, but like the Pentagon, it has not provided detailed information that deminers need to clear “dud” submunitions, which pose hazards to civilians.  “The United States and United Kingdom need to come clean on what they’ve done with these weapons,” said Reuben Brigety, researcher with the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. “They are not doing all they can to protect civilians from the deadly after-effects of their cluster attacks.”  Submunitions from artillery projectiles and multiple launch rockets, as well as aircraft cluster bombs, may have produced tens of thousands of hazardous duds in numerous locations in Iraq, including urban areas, Brigety said. He urged the United States and United Kingdom to provide adequate warnings to civilians, including realistic images of dud submunitions, and assist in all ways possible with the clearance of cluster munition duds.  Mine action organizations and others in the humanitarian community have not received detailed information on the locations, numbers and types of cluster munitions used in combat in Iraq, including types used for the first time.  The U.K. Ministry of Defense admitted on April 24 that its forces had used 2,100 cluster munition artillery projectiles and at least 66 BL-755 cluster bombs in the conflict. In Yugoslavia/Kosovo, the United Kingdom used 500 cluster bombs, and in the 1991 Gulf War, it used 395 cluster bombs and an unknown number of surface-delivered cluster munitions.  The artillery projectile used by the United Kingdom, called the L20A1, contains 49 submunitions, each equipped with a self-destruct device, which the manufacturer claims reduces the dud rate to below 2 percent. The out-of-date BL-755 cluster bombs produced a large number of unexploded duds in combat operations in Kuwait and Yugoslavia/Kosovo. There have also been reports that U.K. ground forces used Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, which have a submunition dud rate of 16 percent or more.  Unlike the U.K., the U.S. has not revealed the number of ground-launched cluster munitions used in Iraq. An unnamed U.S. defense official told a reporter for Los Angles Times that the U.S. does not keep track of ground launched cluster munitions.  “If the Pentagon doesn’t keep track of ground-launched cluster munitions, it had better start,” said Brigety. “This information is very important, especially when the weapon has been improperly used in urban areas.”  Several of the ground-launched cluster munitions in service with U.S. and U.K. forces produce an unacceptably high percentage of de facto landmines when they fail to function on impact. Official U.S. data documents a minimum of 14 to 16 percent dud rates for common ground launched cluster munitions. These dud rates climb when the impact environment includes vegetation or structures.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/04/29/letter-president-aliev","Letter to President Aliev","Letter to President Aliev","","04/29/2003","I am writing to urge you to speak out against the ongoing campaign against Azerbaijani human rights defenders and nongovernmental human rights organizations, and to take immediate measures to stop it.  During the past week several of Azerbaijan’s leading human rights defenders and their families have been subjected to numerous incidents of physical harassment and intimidation, which followed two months of attacks against them in the mass media. We ask that you ensure that law enforcement agencies take appropriate measures against the perpetrators of violent acts and provide security to the human rights defenders targeted by the campaign. This is an urgent matter, as we learned yesterday that a private security company was obliged to withdraw its guard from the office of the Human Rights Center of Azerbaijan, one of the chief targets of the attacks, on instructions from the Ministry of National Security.  Attacks of April 23-28 An ANS television program, aired on April 22, immediately preceded the attacks. It criticized Eldar Zeynalov, chair of the Human Rights Center of Azerbaijan (HRCA) for comments attributed to him during a trip he was making at that time to Armenia and Nagorny-Karabakh, where he was to take part in an all-Caucasus forum of nongovernmental organizations. Two Azerbaijani civil society representatives took part in the television program, one of whom allegedly commented that people should make it uncomfortable for Eldar Zeynalov to walk on the street. The program broadcast Eldar Zeynalov’s home telephone number, after which his family immediately began to receive threatening telephone calls.  On April 23 a group of up to fifty people—members of the “Popular Front” party led by Gudrat Gasanguliev—picketed HRCA’s office in Baku. The crowd threw eggs at the walls and windows and emptied garbage outside the entrance door. They dispersed when police officers arrived. The group left a written document outside the office calling for Eldar Zeynalov to be prosecuted for treason. That afternoon, a group from the nongovernmental Organization for the Liberation of Karabakh (OLK) picketed HRCA’s office. Reportedly, they banged on the door and windows of the office. Zeynalov called the police, who later allowed several of the protestors and camera crews into his office. During heated discussion there, one of the protestors threatened to blow up Eldar Zeynalov, the office, and himself. Police officers resolved the situation by escorting all participants in the exchange to a police station.  The OLK was among several groups that picketed the HRCA office on April 24. Others were “Popular Front” led by Gudrat Gasanguliev, and two other political parties, Muasir Musavat and Umid. OLK members poured chlorine down the steps leading to the office basement. Others threw eggs, broke two windows, and burned on a wooden cross photographs of Zeynalov and of the Karabakh-Armenian leader Arkady Gukasian.  On April 25, a group of roughly thirty people bearing the flag of the governing Yeni Azerbaycan party picketed the HRCA office at midday, throwing eggs. When Mekhdi Mekhdiev, director of the Human Rights Resource Center, objected, two men in the crowd began to assault him, but were stopped by police. That morning Mekhdiev had closed his office after receiving a telephone call threatening that it would be attacked.  On April 26, a group of about ten youths briefly picketed the HRCA office, and burned an Armenian flag.  On April 28, about thirty people demonstrated outside the office of the Institute of Peace and Democracy, another nongovernmental human rights organization. The crowd—presumed to be from Yeni Azerbaycan—threw eggs, tried unsuccessfully to force the entrance door, and left after forty minutes. On the same day, Zeynalov’s neighbors reportedly attacked members of his family, accusing them of being Armenian. His sister-in-law alleged that they twisted her arm and threw potted plants at her and her father. In all of these incidents, demonstrators reportedly shouted that the human rights defenders were Armenians and traitors, and demanded that they leave or be expelled from Azerbaijan.  Police response The police response to the assaults has been ambivalent. They have to date contained the violence, but they have not investigated or prosecuted any of those who committed acts of violence or vandalism. On some occasions the police have obliged picketers to leave, and on other occasions they have stood by while crowds hurled eggs and other projectiles. This was the case, for example, on April 24: police intervened only after the attack was over, to bring in cleaners to tidy away its traces.  Police have failed to provide security to the staff of the offices under assault. They even refused to provide a police guard to protect HRCA in exchange for remuneration, although such arrangements with other Baku-based organizations are common. On April 25 HRCA concluded a one-month contract with a private security company. When HRCA inquired as to why the guard had not appeared yesterday morning, the company explained that the Ministry of National Security had instructed them to stop guarding the HRCA.  In an April 24 news broadcast, the Lider television station reported that the Ministry of the Interior planned to press criminal charges against Eldar Zeynalov, but provided no further detail. On April 27 Minister of the Interior Ramil Usubov, after three days of silence, told journalists that the Ministry had no basis on which to arrest Eldar Zeynalov, and said that only the Ministry of National Security could make a determination in such cases.  The Role of State and Pro-government Media Both state television and several private television stations that broadcast from the government’s perspective—such as ANS, Lider, and Space TV—have played an important role in initiating and sustaining the last week’s incidents. As noted above, the April 22 ANS program that broadcast Eldar Zeynalov’s home telephone number appears to have triggered the physical intimidation campaign. On April 24 an ANS news bulletin reportedly announced that protestors were due to assemble outside the HRCA office in an hour’s time, which may have served to encourage participants in the attack that subsequently occurred.  News reports have vilified Eldar Zeynalov and Leyla Yunus, chair of the Institute of Peace and Democracy, and have portrayed the attacks on their offices as manifestations of public outrage. Viewers have been told that there should be no place for these people in Azerbaijan, and that they are Armenians, with the apparent aim of stirring ethnic bias. Some television broadcasts have spliced material about Eldar Zeynalov with archive footage of the corpses of Azerbaijanis, killed by Armenian forces.  Official encouragement of attacks on human rights defenders The broader media context for this week’s attacks was set in February and March, when state and pro-government mass media frequently attacked several human rights defenders, chiefly Eldar Zeynalov and Leyla Yunus, accusing them of betraying national interests in favor of Armenia. Broadcasts and newspaper articles reportedly called for reprisals against them, income audits, criminal investigation, and expulsion from Azerbaijan.  On February 24 Ilham Aliev, a member of parliament and vice president of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan, gave this campaign this official imprimatur, denouncing domestic opponents of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline project. He spoke of the necessity to “take measures against” human rights defenders who had criticized the project. Although domestic critics of the project have objected to it largely on grounds of potential negative economic, social, or ecological impacts, he reportedly characterized their opposition as sabotage undertaken on behalf of Armenia, and named them “accomplices of our enemy.”  Yeni Azerbaycan has played a leading role in the incidents of physical intimidation during the past week. In an interview published by Sharg newspaper on April 25, Bahar Muradova, a member of parliament and of Yeni Azerbaycan’s political council stated the party’s plans to picket the HRCA office that day, and to do the same subsequently at the office of Leyla Yunus. They threw eggs at both offices.  Among the other groups that have picketed the HRCA office, the “Popular Front” led by Gudrat Gasanguliev is widely perceived to be a pro-government grouping. Its close connection with your government became apparent in January 2003. At that time, the Ministry of Justice registered it as the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party, thereby displacing the “reformist” wing of the Popular Front, which is an opposition party, and revoking the latter’s registration. This maneuver drew protest within Azerbaijan and criticism from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. On January 22 you reinstated the opposition party’s registration.  The latest events are the latest in a series of government actions taken since the middle of last year, which appear aimed at deterring human rights reporting in Azerbaijan. These have included unfavorable amendments made to the law on grants adopted in May 2002, and attempts to deter international and domestic human rights bodies from giving a full evaluation of the violence in Nardaran of June 2002.  We urge you reconsider this approach, and to begin with stopping the campaign of violence against Azerbaijan’s human rights defenders. I thank you for your attention to this urgent matter and welcome your response.

The use of such antipersonnel weapons in densely populated areas makes the risk of civilian casualties intolerably high under international law. Human Rights Watch responded to an April 27, 2003, ruling by Israel’s Supreme Court of Justice in a case brought by the Palestinian Center for Human Rights and Physicians for Human Rights - Israel. The court said that it would not intervene in the army’s choice of weapons because use of flechettes was not banned outright in international law.  “Flechettes may not be banned outright, but they should never be used in areas where there are large numbers of civilians,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “The Israeli Army doesn’t use them in the West Bank because of potential risks to civilians. It makes no sense to keep using them in Gaza, one of the most densely-populated areas on earth.”  Flechettes are razor-sharp 3.75mm darts released from canisters that explode in mid-air and spray thousands of them in an arc some 300 meters long and 90 meters wide. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) generally fires them in 105 mm tank shells. According to Jane’s Defence Weekly, the IDF is using a modified version of US-supplied M494 105mm APERS-T rounds, acquired in the 1970s.  Their wide “kill radius” renders flechettes particularly deadly. Their use in heavily populated areas contravenes two basic principles of the laws of war. The first is the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks, which means that forces cannot use weapons or mount attacks that do not or cannot distinguish between civilians and military objectives. The second is the requirement to take all feasible precautions to avoid or minimize harm to civilians when choosing method and means of attack.  The Gaza Strip has a population density of some 3,273 persons per square kilometer – eleven times that of the West Bank. Palestinian residential areas, Israeli settlements, and Israeli military installations exist in close proximity. Human Rights Watch, the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, B’tselem, and other organizations have documented multiple civilian deaths in Gaza as a result of flechette use.  “Although the IDF says it has guidelines, we don’t know what they are or what happens to those who don’t follow them,” Megally said. “The IDF record on investigating wrongdoing is abysmal. The IDF should stop flechette use in Gaza now.” The Supreme Court accepted the IDF’s statement that its use of flechettes did not deviate from strict but undisclosed internal army guidelines (The Israeli Supreme Court Sitting as the High Court of Justice High Court Ruling 8990). In fact, three days after flechettes killed three women and wounded three others from the al-Malalha family on June 9, 2001, Israeli army officials confirmed that the shelling, in a populated area between Gaza City and the Netzarim settlement had been a mistake (Israel: Dart Shells Pose Civilian Threat).  “The mistake is not just one incident but the policy of continued use of this weapon in a context inconsistent with the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks,” Megally said.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

April marks the one-year anniversary of the agreement that brought peace to mainland Angola in 2002. Both the largest opposition group, National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the government used child soldiers in the war. Children's rights groups have estimated that as many as 11,000 children were involved in the last years of the fighting. Some children received weapons and arms training and fought in the conflict. Many others acted as porters, cooks, spies and laborers.  """"These boys and girls have been victimized twice. First, they were robbed of their childhood as soldiers, and now they are denied access to government demobilization programs,"""" said Tony Tate, a researcher in the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These children-especially girls-are being forgotten in post-conflict Angola.""""  One year after the conflict ended in mainland Angola, some UNITA soldiers who are 18 or older have been incorporated into the national army and police. Others were demobilized in a national program and have received needed assistance. But child soldiers, many of whom performed the same duties as adults, were denied these benefits.  The use of children in armed conflict is in violation of Angolan and international law. Angola also has obligations to provide for the recovery and reintegration of all children affected by conflict.  Beyond the hardships of war, child soldiers were deprived of educational, vocational and developmental opportunities. For these reasons, child soldiers in particular need rehabilitation programs tailored to their specific experiences. Without assistance, they risk future manipulation, and are vulnerable to being taken into military service or illegal activities.  The 26-page report, Forgotten Fighters: Child Soldiers in Angola, details the hardships these children faced during the war and the abuses they suffered. UNITA soldiers regularly beat children for infractions and assigned them hazardous duties. UNITA combatants also sexually abused girls and assigned them as """"wives"""" to soldiers.  The government armed forces also used boys in the war, although in smaller numbers than UNITA. Boys served as fighters as well as mechanics, radio operators and porters.  Since the end of the war, child soldiers have received no direct assistance and rehabilitation in contravention of Angola's treaty obligations. Some programs have been set up to assist children generally but do not target or identify child soldiers specifically.  """"Existing community-based programs provide some relief but no provisions for child soldiers,"""" said Tate. """"Programs must be established that provide for their specific needs based on their experiences as soldiers in the war.""""  With the rainy season ending in the coming weeks, hundreds of thousands of displaced Angolans will return home. Many child soldiers currently residing in camps and transit centers will also be on the move. Identifying these children now and tracing them to their communities may be the only way to include them in future programs.  The World Bank has recently granted U.S. $33 million to assist the government with the rehabilitation of former combatants. Human Rights Watch said a larger portion of this grant should be channeled to help child soldiers. Children who fought in the conflict must first be identified and recognized in order for any tangible assistance to reach them.  In April 2002, the war ended on the mainland after decades of fighting. The infrastructure of the country lies in ruins with schools and health clinics destroyed and few qualified professionals to deliver services. The success of child soldier reintegration projects will be contingent on the government's increase of funding to provide basic services to all Angolans.","Africa, Angola","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

On April 29 and 30, the U.N. Economic and Social Council will vote to fill 24 slots at the 53-member commission, which has just finished its annual six-week session in Geneva. The U.N. body’s five regional groups each nominate candidates for membership in the commission, and three out of the five are uncontested this year.  Cuba and Russia, among others, are therefore assured election to another three-year term. The Cuban government is in the midst of its worst human rights crackdown in a decade, while Russia has failed for three years in a row to invite key U.N. monitors to investigate its conduct in Chechnya.  “Cuba and Russia each have very serious human rights problems and have failed to cooperate with the commission despite many resolutions against them,” said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch. “It’s outrageous that they should be rewarded for this performance with another term on the commission.”  Weschler criticized Latin American and East European countries that could have nominated additional candidates and made the election a contested one, but chose instead to countenance the election of Cuba and Russia from their regional groups.  The commission has a growing number of members with extremely poor human rights records, who increasingly operate as a bloc to defeat or eviscerate any human rights criticism of individual governments at the commission.  Human Rights Watch supports the establishment of minimum criteria for commission membership that would include: the ratification and basic observance of key human rights treaties; cooperation with U.N. human rights monitoring system, including standing invitations to U.N. rapporteurs; and a recent record that is free of commission criticism.  Several governments and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights have recently also highlighted the need for membership criteria.

Extensive research at five hospitals and morgues in Kirkuk and Mosul suggests that the high civilian tolls can be attributed to general lawlessness after the collapse of local authorities; the ready availability of weapons and ammunition; and the vast stores of ammunition and ammunition components left behind by the Iraqi military, including landmines, rocket-propelled grenades, and other explosives.  Many of the victims have been children who play with explosives or pick up unexploded ordnance (UXO) as toys and sustain serious injuries as a result.  “In some ways, the peace has proved more lethal than the war,” said Hania Mufti, London Director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  At the al-Zahrawri Hospital (formerly al-Jumhuri Hospital) in Mosul, for example, emergency room records show that three civilians were treated on April 22 after an unidentified person riding a motorbike tossed a grenade in their direction. Another ten patients were brought in that day after a looting incident in the Hawi al-Kanisa area of the city. Three of them later died of their gunshot wounds.  The Iraqi authorities stored up huge amounts of ammunition and small arms in homes, schools, and other sites in residential areas in the run-up to the war. At the al-Bayda’ Secondary School for Girls in Kirkuk, Human Rights Watch researchers on April 13 found one classroom still stacked with dozens of boxes of ammunition, including rocket-propelled grenades, 82mm and 100mm mortar shells, and 12.7mm machine gun bullets. The guard at the school told Human Rights Watch that the Iraqi military had brought the ammunition to the school about five or six days before the start of the war, leaving one sentry in the classroom, and that students had been obliged to attend their classes in these conditions.  Storing ammunition in a functioning school is a violation of international humanitarian law.  At the al-Razi Hospital (formerly Saddam Hospital) in Mosul, one doctor in the emergency ward told Human Rights Watch that during the coalition bombing raids, most civilian casualties were the result of ammunition left behind by the Iraqi army in and around the city.  “The [Iraqi] army placed ammunition and weapons in between houses and among civilians in preparation for the war,” the doctor said. “But the Americans did not attack these civilian areas. When the army withdrew, they left behind bombs, bullets, and machine guns. People, mostly children, picked these up and they exploded.”  The doctor said that he treated about fifteen burn cases every day in the course of an eight-hour shift, often children who were trying to light loose gunpowder.  Another doctor at al-Razi Hospital in Mosul said on April 21 that he was often treating “tens of cases daily,” mostly wounds sustained from landmines, exploding ammunition or bullets. He also said that Ba’ath Party loyalists were still present in the hospital and he could not speak freely, out of fear of reprisal attacks. “They are everywhere and they spy on us even now,” he said, “so you can imagine what it was like before.”  Injuries from sniper fire and hand grenades are still a major problem in Mosul, where the situation remains more volatile than in Kirkuk.  Doctors at the Azadi Hospital (formerly Saddam Hospital) in Kirkuk said that in the first three days after the city fell, they were treating around 70 patients every day, most of them civilians who had sustained bullet wounds, shrapnel wounds, and injuries caused by landmines and other explosives. Now, however, the numbers were falling to one or two a day, mostly children with burns on their faces and hands.  Anti-personnel landmines and ammunition are being found in holes dug in the ground in residential areas, while similar explosive materials were left strewn around the grounds of military bases on the perimeters of both Mosul and Kirkuk. The bases include the al-Khalid Garrison south of Kirkuk, a Republican Guard facility; and al-Ghazlani Garrison in Mosul.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

These are crime scenes, and the coalition forces, as occupying powers, must function as the police in Iraq right now. Mass graves will provide crucial evidence for tribunals the U.S. government has said should be established to prosecute the crimes. We were 25 miles west of Basra, looking out over a barren landscape where the earth was heaped into several mounds. Ali had come to dig for his son Mustafa's remains. Our Human Rights Watch team had come with him to begin assessing the mammoth task of coping with Iraq's brutal past. But Ali couldn't even approach the site, much less dig. The mounds were strewn with live mortar shells and other unexploded ordnance. Whoever dug those graves, if they are indeed graves, intended that the task of uncovering them would be as difficult as possible. And so it will be. More than 250,000 people were detained or murdered by the government of Saddam Hussein, and almost all of them have relatives who now want justice, or physical remains, or at the very least information about what happened to their loved ones. In the looting that followed the U.S.-led invasion, countless documents about arrests and executions were pilfered or destroyed. Some victims' families may take private revenge against officials of the old regime. Ali was motivated not by bloodlust but by a poignant need for emotional closure. Mustafa was a senior in high school when an armed gang came to the family's house and took him away, together with an older brother, on March 24, 1999. A Shiite uprising had recently shaken Basra, and the Baath Party was taking its revenge. Less than a month later, Jawad Ali came home from work to find his house ransacked and the rest of his family gone. He went to the jail and joined his relatives, to protect them as best he could. Ali and two of his children were held in Basra in a 12-by-18-foot room with 70 to 80 other people and one open toilet. They were released on Oct. 14, 1999, and found their home had been razed and that Jawad had lost his job as a teacher. This month, the looting of the Security Directorate in Basra yielded an interesting handwritten document, which is now posted at every mosque in town. """"Name,"""" """"Age,"""" """"Date Killed,"""" """"By Whom"""" read the categories across the top, and 140 victims' names are listed. The document suggests they were executed in groups, some by relatives of those who had been killed in the Shiite uprising and some by security officers. According to the document, Mustafa was shot by security officers on May 8, 1999. Was this bizarre site west of Basra the mass grave where Jawad Ali's son was buried? He wanted to believe it. Across Basra, people are swapping rumors and frantically looking for evidence. What are the coalition forces doing, not only to assuage these tortured souls but to ensure for very practical reasons that justice is done and the vengeances of past atrocities are finally laid to rest? No one's interests are served when individuals disturb mass graves. People rarely find what they're looking for, and they often spoil the chances of everyone else to find what they need. American and British forces must, as an urgent priority, begin guarding sites such as the one we visited west of Basra to prevent spontaneous digging by bereaved relatives. These are crime scenes, and the coalition forces, as occupying powers, must function as the police in Iraq right now. Mass graves will provide crucial evidence for tribunals the U.S. government has said should be established to prosecute the crimes. At the same time, most victims' families seem far more concerned with the emotional need to know than with the abstract need for justice. They must have a voice in devising a recovery and documentation plan. International forces cannot simply keep people away from sites they desperately want to visit; the American and British authorities should work with local leaders to establish a missing-persons agency where families can come with things like the dental records of the vanished. For a host of legal reasons, as well as emotional ones, families will need official confirmation of the death and cause of death of their loved ones. The site we visited with Ali was literally explosive. But the crimes of the past can still explode in many other ways.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch called on President Olusegun Obasanjo and other leaders of the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to restrain their party members and supporters from committing further acts of violence, and urged opposition leaders to ensure their supporters do not react violently to the elections.  “President Obasanjo must commit his government to upholding the rule of law,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. “The Nigerian government has consistently failed to stamp out impunity for political violence, which then set the stage for the current electoral violence.”  Takirambudde added that as a leader in the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD), President Obasanjo has a responsibility not only to the Nigerian people but also to people across Africa to set an example of good governance.  According to official results, the PDP won a significant majority in both the presidential and gubernatorial elections of April 19 and the National Assembly polls of April 12. However, the elections have been marked by serious incidents of violence, and widespread vote rigging and fraud. The violence has included clashes between supporters of the PDP and the largest opposition party, the All Nigeria People’s Party (ANPP). The ANPP and other parties have rejected the official results at various levels.  Some of the worst violence and intimidation during the election period occurred in the oil-rich Niger Delta, in Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers states, where PDP incumbents have been announced victorious in the governorship races.  Human Rights Watch called on the Nigerian government to investigate all reported cases of electoral violence, as well as the many incidents of political violence in the months and weeks leading up to the elections.  “Nigerian officials should ensure that those responsible for the electoral violence are brought to justice. This includes members of the ruling party who may have organized or participated in killings,” said Takirambudde.  In a report published just before the elections, “Testing Democracy: Political Violence in Nigeria,” Human Rights Watch documented an alarming rise in political violence and highlighted the lack of accountability for perpetrators.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Rights Body In Serious Decline","","04/25/2003","(Geneva) - This year's session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has proved even more disappointing than last year, Human Rights Watch said on the last day of the six-week meeting in Geneva.     An """"abusers club"""" of governments hostile to human rights has further consolidated its position and blocked several important country initiatives, while the United States and to a lesser extent, the European Union have not exerted positive leadership.     """"The commission appears to be in a really serious decline,"""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch. """"Governments this year were even less outspoken in criticizing the worst human rights violators worldwide.""""     Human Rights Watch criticized the United States, which rejoined the commission this year, for playing a destructive role on many issues. The European Union also failed to take firm and principled stand on many important votes. In a sudden about-face, the United States for the first time refrained from cosponsoring a resolution condemning Russia's abuses in Chechnya (the resolution was defeated by 21 votes against, to 15 votes in favor, with 17 abstentions). The United States also abandoned its traditional practice of sponsoring a resolution critical of China, citing leadership changes and unspecified human rights improvements.     The United States blocked any focused debate on the situation in Iraq and resisted human rights monitoring of Iraq's transition. It strongly opposed any call for accountability for past human rights abuses in Afghanistan, and criticism of continuing human rights problems in that country. The United States also fought unsuccessfully to prevent the commission from calling on governments to ratify the statute for the International Criminal Court.     Despite the overwhelming international consensus against the execution of juvenile offenders, the United States insisted that this principle be dropped from a resolution on children's rights. In 2002, the world's only known executions of juvenile offenders were carried out by the U.S. state of Texas, and the United States is the only country worldwide that continues to execute people who were under eighteen at the time of the offense.     However, this year's death penalty resolution condemns the practice more forcefully and makes clear that the execution of juveniles is absolutely prohibited by international human rights law.     The European Union, evidently preoccupied with its own internal divisions and relations with Washington, failed to stand firm and united on critical issues. Although the European Union was nearly the only sponsor of country resolutions, it often was not forceful enough. Resolutions on Russia, Zimbabwe and Sudan were all less critical than in previous years and ultimately were defeated. The European Union refrained from tabling a resolution critical of Iran, pointing to its newly established but unproven human rights dialogue with Tehran. It also did not introduce a resolution on China.     """"The United States and European Union have complained loudly about the abusive governments that are members of the commission,"""" Weschler said. """"But on many issues they have been just as ready to subjugate human rights to their political interests.""""     A powerful grouping of hostile governments who have joined the commission in recent years, including Algeria, Libya, Sudan, Syria and Zimbabwe, joined with China, Cuba and Russia to oppose several important country initiatives. African governments, led by South Africa, worked as a bloc to oppose scrutiny of the human rights situation in Zimbabwe and Sudan.     Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Norway, New Zealand and Switzerland were among the few to hold a firm and principled line on many key human rights issues. Other Latin American and Caribbean countries who might be expected to champion human rights, such as Brazil and Argentina, failed to back important resolutions, and proved muted in their criticism of Cuba.     Some of the commission's significant achievements included first-time initiatives by the EU on North Korea, by the United States on Belarus and jointly by the EU and the United States on Turkmenistan.     """"When the U.S. and the E.U. have the political resolve to censure human rights violators, they can make a powerful statement,"""" Weschler said. """"The problem is that they don't do it often enough.""""     In another positive development, a working group was established to elaborate an Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that would allow for individual complaints. The commission will also consider a resolution on the need to uphold human rights while countering terrorism, although it failed to establish a dedicated monitoring mechanism.     """"The upcoming elections for next year's session will make or break the commission,"""" Weschler warned. """"Several countries with terrible human rights records - such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Saudi Arabia - are in the running.""""     Elections for commission membership will be held next week in New York. Human Rights Watch has argued that, as a prerequisite for membership of the commission, governments should have ratified core human rights treaties, complied with their reporting obligations, issued open invitations to U.N. human rights experts and not have been condemned recently by the commission for human rights violations.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, Cuba, Mexico, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, North Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Global","International Justice, United Nations, International Criminal Court"

The U.S. Army has used ground-based Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and other artillery-launched cluster munitions in populated areas of Baghdad and other Iraqi cities, Human Rights Watch said.  U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Staff Gen. Richard B. Myers told a press conference today in Washington that coalition forces dropped """"nearly 1,500 cluster bombs of varying types"""" during the war in Iraq, and that only 26 of those fell within 1,500 feet of civilian neighborhoods, causing only """"one recorded case of collateral damage.""""  But Myers did not mention surface-launched cluster munitions, which are believed to have caused many more civilian casualties.  """"To imply that cluster munitions caused virtually no harm to Iraqi civilians is highly disingenuous,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of whitewashing the facts, the Pentagon needs to come clean about the Army's use of cluster munitions, which has been much more fatal to civilians.""""  Numerous media reports have provided eyewitness accounts of cluster munitions use against populated areas in the southern part of Baghdad. Newsday reported on April 15 that two children were killed, and one seriously injured, when a cluster munition they were playing with exploded.  According to media reports, cluster munitions have also caused injuries to U.S. troops. The Associated Press reported on April 23 that a U.S. army sergeant was killed in a cluster bomb explosion, and on April 19 that several U.S. service members were injured when a child handed an M-42 submunition to them and it blew up.  In the press conference, Gen. Myers also described cluster munitions as """"precision guided.""""  In fact, the wide dispersal pattern of cluster munitions makes them difficult to target accurately. Moreover, because of their high failure rate, cluster munitions leave large numbers of hazardous, explosive duds that may cause injury or death to civilians long after the war is over. """"Cluster munitions are not precision weapons,"""" said Roth. """"They are, in fact, indiscriminate weapons - which is why the U.S. military should never use them near populated areas.""""  Clearing populated areas of unexploded cluster munitions will require full disclosure of when and where the weapons were used.

The United Nations and the United States should pressure Bangkok to end its shoot-to-kill policy. Deviating sharply from Thailand's previous efforts to build the rule of law, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has called for law enforcement to be conducted on the basis of an """"eye for an eye."""" Interior Minister Wan Muhamad Nor Matha put it bluntly in January. Referring to drug dealers, he said: """"They will be put behind bars or even vanish without a trace. Who cares? They are destroying our country."""" Since the crackdown started Feb. 1, Thai police report that more than 2,270 alleged drug criminals have been killed. The government says 51 have been killed by police in self-defense and the rest in battles among dealers. More than 50,000 people allegedly involved in the drug trade have been arrested. The use of dangerous drugs is certainly a serious and growing problem in Thailand. UN and Thai authorities cite a huge increase in use in methamphetamine stimulant tablets - which Thais call """"yaa baa,"""" or crazy pills - smuggled in from neighboring Burma. As many as 3.6 percent of Thai youth and 5 percent of all Thais now take methamphetamines. Many in Thailand, including the revered constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, are worried by this trend and have called on the government to take action. But Thai authorities should do so in ways that do not compromise basic rights. This is hardly the message being sent by Thai leaders. """"In this war, drug dealers must die,"""" Thaksin has said. """"But we don't kill them. It's a matter of bad guys killing bad guys."""" Few in Thailand find his explanation credible. At the behest of Thaksin's government, local authorities hurriedly drew up blacklists of suspected drug dealers. Bangkok then gave provincial governors and police chiefs short deadlines to clear names from the list. The interior minister threatened retaliation against local officials who did not produce results, driving home the point by citing the way a former king dealt with unresponsive officials: """"The king had them all beheaded."""" Local officials appear to be using the blacklists to settle old scores. Once on the list, the only way off, according to one rights activist, is to """"buy your way off the list, surrender at a police station or end up with a bullet in your head."""" But even surrendering to the police offers no certainty. Some who have come to the police to surrender or clear their names have been shot by unidentified gunmen on the way home. Human rights activists accuse the government of unleashing a """"shoot to kill"""" policy. While Thaksin campaigned for political office as a modernizer, his tactics represent a major step back to the dark days of military rule in Thailand. Pradit Chareonthaitawee, the head of Thailand's official human rights commission, received death threats after saying, """"People are living in fear all over the kingdom."""" Drug experts and the United Nations suggest that instead of setting a futile goal of ending all drug sales in three months, Thailand should concentrate on """"supply reduction strategies."""" One such strategy would be to focus on its own military and police, many of whose members allegedly profit greatly from facilitating the smuggling chain from Burma. The shoot-to-kill policy must end. Persons accused of crimes should be arrested with the least force necessary, as called for in the UN Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials. All recent killings should be investigated by an independent commission. To ensure credibility, Asma Jahangir, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, should be invited to investigate. The United States provides anti-narcotics training to the Thai police and the United Nations has the regional headquarters of its drugs and crime office in Bangkok. Each risks having its reputation sullied by association with a bloody and violent campaign in the name of the war on drugs. Both the United States and the UN should make it clear that they oppose the methods being used in this war. If the violence doesn't stop, each should consider withdrawing from Thailand.

Five remain in custody but have not been brought before judicial authorities or allowed to see lawyers or family, in violation of Egyptian and international law.  An eighth activist, Ashraf Ibrahim, a member of the Popular Committee in Support of the Palestinian Intifada, has been missing since Saturday, April 19. Several days earlier, SSI officers raided his home in his absence and confiscated his computer, video camera and other documents.  “The SSI has a pretty bad record for mistreating political prisoners, but these reports of torture are especially disturbing,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The government should investigate and punish those responsible without delay.”  Stork also called on the authorities to release immediately those still in custody.  Egyptian security forces apprehended students Amr Muhammad Abd al-Atif, Mahmoud Hassan Hassan, and Walid Abd al-Razaq Fuad at midday on Saturday, April 12, as they were about to attend a demonstration at the Press Syndicate in Cairo. That night, the authorities picked up student Ramiz Gihad from a café in the Bab al-Luq neighborhood. On Sunday, April 13, journalist Wael Tawfiq disappeared and was later seen in custody at SSI headquarters. Ibrahim al-Sahari, a journalist for the Egyptian daily Al-`Alam al-Yom, and activist Marwan Hamdi were taken from their homes in the early hours of April 14 and taken to an unknown location.  Two of the students, Amr Abd al-Atif and Walid Fuad, were released on April 15. One told Human Rights Watch that he and the others held at SSI headquarters had been beaten at the time of arrest and during interrogation sessions. Describing his beating during interrogation, he said, “One of them was holding my arm behind my back so I couldn’t protect myself. One hit me in the groin and testicles, one hit me in the stomach, one on my chest, and one around the thighs.” The Cairo-based Nadeem Center for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence examined this student and “confirmed testicular congestion, contusions and bruises in the back muscles and the muscles on the front of the left thigh.”  This student also described how Cairo University law student Ramiz Gihad, age 25, was taken out of their cell several times a day:  """"He stayed a long time upstairs, up to four hours at a time. He was tortured by electricity as well as beatings. He told us—he didn’t even have to tell us, though, you could tell by his condition. We saw the burn marks from the electrocution. He was nearly comatose when they carried him in [the cell]. His face was extremely swollen and bruised. He was shaking. There were burn marks on his hand and elbows, and the feet and toes. He had dry mouth and the police carrying him in ordered us not to give him any water.""""  Four of those still in custody are believed to still be held in SSI headquarters, and al-Sahari is believed to be in Mazra` Tora prison. The authorities have not charged them with any offense or issued administrative detention orders, in violation of Egyptian law and international standards, and have not permitted lawyers or family members to visit or speak with them.  Al-Sahari had been detained without charge for several weeks and beaten in February 2003. His wife, Hala Dahrough, told Human Rights Watch that during the most recent arrest, SSI officers complained that al-Sahari “has a long tongue” and “talks too much about [President Hosni] Mubarak,” and that they thought he would have “learned a lesson” from his February detention.  In late March, the Egyptian authorities arrested an estimated 800 persons in connection with antiwar demonstrations that also included slogans criticizing Egyptian government policies and President Mubarak. Human Rights Watch interviewed numerous persons detained at that time who also said they had been beaten while being apprehended and in police custody.  “President Mubarak and other high Egyptian officials constantly proclaim that Egypt is a democracy and committed to the rule of law,” Stork said. “But what we see instead is an epidemic of state security violence and arbitrary detention in response to people protesting officials and their policies.”","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

In a letter sent today to U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch urged the United States to strictly observe international children's rights standards regarding the detainees.  """"Secretary Rumsfeld called those detained at Guantanamo the 'worst of the worst,'"""" said Jo Becker, child rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"It's hard to believe that a 13 year old could fit that category.""""  A Pentagon spokesperson has said that the children are being questioned to obtain possible intelligence.  """"Simply providing the United States with military intelligence does not justify the detention of children,"""" said Becker. """"If these children have committed offenses, they should be provided with counsel and adjudicated in accordance with standards of juvenile justice. Otherwise, they should be released immediately.""""  The conditions at Guantanamo pose particularly serious risks to children. Child detainees should never be held together with adults, but because there are so few children, they are held for long periods in virtual isolation. They have no access to lawyers, limited or no access to their families, and are subject to interrogation.  Human Rights Watch raised a particular concern that isolated conditions are especially conducive to suicidal behavior. Studies have shown that children held in adult jails, where they are more likely to be held in separate, secure housing and spend substantial periods of time in isolation, are up to eight times more likely to commit suicide than those held in facilities specifically for juveniles.  """"There have already been as many as 25 suicide attempts reported at Guantanamo,"""" said Becker. """"Children at Guantanamo are at even higher risk, particularly because of their relative isolation.""""  Human Rights Watch noted that the children held at Guantanamo may have participated in armed conflict in Afghanistan as child soldiers with the Taliban or Al-Qaeda.  Under international humanitarian law, under no circumstances should children under the age of 15 be recruited or used to participate in hostilities. A treaty ratified by the United States in December 2002 establishes a higher age of 18 as the minimum age for any compulsory recruitment or participation in armed conflict. It also obliges governments to assist in the demobilization and rehabilitation of former child soldiers.  """"The use of children as soldiers is an appalling abuse,"""" said Becker.

A group of more than 1,000 Iranian Kurd, Palestinian, Sudanese, Somali and Syrian refugees have faced threats and attacks during the past week, according to reports collected by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Despite repeated pleas by UNHCR to admit all 1000 refugees who fled to the border, Jordan has so far only allowed 150 refugees entry.  """"Most of these refugees fled to Iraq from persecution in their home countries years ago,"""" said Alison Parker, a refugee protection expert at Human Rights Watch. """"Now they are facing new threats in a country that was once a relatively safe haven.""""  Of particular concern are the more than 400 refugee children at risk because of difficult humanitarian conditions in the border region. Human Rights Watch said the children and their families should be allowed to enter the refugee camps in Jordan without delay so that medical relief can be provided.  The refugees told UNHCR that groups of armed Iraqis forced them from their homes and threatened that, if they refused to leave Iraq, the men would be killed and the women raped. Others said that they fled because of the lack of food and water in the places where they normally reside, including the Bijii and Balediyat neighborhoods in Baghdad, and the al-Hurriya and al-Tash refugee camps outside of Baghdad.  Human Rights Watch said that the United States and allied forces, as occupying powers, must ensure security for the local population under their control and authority, including refugees residing in the country. This includes:  Preventing third parties from attacking or forcibly displacing civilians, especially particularly vulnerable groups such as the 128,000 refugees living in Iraq. All women, including refugees, should be protected against any attack, in particular rape. Child refugees must also be afforded appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance. All civilians inside Iraq must be treated with the same consideration by the occupying powers without any adverse distinction based, in particular, on national origin, race, religion or political opinion. Finally, the occupying powers must ensure that humanitarian assistance reaches refugees.UNHCR's Executive Committee has stated that governments should always admit asylum seekers at least on a temporary basis and provide them with protection without any discrimination.  """"Jordan should allow these refugees to enter, at least on a temporary basis,"""" said Parker. """"When conditions of lawlessness put refugees at grave risk in Iraq, where else can they turn for safety but neighboring countries?""""  Jordan has cited concerns that some of the refugees pose security problems.

A nineteen-page briefing paper published by Human Rights Watch details recent events in the Central Highlands through March 2003 and provides English translations of previously unavailable documents, including several hand-written Montagnard testimonies on the crackdown, and two internal Vietnamese government directives.  """"Despite Hanoi's statements of concern for its ethnic minorities, Vietnam is clearly escalating its repression of the Montagnards,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The United Nations and Vietnam's international donors must take a more active role in protesting and preventing such serious human rights violations.""""  Nine letters written by Montagnard church leaders in Dak Lak province detail ongoing human rights violations up to the end of February 2003. They describe beatings of church leaders by police and other officials, destruction of churches, official prohibitions on nighttime gatherings and travel outside of villages, and widespread confiscation of villagers' farm land by authorities. Human Rights Watch has obtained original copies of official Vietnamese government documents issued in February 2003, describing ceremonies in which Montagnard villagers are forced to """"Swear Brotherhood"""" (le ket nghia) with local party cadres in front of pictures of Ho Chi Minh. Local officials are instructed to coordinate with party officials to """"step by step, eradicate out-dated and backward ways, and eradicate all illegal religious organizations.""""  To enforce the new directives, in February 2003 the Vietnamese government launched a fresh round of arrests of Montagnard Christians as well as those suspected by the government of seeking to flee to Cambodia or of supporting the Montagnard movement for greater land rights. Widespread peaceful demonstrations took place in the Central Highlands in February 2001.  Other documents obtained by Human Rights Watch show how government officials are forcing Montagnards to sign """"voluntary"""" papers pledging to withdraw petitions opposing government confiscation of their land.  In March, Human Rights Watch received a handwritten list containing the names and thumbprints of 439 ethnic Montagnard Christian families (1,206 people) from Dak Lak province, Vietnam, who are requesting international protection in Cambodia. """"Please have pity for us and rescue the Christian believers and help us receive back our ancestral lands,"""" one of the petitions states. """"Only those who have been persecuted have agreed to give their fingerprints below.""""  Hundreds of Montagnards have gone into hiding in Vietnam, unable to obtain asylum in Cambodia. On March 26, Vietnamese security police and soldiers shot at a group of Montagnards who had gone into hiding in the forest in Gia Lai province. Five people escaped, but two men were wounded and taken to the commune center, where one of the men later died. When his body was returned to his family, his skull had been severely crushed, apparently from additional beatings by security officers at the commune center. The whereabouts of the other man taken into custody are unknown. A third Montagnard was arrested and beaten on March 27, but then allowed to return to his village.  Since the beginning of 2003, more than 100 Montagnards who have tried to flee to Cambodia have been forcibly returned to Vietnam, where some have been arrested and beaten. More than seventy Montagnards are currently serving lengthy prison sentences in Vietnam for participating in protests or trying to flee to Cambodia since February 2001.  The Cambodian government, which last year sealed its borders to new refugee arrivals, announced this month that it plans to close the refugee transit center operated by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Phnom Penh as soon as the final forty-two refugees are resettled.  """"UNHCR's ability to protect and screen new refugees will be severely compromised if it is forced to close its refugee camps in Cambodia,"""" said Adams.  Human Rights Watch called on Vietnam's international donors to insist that Vietnam cease its persecution against the Montagnards. Human Rights Watch also called on the Cambodian government to authorize UNHCR to immediately establish a field presence in Cambodia's border provinces, to re-open provincial refugee camps that were closed last year, and to provide protection and assistance to refugees from Vietnam.","Asia, Vietnam","Religious Freedom, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/04/20/colombia-talks-paramilitary-groups","Colombia- Talks with paramilitary groups","Colombia: Talks with paramilitary groups","","04/20/2003","The Colombian government is undertaking talks with the country's largest illegal paramilitary group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, aimed at demobilization. Human Rights Watch supports efforts to demobilize fighters and work towards ending Colombia's conflict by peaceful means as long as fundamental principles of justice and accountability for crimes against humanity, human rights violations, and war crimes are respected and illegal armed groups are demobilized in fact as well as on paper. As a matter of principle, Human Rights Watch does not oppose amnesties or pardons for the crimes of rebellion, sedition, or crimes against the state, since the state has the right to forgive crimes against itself. Amnesties of this kind are favored by the standards adopted by nations to govern conflicts and their resolution. Indeed, Colombia's constitution allows amnesties for what are defined as """"political crimes.""""  Human Rights Watch does oppose amnesties or pardons for those responsible for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious human rights violations. These are crimes against individuals which the state has no right to forgive. These crimes merit condemnation regardless of borders or internal politics. A growing body of treaties and international laws prohibit states from granting amnesties for these violations. Colombian jurisprudence also prevents its leaders from awarding blanket amnesties absent a judicial process.  There are also powerful practical arguments against blanket amnesties. Their contribution to peace is illusory. By eroding the rule of law, they encourage further violence. In Colombia, the history on this issue is stark. Past amnesties have yielded a worsening of the conflict, a growing death toll made up primarily of civilians, and increasingly barbarous tactics used by the armed groups active throughout the country.  Ensuring that any negotiation include justice for human rights crimes is critical given the future of Colombia's conflict. Any agreement with paramilitaries will be seen as a model for future negotiations with the guerrillas. If a blanket amnesty is awarded to the paramilitaries who planned or ordered atrocities, guerrillas have all the more reason to demand impunity for their past and future crimes, believing that they can commit them and simply, at a later date, insist that these crimes be pardoned.  Impunity for human rights criminals cannot be the price of demobilization. As U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell noted during his December 2002 visit to Colombia, the leaders and field commanders of the AUC """"have much to account for, not only under U.S. law but under Colombian law as well.""""  Background  Carlos Castaño, a rancher, convicted murderer, and indicted drug trafficker, currently leads a large paramilitary group initially formed in the 1980s by his brother, Fidel. At that time, Fidel Castaño and his Tangüeros were linked to dozens of massacres and targeted killings in northern Colombia. Nevertheless, they negotiated a demobilization in 1991, turning in 600 guns and agreeing to stop attacks. At the time, the government had multiple arrest warrants for Fidel and his fighters in relation to serious human rights violations. However, the government never seriously pursued Fidel or his henchmen, resulting in a de facto amnesty. Both before and after the demobilization, the Colombian security forces and regional leaders maintained a close alliance with the Castaños, including helping them plan and carry out massacres and targeted killings. That alliance and the de facto amnesty resulted in effective impunity for serious human rights crimes.  Only three years after the Tangüeros demobilized, Carlos Castaño reorganized the group and renamed it the Peasant Self-Defense Group of Córdoba and Urabá (Autodefensas Unidas de Córdoba y Urabá, ACCU). In 1997, Castaño allied with other paramilitaries to launch the AUC. Currently, he claims to command at least 11,000 armed, uniformed, and trained fighters. The AUC funds its activities through drug trafficking, taxes on illegal drug production, extortion, and some voluntary contributions.  Paramilitaries are the leading violators of human rights in Colombia and have been indicted for massacres (defined in Colombia as the killing of three or more people at the same place and time), selective killings, enforced disappearances, torture, death threats, and forced displacement. Paramilitary forces continue to operate with the tolerance and often support of units within Colombia's military.  Human Rights Watch receives numerous and credible reports of joint military-paramilitary operations and the sharing of intelligence and propaganda. Throughout Colombia, paramilitaries continue to move uniformed and heavily armed troops unhindered past military installations. Mayors, municipal officials, governors, human rights groups, the public advocate's office, and even some police detachments regularly informed the appropriate authorities about credible threats by paramilitaries. Yet only rarely do military forces take effective action to stop paramilitary advances.  As of this writing, for example, the attorney general's office has thirty-nine outstanding arrest warrants against Carlos Castaño (Fidel is presumed dead). In addition, Colombian courts have returned guilty verdicts against Carlos in absentia in three cases, including the murder of presidential candidate Bernardo Jaramillo in 1990. In 2002, the United States indicted Castaño and fellow paramilitary leaders Hernán Giraldo and Salvatore Mancuso on drug trafficking charges. The AUC is also on the U.S. State Department list of foreign terrorist organizations. Many more paramilitary commanders are the subject of arrest warrants, indictments, and guilty verdicts for massacres, targeted killings, torture, death threats, and forced displacement.  A surprise announcement In November 2002, the Colombian government confirmed that it was considering negotiations with paramilitaries. On November 29, Carlos Castaño released a letter announcing a unilateral cease fire as a gesture meant to encourage talks. Although Castaño does not represent all paramilitaries, he is an influential figure and represents thousands of fighters.  The talks present novel issues. In contrast to guerrillas, paramilitaries always defined themselves as a pro-government force even as they targeted and killed civilians, political leaders, elected officials, prosecutors, and police. Particularly delicate is the degree to which these talks will implicate active duty and high-ranking military officers who have worked with paramilitaries, helped them commit atrocities, or tolerated their activities. In addition, paramilitary leaders have also been linked to drug trafficking, and several, including Castaño, have pending extradition orders from the United States.  On January 20, the government announced that formal talks with Castaño had begun. Currently, three groups are negotiating: the ACCU, active in northwestern Colombia; the Bloque Central Bolívar and Vencedores de Arauca, active in central Colombia and the department of Arauca; and the Grupo de Alianza del Oriente, from the eastern plains. However, the most active groups, including one on Colombia's north coast, one based in the city of Medellín,and one in the eastern state of Casanare have announced that they will not take part in talks.  To facilitate talks, the government issued Decree 128, which establishes rules based on a previous law, Law 418, that authorizes the authorities to award incentives to armed groups that agree to demobilize. Incentives can include a reduction of prison sentences, financial support, and assistance to reintegrate into civilian life. However, Decree 128 stipulates that the government cannot issue incentives to individuals """"who are being prosecuted or who have been found guilty of crimes"""" established in Colombian law or ratified treaties. This is a crucial point since it requires that individuals under investigation for serious human rights abuses be held accountable for their crimes.  In addition, Colombia is a signatory to the Rome Treaty and therefore has, in principle, accepted that the International Criminal Court (ICC) has jurisdiction over crimes against humanity that are not prosecuted effectively in Colombia. The treaty requires that Colombia cooperate with the ICC should the national justice system prove unwilling to or incapable of prosecuting crimes against humanity.  Nevertheless, in a January 12 interview with the Colombian daily El Tiempo, Justice/Interior Minister Fernando Londoño seemed to ignore these critical safeguards. In answer to a question about possible impunity for paramilitaries engaged in talks, he said, """"Every [peace] process presumes this."""" Human Rights Watch remains concerned that, despite clear legal barriers against impunity, political decisions will be made that will lead to broad pardons being issued to infamous criminals. Far from promoting an end to the conflict, such measures only promise that it will continue to worsen albeit in the hands of repackaged or renamed combatants.  Standards  The following standards must be observed in designing a framework for talks:  1. Accountability  Regardless of whether or not there are talks, the Colombian government must break persistent links between the military and paramilitary groups. This means aggressively removing from the security forces and prosecuting through the civilian justice system officers and soldiers found to have collaborated with these illegal groups. Failing to dismantle the military-paramilitary alliance will only lead to new illegal roups forming with military complicity; The Colombian government must require that leaders and field commanders against whom there are arrest warrants, indictments, or credible evidence of serious human rights abuses, including massacres, selective killings, torture, and forced disappearance, stand trial either in Colombia, in another country, or before the ICC. Their surrender must be a part of any deal; Law 418 and its rules, incorporated in Decree 128, should be applied only to facilitate talks, but should not be used as a stepping stone to impunity for individuals who have committed serious human rights crimes. The suspension of arrest warrants should be strictly limited to the negotiating period; It is critical that Colombia place the highest priority on the pursuit of the people who organized or ordered serious human rights violations. If leaders and field commanders who have committed crimes against humanity or human rights violations fail to surrender once negotiations are concluded, they should be pursued aggressively and arrested in order to stand trial; Those paramilitaries who refuse to take part in negotiations or who leave the table should be pursued even as talks are on-going; The Colombian government must ensure that the Attorney General's office is operating in a fair and efficient manner in assembling a body of evidence to prosecute paramilitaries responsible for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and serious human rights violations, including leaders, field commanders, and the military officers who work with them; Given the long-standing ties between Colombia's security forces and paramilitary groups, it is critical that investigations of paramilitary crimes also, where relevant, identify the state agents who took part in or facilitated crimes. These ties should be thoroughly investigated and those responsible prosecuted and punished; Lower-ranking paramilitaries may be offered reduced sentences or other judicial benefits if they did not take direct part in ordering or carrying out serious human rights crimes and based on their cooperation with the authorities. At the time of sentencing, the fact that a fighter was under orders or cooperated with the authorities in clarifying crimes may constitute a mitigating circumstance. Cooperation must be truthful and complete in order to qualify any paramilitary fighter for any reduced sentence; In all cases, no benefits should be granted before the judicial process is complete and individual responsibilities are established; Colombia should establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to hear cases involving alleged paramilitary crimes. This Commission should not be a substitute for justice, but rather part of a mechanism designed to promote accountability and a full accounting of serious human rights crimes; The victims of paramilitary crimes should receive reparations, ideally from a government fund collected for that purpose; The granting of judicial benefits to paramilitary fighters should not preclude the government from paying reparations for their crimes. 2. Demobilization  So long as paramilitaries remain armed, mobile, and able to mount offensive actions, Colombia should continue to take effective military actions against them and their leadership. The Colombian government should not enter into a cease fire with any paramilitary organization unless it ceases all offensive military operations, including abuses against civilians, and takes carefully monitored steps toward demobilization; An effective concentration of AUC forces in a defined area apart from the civilian population and with full security guarantees should be a precondition for any deal. This means that forces should be concentrated, disarmed, and provided with full protection and support by the government. This should be at a place where there is no permanent population, and the rights of residents in neighboring areas should be protected fully by the government. The AUC should not be granted de facto government power over people or territory, as was done in the past with the so-called zona de despeje granted to the FARC-EP; The demobilization should be supervised by the Catholic Church and an international body capable of supporting a full team in Colombia for the prolonged period necessary to ensure the process. This group should have the power to investigate and sanction non-compliance and should ensure that the Colombian people and the international community are well informed about the process; Special programs should be developed to assist children who fight alongside paramilitaries. These programs should include, as essential elements, protection, counseling, and educational programs designed to equip them to re-enter civilian life. UNICEF is one of the organizations that should be brought in to assist with the rehabilitation of former child soldiers; Special programs should be developed to support the return of families forcibly displaced by paramilitary violence. These programs should include, as essential elements, protection, counseling, health, education, and agricultural assistance. In some cases, the government will have to reallocate lands seized by paramilitaries and ensure that all families displaced by violence are able to support themselves; The Uribe administration plans to recruit peasant soldiers to deploy in rural areas. Recruits must also be carefully screened and supervised, to ensure that individuals against whom there is credible evidence of human rights abuses are not absorbed into state forces; The Colombian government must ensure security and accountability in areas formerly under paramilitary control, to prevent other illegal forces from simply taking their place. This means that these areas must receive priority assignments of permanent units of the security forces along with the effective provision of civilian resources through the Health, Education, Transportation, Commerce and Interior Ministries along with representatives of social service and humanitarian aid organizations able to begin programs aimed at reasserting state control and development; 3. The United States  The United States must aggressively apply the human rights conditions attached to military aid to Colombia, to ensure that links between the security forces and paramilitaries are broken as a condition of continuing to receive military assistance; The United States must press Colombia and its military to pursue the paramilitaries who are not part of the negotiation, to demonstrate that demobilization, not continued fighting, is their best hope; Even as negotiations take place, the United States must continue to collect intelligence on paramilitary leaders and field commanders, so that if these individuals fail to surrender at the appropriate time, they can be pursued, captured, and brought to justice; U.S. extradition requests for paramilitary leaders linked to drug trafficking have played an important role in forcing these individuals to the negotiation table. These requests should not be withdrawn; The United States should financially support efforts of Colombia's Attorney General's office to investigate and prosecute individuals accused of serious human rights crimes; The United States should financially support demobilization efforts, particularly with programs aimed at ensuring the rule of law in regions formerly under paramilitary control, rehabilitating child soldiers, and resettling families forcibly displaced by the conflict. 4. International Community  The international community should make it clear that it opposes impunity for crimes against humanity, war crimes, and gross violations of human rights; Irrespective of decisions made by the Colombian government, the international community should ensure that the perpetrators of crimes against humanity do not escape prosecution. An ICC investigation may be appropriate for crimes committed after November 1, 2002; other states should consider whether their court can prosecute crimes committed prior to that date; The international community should financially support some of the cost of the negotiation, prosecutions, and demobilization. This would include the cost of prosecuting human rights abusers, reintegrating former paramilitaries and their families and supporters into society, returning forcibly displaced families to their homes, rehabilitating former child soldiers, and providing for the return of effective government authority to areas formerly under paramilitary control. These are likely to be costly, long-term commitments; however, the risks of failing to fully fund them are many more years of a sharply worsening conflict.","Americas, Colombia",""

Bush called on the United Nations to lift economic sanctions against Iraq. But this would effectively remove U.N. oversight of Iraq's oil revenues through the Oil-for-Food program before a new and transparent regime is in place.  In a new backgrounder, Human Rights Watch outlines principles for the management of Iraq's oil revenues that would ensure transparency and accountability in order to avoid the long-term problems of corruption, poor governance, and human rights violations that plague many undemocratic, oil-dependent countries.  """"Iraq's oil belongs to the Iraqi people. An independent mechanism must be kept in place to ensure oil revenues are managed transparently and to meet their humanitarian needs,"""" said Arvind Ganesan, director of the Business and Human Rights Program.  Human Rights Watch said oil revenues should be directed first to meeting the humanitarian needs of Iraq's people. Prior to the war, approximately 60 percent of Iraqi families received their sole sustenance from the Oil-for-Food program. Because of the conflict and the initial suspension of the Oil-for-Food program, humanitarian needs will increase substantially.  Human Rights Watch said another pressing issue was who should manage the oil. Any reversion to foreign control, or the appearance of foreign control, in the aftermath of U.S.-led military intervention will likely be a major issue of contention and popular opposition.  """"There is an inherent conflict-of-interest if the world's largest oil importer is seen to be managing the world's second largest oil reserves,"""" said Ganesan. """"The only way to deal with that is to allow functioning Iraqi institutions, or an independent mechanism with Iraqi participation, to manage the oil resources for the good of the Iraqi people.""""  It is not clear whether the Iraq National Oil Company, which has managed the Iraqi oil sector, is now capable of functioning effectively in this role. To ensure transparency and independence, Human Rights Watch recommended that a third party be given this role, for instance the United Nations Office of Iraq Policy.  Regardless of the institution managing Iraq's oil, Human Rights Watch said that all sources of oil revenue and expenditures should be audited and those results made public. The designated institution should also have the authority to tender and manage an open bidding process for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Iraqi oil infrastructure. In the case of new exploration and production agreements, the entity responsible for the open tendering and bidding process should ensure that the contracts that it awards are comparable to similar agreements throughout the world and should be made public. The companies that receive such contracts should publish all payments made to the authority managing Iraq's oil as a result of their contractual or other agreements in order for the Iraqi public to be aware of these arrangements.  """"Post-war Iraq should be a model for other oil-dependent states,"""" said Ganesan. """"Careful management of Iraq's oil resources would allow for strengthening institutions that protect human rights and would show that it is possible to benefit from oil wealth without sacrificing human rights and democratic freedoms or fueling massive corruption.  Background  Iraq has more than 112 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, the second largest in the world. However, its oil infrastructure is underdeveloped or deteriorating and will require considerable investment to realize its full potential as the economic engine of a post-war economy and a democratic government that respects human rights.  The cornerstone of Iraq's post-Gulf War oil revenue management has been the U.N.-administered Oil-for-Food Program that was established by the Security Council in 1995. Although Iraq has the second largest proven oil reserves in the world, its actual production is currently far below its potential.  The U.N. Security Council modified and extended the mandate of the Oil-for-Food program for forty-five days on March 28, 2003, but it is not clear whether the mandate will be renewed, for what period of time, or what will be the scope of the program's mandate.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","Economic Justice and Rights, Oil, Mining, and Natural Resources"

Human Rights Watch also called for outside access to other detainees in military custody who might be at serious risk of ill-treatment. """"This death in military custody will only increase the local climate of fear and intimidation,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """" It could not have happened at a worse time, when Jakarta says it wants to relieve tensions in Papua."""" The death of Yapenas on April 15, 2003 was reported by local human rights groups. At least twenty other people are in detention at the Jayawijaya Military District Command (KODIM 1702) in Wamena, Papua.  A local human rights group reported that Yapenas and another man, Kanius Murib, were arrested by the military on April 6, 2003. They were reportedly dragged for three kilometers from Wamena town to Ilekma sub-village in Sinakma on April 14. Yapenas had two ropes tied around his neck, which were deliberately pulled in different directions by soldiers throughout the journey, causing him to fall several times; Kanius was handcuffed. Yapenas was last seen alive on the evening of April 14, 2003 and is believed to have died soon after while in the Wamena KODIM (district military command office). A Papuan newspaper, Harian Cenderawasih Pos, reported that the doctor who performed an official autopsy concluded that Yapenas had died because of """"obstruction to his upper respiratory tract."""" The newspaper also reported that family members signed a letter agreeing not to hold the military responsible for the death, before they were allowed to take the body away. Another detainee from the Wamena KODIM is also believed to be in Wamena General Hospital receiving treatment for knife wounds and other injuries, believed to have been inflicted through torture. """"We are concerned that civilians are being arbitrarily detained by military officers who are looking for suspected separatists,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. """"Only a thorough, impartial investigation can uncover what really happened in this case."""" Human Rights Watch called for an urgent, independent investigation into the torture allegations and death of Yapenas Murib and said that those responsible should be brought to justice. Human Rights Watch also reminded Indonesia of its obligations under the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to take immediate measures to stop the use of torture, and urged Jakarta to invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra-Judicial Executions to visit Papua. Human Rights Watch urged the authorities to allow all those in military custody in Wamena to be allowed access to family members and attorneys. Incommunicado detention in Indonesia has frequently led to torture and ill-treatment in the past. Nearly twenty other men are believed to be in custody at the Wamena KODIM, including: Kanius Murib Elias Tabuni Wim Logo Sam Telingan At least 15 other men, names unknownThese arrests by the Indonesian military occurred during the past two weeks, following a raid at the Wamena KODIM on April 4, 2003, when weapons and ammunition were stolen by a group of unknown persons. During the raid, two soldiers and one member of the attacking party were killed. The government blames the armed opposition separatist group OPM (Free Papua Movement) for the raid. The military has been carrying out sweeps in local villages in Wamena in efforts to find the perpetrators of the attack. Indonesian newspapers reported that two civilians, including Kanius Murib, and one soldier have now officially been named as suspects by the police for the April 4 attack. Human Rights Watch called for all the other detainees at the Wamena KODIM to be transferred to police custody and charged with a criminal offence, or otherwise released immediately. Human Rights Watch has documented serious human rights violations by the security forces in Papua, including the killing of civilians during counterinsurgency operations; the unnecessary and often lethal use of force against peaceful pro-independence demonstrators; torture and brutal beatings of detainees; ethnic and racial discrimination by government authorities; intimidation of journalists, human rights activists and others who attempt to expose abuses by the security forces; and arrest and imprisonment of Papuan leaders for nonviolent advocacy of independence.","Asia, Indonesia",""

The administration replied in writing last week to a letter from Human Rights Watch calling on President Bush to investigate and condemn allegations of torture and other cruel and inhuman treatment that emerged in press reports last December. According to unnamed U.S. officials quoted in those reports, the United States has subjected detainees at Bagram Air Force base in Afghanistan to sleep deprivation, holding them in awkward, painful positions, and other """"stress and duress"""" techniques of interrogation.  In its response to Human Rights Watch, signed by Department of Defense General Counsel William J. Haynes II, the administration states """"United States policy condemns torture."""" But it does not acknowledge that the United States has a legal obligation to refrain from cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The letter also fails to address whether the United States is using the specific """"stress and duress"""" techniques that have been widely reported over the past several months. Earlier statements by White House officials claimed that U.S. interrogators were acting in full compliance with domestic and international law.  """"The administration's response is totally inadequate,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Disavowing torture is welcome. But side-stepping detailed reports of mistreatment invites the conclusion that the reports are true. When combined with its claims that U.S. interrogators are acting lawfully, the Bush administration gives the impression that this kind of mistreatment is legitimate.""""  As a party to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the United States has accepted a legal obligation not to engage in torture or other forms of mistreatment. Interrogation techniques do not have to rise to the level of torture to be prohibited if they fall under the category of """"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.""""  Methods similar to those the United States is reportedly using have been found to be illegal mistreatment under international law, including in landmark decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights. The U.S. Department of State has condemned numerous countries for using similar techniques, such as sleep deprivation and placing prisoners in awkward, painful positions. Its annual human rights reports list these methods as forms of torture or other cruel or inhuman treatment.  """"The administration is sending a very unfortunate signal to other governments, including potential captors of U.S. soldiers, that such practices are acceptable,"""" Roth added. """"The U.S. government needs to unequivocally state that it is not engaging in the same kinds of cruel and inhuman treatment that it rightly condemns abroad.""""  In ratifying the UN Convention Against Torture, the United States limited its commitment regarding cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment only to conduct that is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution. The Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which bans cruel and unusual punishment, would clearly prohibit much of what reportedly is being done at Bagram.  The administration's letter does not state whether the U.S. government - either the Department of Defense or the CIA - instructs its officials to refrain from engaging in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of detainees. It does not indicate that the specific allegations are being investigated fully, and that anyone found to have engaged in cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment will be prosecuted or otherwise held accountable. The administration has also inadequately responded to reports that the United States has transferred suspects to the custody of countries that routinely practice torture. Human Rights Watch welcomes Haynes' statement that the U.S. government seeks assurances from foreign governments that they will not torture a detainee before handing him over. But he does not say whether the United States takes any steps to verify that governments are in fact treating rendered suspects humanely, or whether it takes any action if it learns that they are not. In its annual report on human rights practices, the Bush administration documents torture by the countries to which suspects have reportedly been handed over for interrogation, such as Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.  """"The Bush administration should not just accept assurances from the very same countries whose use of torture the U.S. government itself has documented,"""" said Roth. """"It's hardly reassuring to know that the administration is taking Egypt at its word on torture. If the Administration is following up on these cases and taking action to ensure transferred suspects are not tortured, it needs to say so.""""","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""

According to a report in yesterday’s Newsday, a Central Command spokeswoman has anonymously confirmed that U.S. forces have hit urban areas of Baghdad with cluster munitions, stating that they were aimed at Iraqi artillery and missile systems located inside the city.  “U.S. commanders should never use cluster munitions in populated areas,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “These are wholly inappropriate weapons when civilians are around. The reported use of cluster munitions in Baghdad is a serious charge and the Pentagon must respond publicly to it.”  Newsday’s reporter provided Human Rights Watch with a photograph he had taken inside a building in what he described as a clearly residential neighborhood well inside Baghdad. Human Rights Watch identified an unexploded cluster submunition in the photograph from either a ground-based Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) or an artillery projectile. The damage to the surrounding walls and floor were also consistent with a cluster munition strike. Human Rights Watch has previously reported that, according to The Pentagon’s own data, these particular submunitions have an especially high failure rate.  Human Rights Watch believes that the use of cluster munitions in populated areas may violate the prohibition of indiscriminate attacks contained in international humanitarian law. Despite the utility of cluster munitions in achieving certain military objectives, the wide dispersal pattern of their submunitions makes it very difficult to avoid civilians if they are in the area. Moreover, because of their high failure rate, cluster munitions leave large numbers of hazardous, explosive duds to terrorize civilians even after the attack is over.  The U.S. Army and Marine Corps may be taking less care to avoid civilian casualties with surface-delivered cluster munitions than the U.S. Air Force with air-delivered cluster munitions, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch conducted detailed analyses of the U.S. Air Force’s use of cluster bombs in the 1999 Yugoslavia war and the 2001-2002 Afghanistan war. In Afghanistan, the U.S. Air Force used cluster bombs substantially less often in populated areas than they had in Yugoslavia, and therefore caused far fewer civilian deaths with cluster bombs.  “It seemed that after Yugoslavia, U.S. commanders learned that cluster munitions cannot be safely used in populated areas,” said Roth. “The use of cluster munitions inside Baghdad represents a disturbing step backwards – with deadly consequences.”  It is not yet known if there were civilian casualties at the time of the strike, but Newsday reported on several deaths and injuries to children and others who encountered the explosive duds left by the cluster munitions which failed to detonate on initial impact as designed. The duds function as de facto antipersonnel landmines.  This is the first confirmed instance of U.S. use of cluster munitions in Baghdad or other highly populated areas. There have been many unconfirmed allegations of use of both air-dropped and surface-delivered cluster munitions in urban areas by the United States and the United Kingdom. Most notably, some press accounts attributed the deaths of scores of civilians near the village of Hilla in central Iraq on April 1 to U.S. cluster bombs, but the facts have not been established.  In light of its admission of use of cluster munitions, and the already documented deaths and injuries to children and other non-combatants, Human Rights Watch called on the United States to take responsibility with the utmost urgency for assuring:  the provision of warnings and risk education to the civilian population; the clear demarcation of affected areas in order to effectively exclude civilians; the rapid clearance of dangerous cluster munition duds.“The Pentagon is crowing about the Air Force sparing civilians by using only precision weapons in Baghdad,” said Roth. “But that’s a meaningless achievement if the Army then comes along and indiscriminately batters civilian neighborhoods with cluster munitions.”","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

Resolutions were rejected on the situation in Chechnya (15 yes, 21 no, 17 abstentions) and Sudan (24 yes, 26 no, 3 abstentions). The defeat of the Sudan resolution ends U.N. human rights monitoring there despite the ongoing conflict.  A resolution critical of Zimbabwe was blocked by a so-called no-action motion (28 yes, 24 no, 1 abstention), which prevents the commission from even debating the subject matter of a resolution and in effect amounts to a self-imposed ‘gag order.’  Resolutions were not even tabled on several countries previously under scrutiny at the commission, including parts of southeastern Europe (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro), Iran and Equatorial Guinea. A chairman’s statement on Afghanistan, drafted for final adoption next week, fails to endorse a proposal for an international commission of inquiry to address past crimes, or to call for an increase in U.N. human rights monitors.  These results repeated the pattern set at last year’s session, when the commission voted to stop monitoring of human rights abuses in Equatorial Guinea and Iran.  The commission did adopt critical resolutions on some countries, including for the first time on North Korea and Turkmenistan. The commission also expressed concern about ongoing human rights abuses in Israel and the Occupied Territories.  “Today’s voting shows that many commission members are more concerned with protecting each other than protecting the victims of human rights abuse,” said Joanna Weschler, U.N. Representative at Human Rights Watch. “It also highlights how Western governments have lost the political will to take action against abusive governments, particularly their newfound friends in the fight against terrorism.”  A growing bloc of repressive governments – including Algeria, China, Cuba, Libya, Russia, Sudan, Syria and Zimbabwe – have become progressively more aggressive in blocking or obstructing resolutions critical of any specific country. The African group voted as a bloc against action on Zimbabwe and (with the exception of Uganda) against the resolution on Sudan.  Western governments have weakened the commission’s response to some of the worst human rights situations. In a sudden and deeply disappointing shift in its approach, the United States decided not to co-sponsor a resolution on human rights violations in the Chechen conflict in Russia. Neither the United States nor the European Union tabled a resolution critical of China or Iran.  The European Union was nearly the only sponsor of country resolutions and took welcome new initiatives on North Korea and Turkmenistan. But on other country situations, the European Union showed internal discord, softening its criticism for instance on Chechnya.  Resolutions on Belarus, Burundi, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq will be voted on tomorrow.  “The commission is trapped between governments intent on undermining it and those that lack the political will to take them on,” Weschler said. “This year’s session underlines once again the urgent need to reform the commission, starting with the establishment of clear criteria for membership.”  Human Rights Watch has argued that, as a prerequisite for membership of the commission, governments should have ratified core human rights treaties, complied with their reporting obligations, issued open invitations to U.N. human rights experts and not have been condemned recently by the commission for human rights violations.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Afghanistan, China and Tibet, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Russia, Algeria, Iran, Libya, Syria",""

The aborted UN mission is a symptom of deeper problems. Frustration is growing as Rangoon's ruling generals appear increasingly distrustful and unwilling to continue a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi, leader of the democratic opposition. On Wednesday, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is expected to adopt a resolution condemning Burma for repression. The commission will call for steps to improve human rights and cooperation with the UN secretary general's special envoy, Razali Ismail, in his efforts to facilitate dialogue between Burma's military and the opposition. The commission's action will send a useful signal, but it won't be enough. As Pinheiro said in Geneva, """"It is more than urgent that the current deadlock be overcome and that the human rights situation"""" in Burma improves. Japan and the United States, working in concert, could help break the impasse by increasing both diplomatic and economic pressure. Since Aung San Suu Kyi's release from house arrest in May, there has been only limited progress. According to the ruling State Peace and Development Council in Burma, more than 500 political prisoners were released in the past three years, but only 63 since January. Others have been arrested and the United Nations estimates that from 1,200 to 1,300 political prisoners remain locked up. The International Committee of the Red Cross has been allowed to establish a presence in conflict areas of Burma and this is a welcome step. Reports of systematic rapes by the Burmese army in Shan state have triggered calls for an independent investigation by the UN, and at least in principle, the government in Rangoon has agreed. But tight restrictions on basic freedoms remain throughout Burma, abuses against ethnic minorities continue, poverty is acute and the economy is in bad shape and getting worse. The United States and Japan have emphasized different approaches toward Burma. Washington has pushed for sanctions, while Tokyo has focused on engagement. Japan has also signaled its interest in trying to jump-start the process leading to a democratic transition. This year, Tokyo hosted a UN conference on Burma, attended by representatives of member states of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Nations, as well as the United States, European governments and other countries. The Bush administration is considering imposing tougher economic measures. At a recent congressional hearing, a State Department official warned that in the absence of progress, """"we will be forced to consider, in conjunction with the international community, additional sanctions."""" A bill cutting off all exports to the United States from Burma will be introduced soon in Congress, and could easily pass. In this climate of increasing disappointment, Japan should play a more proactive role. The foreign ministry should consider appointing a senior diplomat to follow up the Tokyo conference by visiting the ASEAN capitals to urge them to intervene with Burma, which is a member of ASEAN. In seeking to influence Burma, ASEAN countries should focus on specific steps that Pinheiro has recommended: agreement for a return visit to Rangoon by Razali, release of political prisoners, and the lifting of restrictions on free expression, assembly and association that would allow space for legitimate, peaceful political activities. Japan is a major donor and investor in Southeast Asia, so its voice carries weight. It is in ASEAN's interest to promote change in Rangoon, if for no other reason than to offset China's influence. The United Nations agencies working in Burma are preparing an assessment of humanitarian conditions and a framework for urgently needed assistance. Once it is made public, Japan should offer to provide additional aid to meet the needs of Burma's people, provided through the UN and nongovernment organizations. But Tokyo shouldn't give any new aid to Burma until there is substantial progress by the government to improve human rights and engage in political dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the democratic opposition. A clear statement on aid policy for Burma should be delivered by Japan. It would also be useful for Japan to begin discouraging private companies from considering investing there. Many Japanese companies are already reluctant to get involved in Burma's corrupt economy or to invest unless Japanese government aid is forthcoming. A decision by Japan to discourage investment would buttress the impact of U.S. sanctions and send a strong, united signal. Burma's economic and social problems can only be effectively addressed if the government is willing to allow real change. Tokyo and Washington should work together to make a better future possible for Burma's people. Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington D.C.

Human Rights Watch said that U.S. and coalition forces have failed to bring law and order to Kirkuk and ensure the security of civilians, and therefore contravene the Geneva Convention provisions specifying the obligations of an occupying power.  Widespread looting and destruction of property are affecting all ethnic groups in the city, while the situation outside of Kirkuk appears even more precarious, Human Rights Watch said. A Human Rights Watch team documented the expulsion of Arabs living in villages south of Kirkuk, on the basis of what one official said were policy decisions by the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).  “Kirkuk right now is a tinderbox,” said Hania Mufti, London director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “U.S. troops must stop the violence. And PUK leaders should take immediate steps to halt any expulsions of Iraqi Arabs from their homes.”  Human Rights Watch said that the U.S. and interim Iraqi authorities, including Kurdish representatives, should take steps to establish as soon as possible a mechanism to settle claims over disputed property and other assets.  Human Rights Watch researchers spent four days in Kirkuk following the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from the city on April 10, documenting civilian deaths, forced expulsions, and other abuses committed by all ethnic groups. The researchers interviewed Arab families forcibly expelled from their homes, eyewitnesses to reprisal killings, and Kurdish and Turkoman officials. The researchers also examined hospital and morgue records.  Killings of Civilians Since April 10, at least 40 civilians have been killed in the city. Many of them appear to have died as a result of clashes between armed civilians and Ba’ath Party officials. According to forensic records, at least two died from close range single gunshot wounds to the head, and a third, whose hands were bound, bore lesions on the neck consistent with hanging.  Forced Expulsions On April 13, Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed Arabs from the al-Shummar tribe who had fled four villages south of Kirkuk soon after Kurdish forces had taken control of the area. Some of the villagers said a local Kurdish official had given them written notification to leave their homes within three days.  Soon thereafter, nearly 2,000 residents from the villages of al-Muntasir, Khalid, al-Wahda and Umar Ibn al-Khattab took refuge in tents and homes of fellow tribal members in the village of Sa’ad bin Abi Waqqas and its vicinity. Several of the displaced said they had been forced from their homes at gunpoint, while their possessions, including cars, tractors, and household goods, were taken away. “They would have killed us if we hadn’t left,” an elderly woman said.  Human Rights Watch investigators found the village of al-Muntasir abandoned and ransacked. The doors of several homes in the village had been spray-painted with the names of Kurds to whom the Kurdish authorities had evidently given permission to eventually occupy the homes. When Human Rights Watch questioned a PUK official in the nearby town of Daqouq about the expulsions, he said they had been carried out on the basis of a policy decision taken by the PUK’s Political Bureau.  This policy, according to the official, stated that all persons who had been resettled from their original homes to other parts to the country by the Iraqi government in the past should return to these homes. This policy, the PUK official said, “has been approved by U.S. and coalition forces.” No independent confirmation or denial of these forces’ approval was immediately available.  While senior PUK officials in Arbil told Human Rights Watch researchers that they had given assurances to representatives of the al-Shummar tribe that they need not vacate their homes, this does not appear to have been implemented on the ground.  Human Rights Watch said that the United States, as the occupying power, has a responsibility to act to prevent human rights abuses. According to international law, an occupying power has a duty to restore and ensure public order in the territory under its authority. Under the 1949 Geneva Conventions (Fourth Geneva Convention article 6), the duty attaches as soon as the occupying force exercises control or authority over civilians of that territory.  Military commanders must prevent and where necessary suppress serious violations involving the local population under their control or subject to their authority. The occupying force is responsible for protecting the population from violence by third parties, such as newly formed armed groups or forces of the former regime. Ensuring local security includes protecting persons, including minority groups and former government officials, from reprisals and revenge attacks.  Background In 1973, as part of the Iraqi government’s policy to permanently settle Arab nomadic tribes from central and southern Iraq, families from the al-Shummar tribe were resettled in the al-Iskan area, some 28 kms south of Kirkuk city. They were given homes as well as agricultural land that belonged to forcibly displaced Kurds. A small number of families had settled there following the 1991 Gulf war. They had been living in Kuwait and were part of that country’s bidun community, to whom the Kuwaiti government had denied nationality. Some of these families fled to Iraq prior to the war, and the Kuwaiti government later refused to re-admit them after the cessation of hostilities.  In 1975, following the collapse of the Kurdish revolt led by Mulla Mustafa Barzani, the Iraqi government embarked on an extensive “Arabization” program of the northern Kurdish provinces, expelling tens of thousands of Kurds, Turkomans and Assyrians from their homes and replacing them with Arab families from southern Iraq. At least 120,000 people belonging to these ethnic minorities were expelled since 1991, most of them Kurds.

The U.N. Security Council is holding consultations on Cote d’Ivoire on April 15. Human Rights Watch urged the Security Council to establish a human rights monitoring mission with a field presence in Côte d’Ivoire, and to call on neighboring states to keep their borders open to refugees from the war.  According to recent Human Rights Watch research, both government and rebel forces in western Côte d’Ivoire are responsible for massacres of civilians, rape, reprisal killings and systematic looting. Liberian combatants fighting on both sides are committing many of the abuses.  “Liberian fighters are playing a major role in this war, and civilians are paying the price,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “We’ve seen this pattern before in West Africa. The Security Council needs to act now to prevent any further deterioration in Côte d’Ivoire.”  Takirambudde said that the civil wars in Liberia and Sierra Leone had shown the same pattern of targeting civilians, and warned that the war in western Côte d’Ivoire threatened a similar degree of civilian suffering.  Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to encourage the West African peacekeeping force known as ECOFORCE and the French military to protect civilians. The United Nations should also urge neighboring and regional states to cooperate with the Special Court in Sierra Leone with regard to indicted individuals.","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire, Liberia","United Nations"

Security Council on Western Côte d'Ivoire and Liberian Fighters' Involvement in the Fighting","","04/14/2003","Your Excellency,   Human Rights Watch writes to apprise members of the Security Council of the deteriorating human rights situation in western Côte d'Ivoire, and to recommend actions that the Security Council should take to address the crisis. Unless immediate steps are taken to contain the conflict in the west of the country and the human rights abuses that have accompanied it, the fragile peace in Côte d'Ivoire may collapse and further threaten regional stability.   The situation in western Côte d'Ivoire requires the Security Council's attention due to the urgent need for protection of civilians as well as the cross-border character of the conflict. As described below, both government and rebel forces have introduced Liberian fighters into the fighting in western Côte d'Ivoire, and the conflict there increasingly is becoming an extension of the neighboring Liberian war.   Over the past two months, Human Rights Watch has gathered information from refugees and displaced civilians in Côte d'Ivoire, Guinea, Mali, and Burkina Faso who provide consistent and compelling descriptions of the severe human rights situation. It is clear that extensive abuses, including killings, rape, and systematic looting of civilian property, are taking place in areas where access is very limited, making independent documentation and verification very difficult. This underscores the critical need for further investigation of abuses in the west.   Background to the current fighting   The current area of concern stretches roughly between Toulepleu and Danane, on the Liberian border, east to Man and Guiglo.   On November 28, 2002, two new rebel groups - the Movement for Justice and Peace (Mouvement pour la Justice et la Paix, MJP) and the Ivoirian Popular Movement for the Great West (Mouvement Populaire Ivoirien du Grand Ouest, MPIGO) - emerged and captured Danane and Man. They then continued south to take Toulepleu and Bloléquin in early December. Since December 2002, the area has become the main theater of the Ivoirien conflict.   A ceasefire agreement was signed by the MJP and MPIGO rebel groups and the government on January 13, 2003. However, the agreement has been violated numerous times by both sides.   Until April 9, 2003, rebel forces controlled north of Toulepleu and government forces controlled Toulepleu town and the road west to Bloléquin. As of April 11, 2003, a government offensive was moving north and was reported to have captured Zouan-Hounien.   Abuses of civilians in western Côte d'Ivoire   Both the government and the rebel forces have been responsible for violations of international humanitarian law, including rape, attacks on civilians, systematic looting of civilian property and executions of suspected enemy sympathizers. At least two massacres have been reported in the area in March 2003, in Bangolo and Dah, with at least one hundred civilian deaths from the two incidents. According to civilians who fled these two locations, Liberians and Ivoiriens fighting for the government of Côte d'Ivoire were responsible for the killings in Bangolo, while rebel fighters were responsible for the killings in Dah. Human Rights Watch was not able to travel to these sites and further investigation is required.   Both the government and the rebel forces have also been responsible for reprisal killings, particularly when towns have changed hands. This was the case in Man in December 2002, when a loyalist counteroffensive captured the town and held it for approximately ten days, and in Toulepleu, which was captured by rebels in December 2002 and then re-taken by the government in January 2003. Reprisal killings by government forces have often been based on ethnic, national, or political affiliation, while rebel forces have targeted government officials or suspected government sympathizers. It is essential that both warring parties protect civilians and make every effort to minimize civilian casualties in any future offensives in the area.   Even where conflict on the ground has not targeted civilians, government helicopter gunships have been responsible for civilian casualties. Human Rights Watch has documented several incidents in which civilians have been the victims of indiscriminate attacks by helicopter gunships. A December 2002 attack on Mahapleu, for instance, resulted in at least nine civilian victims when a helicopter gunship fired into a crowd of civilians at the local market from a distance of sixty meters, a clear violation of international humanitarian law.   The government's renewed use of helicopter gunships in Bin-Houyé and Danane during the week of April 7, 2003, may be a cause for concern, although it is not yet clear whether these attacks were limited to military targets. It must be added that in several incidents, the rebel forces also bear responsibility for not clearly separating military targets from civilian sites. For example, the deployment of military forces near civilians led to civilian deaths in a helicopter attack on Vavua town in December 2002.   Thousands of Ivoirien and ECOWAS nationals have fled the western region via Liberia only to be refused entry at the Guinean border. The recent intensification of the Liberian war has trapped thousands of civilians who now must choose between two untenable options - remaining in Liberia amidst growing conflict or returning to western Côte d'Ivoire.   Liberian involvement with rebel forces in western Côte d'Ivoire   One of the alarming developments in the west has been the recruitment and use of Liberian fighters by both rebel and government forces. Some of these fighters have been implicated in serious human rights abuses in Liberia and Sierra Leone.   Human Rights Watch interviewed civilians who fled Danane, Zouan-Hounien, and other towns and villages controlled by rebel groups in the past few months. According to these accounts, the western rebel forces contain Ivoirien, Sierra Leonean, and Liberian fighters. However, Liberians constitute the largest proportion of the western rebel forces. Victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch consistently stated that English-speaking Liberians were responsible for systematic looting of civilian property - regardless of the ethnicity of their victims - accompanied by assault and, in some cases, the rape of women and girls.   Credible sources have stated that among the Sierra Leoneans fighting alongside the rebels are some former RUF fighters, including Sam Bockarie (""""Mosquito""""), who was recently indicted by the Sierra Leone Special Court.   Liberian involvement with government forces in western Côte d'Ivoire   Several hundred of the Liberians fighting alongside the government forces are former refugees who have either been recruited or felt compelled to join the government forces in order to demonstrate their loyalty in the face of increased anti-Liberian feeling in Côte d'Ivoire.   According to civilians who fled Toulepleu, Bloléquin and other villages under the control of government forces, the majority of the armed forces in these locations are Liberians, although there are also some local Ivoiriens among the fighters. Human Rights Watch documented cases of systematic looting of property and rape of civilians in this area.   Human Rights Watch also gathered accounts of children among the Liberian fighters on both sides, many of whom are as young as nine and according to one description, """"cannot even control the weight of their guns.""""   While both the government and rebel forces bear responsibility for introducing Liberian combatants into the Ivoirien conflict, it is apparent that neither side exerts full control over their Liberian fighters, and that western Côte d'Ivoire has become an extension of the neighboring Liberian war.   The abuses are manipulated by both the government of Côte d'Ivoire and the rebel groups through political rhetoric and local media in order to further their respective political agendas. This trend threatens to undermine the recent steps to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.   Recommendations    The gravity of the situation in western Côte d'Ivoire demands Security Council action. Human Rights Watch recommends that the Security Council take the following steps:  Immediately call on all parties to the conflict in Côte d'Ivoire to respect human rights and international humanitarian law regarding treatment of civilians and other non-combatants, and to hold accountable members of their forces responsible for abuses;  Establish a human rights monitoring mission in Côte d'Ivoire, with appropriate human, financial and technical resources, which reports to the Security Council. The monitoring mission should have the mandate to report on violations of human rights and humanitarian law by all sides to the conflict, including Liberian combatants, and should make recommendations about mechanisms for holding perpetrators accountable. The monitoring mission should have as extensive a field presence as possible, including in Daloa, Bouaké, San Pedro, and, security permitting, Man. The mission's reports should be made public;  Call on all states in the region - including Burkina Faso, Côte d'Ivoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gambia, Ghana, Liberia, Libya, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Zambia - to commit to returning any individuals indicted by the Special Court of Sierra Leone who flee into their territories, to assist in their apprehension, and to otherwise cooperate with the Special Court;  Call on all neighboring states, in particular Guinea, to keep borders open to all civilians fleeing the conflict in western Côte d'Ivoire, including nationals of ECOWAS countries attempting to enter via Liberia;  Urge ECOWAS forces together with French forces supporting them, to ensure that civilians are protected from physical violence in accordance with Security Council Resolution 1464 (2003).

Questioned about the orgy of looting and pillaging taking place under the gaze of U.S. forces, Rumsfeld criticized the media for exaggerating the extent of the damage. """"The images you are seeing on television, you are seeing over and over and over,"""" he complained. """"It's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase and you see it twenty times. And you think, my goodness, were there that many vases?"""" After pausing for laughter, Rumsfeld delivered the punch line: """"Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?"""" Well, yes, as it turns out, it is possible. And the loss of such artifacts is no laughing matter, at least to people who care about these things. Many of the irreplaceable objects lost in Baghdad's days of anarchy and turmoil were thousands of years old, material evidence of humanity's earliest strivings. They came from places like Babylon, Kalkhu, Nineveh and Ur, ancient cities dating back to the dawn of history. Last week, after two days of unhindered pillage, the Baghdad museum that housed these treasures was emptied. By Friday afternoon, when Rumsfeld made his dismissive remarks, looters were carting away the last spoils. According to the museum's deputy director, who blamed U.S. forces for refusing to prevent the plunder, at least 170,000 items were taken or destroyed. The pillage of the National Museum of Iraq should have come as no surprise. And if the risks were obvious, the legal responsibilities were equally clear. The Lessons of Gulf War I In 1991, at the close of the first Gulf War, nine of Iraq's regional museums were looted by rampaging mobs opposed to Saddam Hussein's government. While the national museum did not come under attack at that time, because the government retained firm control over Baghdad, it lost a number of artifacts that had been transferred to the regional museums for safekeeping. In all, about 4,000 items were stolen or destroyed during the 1991 looting spree, including some that were thousands of years old. Some of the pieces were later smuggled out of Iraq, and were, by the following year, turning up at art auctions and in the hands of dealers in London and New York. The lessons of this close precedent were not lost on archaeologists and scholars of antiquity. Well prior to the outbreak of the current war, they warned the Pentagon of the dangers to Iraq's cultural heritage posed by postwar pillage and destruction. The Legal Responsibility to Protect Cultural Property Under the laws of war, the United States is obligated to ensure public order in territories that it occupies, and to prevent looting and other forms of lawlessness. More specifically, it is required to protect museums and other cultural property against damage. The primary international treaty on this point is the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict, drafted in 1954. The convention specifies that an occupying power must take necessary measures to safeguard and preserve the cultural property of the occupied country. Because this rule codifies customary international law, it is binding even on countries such as the United States that have signed but not ratified the convention. (Iraq, in contrast, is a party to the convention, as are 102 other countries.) Interestingly, international rules to protect cultural property from looting and damage are an American innovation, dating back to the Civil War. Revulsion at widespread destruction during that war led to the drafting of the Lieber Code, which gave protected status to libraries, scientific collections and works of art. The Lieber Code's protections had a significant influence on the development on international law in this area, culminating in the drafting of the 1954 convention and its subsequent protocols. Of course, the U.S. responsibility to protect Iraq's cultural property is not absolute. Legitimate battlefield demands might well take priority over the duty to protect. But even if an investigation is necessary to clarify whether U.S. forces failed in their duties, the evidence of negligence available so far is compelling. Not only did the Pentagon have prior notice of the likelihood of looting, museum officials reportedly called on troops to stop the plunder just after it began. At the urging of an Iraqi archaeologist, a group of marines with a tank opened fire above looters' heads and drove them away. But instead of staying to protect the building, the marines left, and the looters returned. The museum's deputy director decried the American refusal to help: """"If they had [provided] just one tank and two soldiers nothing like this would have happened."""" Rumsfeld's Response """"Stuff happens,"""" Rumsfeld told a Pentagon news briefing on April 11, when asked about widespread looting in Baghdad. """"But,"""" he continued, """"it is a fundamental misunderstanding to see those images over and over and over again of some boy walking out with a vase and say, 'Oh, my goodness, you didn't have a plan.' That's nonsense."""" Two days later, faced with overwhelming proof of mayhem in Baghdad, Rumsfeld again disavowed responsibility for the looters' rampage. When the interviewer pointed out that Iraqi museum officials claimed that they had asked the U.S. military to protect the museum, and that the military had refused, Rumsfeld responded: """"Oh, my goodness. Look, I have no idea."""" Looting, he concluded """"isn't something that someone allows or doesn't allow. It's something that happens."""" An Avoidable Disaster Looting most definitely happens when the authorities take no steps to prevent it. Unfortunately, the evidence suggests that this was the case with Iraq's National Museum and its priceless collection of artifacts. The New York Times, in an article published yesterday, said that the ransacking of the National Museum will probably be remembered as """"one of the greatest cultural disasters in recent Middle Eastern history."""" What is worse, it is likely to be remembered as a disaster that was avoidable.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

Looters in Baghdad have ransacked hospitals and medical facilities, endangering the health of the local population. In some areas, armed clashes between property owners and looters have broken out. Isolated reports of vengeance killings have begun to emerge as Iraqi civilians and uncontrolled armed groups begin searching for suspected supporters of Saddam Hussein.  During the brief 1991 uprisings in Iraq, vengeance killings took the lives of thousands of people who were suspected of links to the government of Saddam Hussein. Many were innocent civilians.  Some U.S. government officials have seemed unaware of their obligations under international law to act promptly to prevent looting and other disturbances.  """"Coalition forces have to stop the lawlessness now,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Restoring public order is an urgent matter and it has to be a top priority if serious harm to civilians is going to be avoided.""""  U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said yesterday, """"While no one condones looting, on the other hand, one can understand the pentup feelings that may result from decades of repression and people who have had members of their family killed by that regime, for them to be taking their feelings out on that regime."""" Secretary Rumsfeld has also said the U.S. forces will patrol Iraqi cities to prevent lawlessness, but reports from the field suggest that coalition forces are not doing enough to prevent disturbances.  U.S. Maj. Gen. Stanley McChrystal said on April 10 that """"Looting is a problem, but it is not a major threat. People are not being killed in looting. So that's something we have to do as we have the time and capability to do it.""""  Under international humanitarian law, or the laws of war, an occupying power has a duty to restore and ensure public order and safety in the territory under its authority. Military commanders on the spot must prevent and where necessary suppress serious violations involving the local population. Ensuring local security includes protecting people from reprisals and revenge attacks, such as those directed against members of minority populations or government officials. This may require that occupying forces be deployed to secure public order until the time police personnel, whether local or international, can be mobilized for such responsibilities.  """"This lawlessness is something for which the coalition forces should have been prepared,"""" Roth said.  An occupying power also has a duty under international law to ensure food and medical services to the population """"to the fullest extent of the means available to it."""" Medical personnel, including recognized Red Cross/Red Crescent societies, should be allowed to carry out their duties. Should any part of the population of an occupied territory be inadequately supplied, the occupying power is obligated to facilitate relief by humanitarian agencies. However, the provision of assistance by humanitarian agencies does not relieve the occupying force of its responsibilities to meet the needs of the population.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, United Kingdom",""

In letters to the six states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- Human Rights Watch strongly urged their leaders to endorse the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. Nearly ten million foreigners, most of them unskilled and semi-skilled migrants, work in the GCC states. Some 5.5 million are employed in Saudi Arabia, where foreigners comprise one-third of the population. In Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, non-citizens are in the majority and total about 4.4 million people.  “Saudi Arabia and the other GCC states have a special responsibility to participate in all international efforts to guarantee rights and justice for this vulnerable population,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “Becoming parties to the migrant rights convention will signal the GCC’s willingness to help address a serious worldwide problem.”  The convention was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on December 18, 1990, and will enter into force on July 1, 2003. It promotes and protects the rights of migrant workers and their families and applies not only to documented workers -- migrants who are in compliance with local law – but also to those who lack or have lost legal authorization for residency and employment, described in the treaty as persons in “irregular situations.”  “In the Gulf states, documented migrants can easily slip into illegal status through no fault of their own,” said Megally. “Unscrupulous employers and sponsors deliberately let residence permits expire, or literally sell workers to other employers, thereby invalidating their work permits. Desperate migrants also flee terrible working conditions and end up outside the law.”  The convention guarantees basic human rights to all migrants, including the rights to life, due process, fair trials, and freedom of expression and religion, as well as equal treatment with nationals in respect to economic and social rights. Its provisions also address the following key problems found in the GCC states: Intimidation and violence Migrants, including large numbers of women employed as domestic servants, face intimidation and violence at the hands of employers, supervisors, sponsors, and police and security forces. Intimidated by violence or the threat of it, workers are often afraid to demand unpaid wages, protest poor conditions, or seek legal recourse for abuses. Article  16(2) of the convention guarantees to migrants and their families “effective protection by the State against violence, physical injury, threats and intimidation, whether by public officials or by private individuals, groups or institutions.” Restrictions on freedom of movement Sponsors and employers continue to confiscate migrants’ documents, including passports and residence permits. This severely restricts freedom of movement and limits migrants’ ability to report mistreatment to authorities without risking arrest, imprisonment, and steep fines. Article 21 of the convention prohibits anyone other than a duly authorized public official from confiscating such vital documents, and requires that migrant workers receive detailed receipts when their documents are legally confiscated.  Migrants in the GCC states typically cannot obtain an exit visa to leave the country of employment without the approval of their sponsor or employer; arbitrary denials of exit visas can place migrants in situations that amount to forced labor. Article 8 of the convention reaffirms the right of migrant workers and their families to leave any state.  Trafficking and forced labor Migrants in undocumented or “irregular” situations are among the most vulnerable. Recruiters in their home countries traffic migrants en masse, promising them jobs and salaries that never materialize. These workers have often paid recruiters significant sums to secure what they believed were legally enforceable contracts and work visas. Deeply in debt and with no other options once they arrive, they have little choice but to work for local sponsors or employers under highly exploitative conditions that effectively amount to forced labor or servitude. The convention stipulates that migrant workers and members of their families may not be held in “servitude” or “required to perform forced or compulsory labor.” Article 68(1) calls for cooperation among States parties to prevent and eliminate such “illegal or clandestine movements and employment,” and requires states to undertake the following measures: prevent the dissemination of misleading information relating to emigration and immigration; detect and eradicate illegal or clandestine movements of migrant workers and members of their families; impose effective sanctions on persons, groups or entities that organize, operate or assist in organizing or operating such movements; impose effective sanctions on persons, groups or entities that use violence, threats or intimidation against migrant workers or members of their families in an irregular situation; and impose sanctions on employers of workers in irregular situations, whenever appropriate.Restrictions on the right to organize and join trade unions In all the Gulf states, laws and regulations either prohibit or restrict migrants’ participation in independent trade union activities. Article 40(1) of the convention provides for the right of migrants “to form associations and trade unions in the State of employment for the promotion and protection of their economic, social, cultural and other interests.” Article 26 affirms the right to join such groups and freely participate in their meetings and other activities.","Middle East/North Africa, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

The 39-page report, """"Testing Democracy: Political Violence in Nigeria,"""" documents numerous cases of political violence across Nigeria and discusses the weak response by government and police to date. Starting with local government primaries for the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP) in 2002, Nigeria has seen an increase in violent clashes between political factions led by politicians and their supporters at all levels of government.  """"The success of Nigeria's new democracy depends on stemming this kind of violence,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. """"President Obasanjo has said a lot recently about the need to act, but he hasn't brought most of the perpetrators to justice.""""  The Human Rights Watch report is based on research in Nigeria during December 2002 and February 2003, and includes several case studies that illustrate patterns of violence across different states, highlighting the theme of impunity. Although police carried out arrests in some of the more high profile cases, very few have led to successful prosecutions. The cases include:  In Delta State: Disputes over the distribution of electoral wards among ethnic groups in and around Warri caused large-scale outbreaks of violence in February and March 2003. Dozens of people were killed and several villages were destroyed in fighting, first between the Urhobos and Itsekiris, then between the Ijaws and Itsekiris. A large military contingent was deployed to the area in March amid reports of indiscriminate attacks by the security forces on Ijaw communities, whom they held responsible for the killing of four soldiers. In Bayelsa State: In July 2002, dozens of people were killed when two youth groups in Ogbolomabiri clashed during the PDP local government primaries. One of the groups was supported by then-Commissioner for the Environment in the Bayelsa State government, the other by a manager of President Obasanjo's 1999 election campaign in Bayelsa. Neither leader has been prosecuted. In Rivers State: Fighting between the PDP and the opposition All Nigeria People's Party (ANPP) in August 2002, in the lead-up to the voter registration exercise in Ogu/Bolo local government, resulted in the displacement of hundreds of non-PDP supporters. Several people active in local politics have disappeared or been killed since then. A politically motivated attack resulting in serious injury to a young man in the Ogoni area, and the armed invasion of the home of an Ogoni activist in the state capital Port Harcourt, are also documented. In Kwara State: A conflict between Governor Mohammed Lawal and his former political mentor, Olusola Saraki, has led to numerous violent incidents. In August 2002, as Saraki and his supporters shifted from the ANPP (the governor's party) to the PDP, the state PDP chairman, Ahmed Pategi, was killed. Armed supporters of the governor killed two people at a wedding ceremony in September 2002. In November 2002, a bomb exploded in the office of a newspaper owned by Olusola Saraki's son, Bukola Saraki, injuring five people. Lawal and Bukola Saraki will face each other as candidates for governor on April 19. In Enugu State: A split in the State House of Assembly between supporters and opponents of Governor Chimaroke Nnamani has led to a political crisis and outbreaks of violence including the beating of legislators and the presence of armed thugs on the house of assembly grounds. In Plateau State: Plateau has experienced recurring violence between ethnic groups considering themselves natives or """"indigenes"""" of the state and those they view as """"settlers."""" This division has manifested itself in political violence. Scores of people were killed in May 2002 in a fight that erupted at a venue of PDP local government primaries and spread to surrounding neighborhoods in Jos, the state capital of Plateau.The report documents several high-profile assassinations, including the killing on March 5 of Marshall Harry, vice chairman for the south-south zone of the opposition ANPP, who was an outspoken critic of the Rivers State governor.  While the report assigns primary responsibility for preventing and punishing cases of political violence to the Nigerian government and police, political parties were also urged to strengthen the disciplinary processes within their parties, and to adopt and publicize a pro-human rights and anti-violence stance.  The report discusses the role of foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations in supporting peaceful elections. International delegations from the European Union, the Commonwealth, and the United States will observe certain stages of the Nigerian elections. Human Rights Watch urged these groups to make plans to also monitor local government elections, where the risk of violence could be even higher. Foreign governments are urged to put pressure publicly on the Nigerian government to prevent and prosecute specific cases of political violence.","Africa, Nigeria",""

Should Censure Russia Over Chechnya Abuses","Three “Disappearances” a Week Documented","04/09/2003","The United Nations Commission on Human Rights should adopt a strong resolution condemning abuses in Chechnya and Russia’s failure to investigate them, Human Rights Watch said today. In a briefing paper published today for the commission, Human Rights Watch said that abuses by Russia’s forces appear to be on the rise. Based on more than fifty interviews conducted in the region in late March, the briefing paper details new cases of extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, and torture.  The Russian government has not complied with resolutions on Chechnya adopted by the Commission in 2000 and 2001.  “The Commission cannot turn a blind eye to atrocities that have continued unabated for three and a half years,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. “If it is to uphold its authority and credibility on human rights, the commission has to take Russia to task.”  During its March mission Human Rights Watch documented the forced disappearances of forty-four men. Twenty-six of the disappearances occurred between late December 2002 and late February 2003—an average of about three “disappearances” per week. In all cases, the individuals “disappeared” after being taken into custody by federal forces. Human Rights Watch also documented five extrajudicial killings and twelve cases of torture, all of which occurred after December 2002.  Unpublished government statistics on incidents of violent crimes in Chechnya confirm the high level of violence there. According to these statistics, which were made available to Human Rights Watch, in 2002 1,132 civilians were killed in Chechnya, or between ten and fifteen times the murder rate for Moscow. Another report, providing crime statistics for the first months of 2003, stated that for January and February there were seventy murders, 126 abductions, and twenty-five cases in which human corpses were found. Accompanying the statistics are detailed descriptions of more than 185 crimes in Chechnya committed in January and February 2003. In thirty-eight of these, involving sixty-four victims, federal forces are implicated by the involvement of armored personnel carriers (which Chechens rebels do not use), and of large numbers of uniformed men speaking Russian without a Northern Caucasus accent.  “Both our research and the official data on crime in Chechnya belie the Russian government’s claims of normalization in the region,” said Andersen.  Human Rights Watch said that a commission resolution should call on Russia to:  invigorate the domestic accountability process; publish a comprehesive, detailed list of investigation into abuses; issue invitations to relevant U.N. human rights monitors; and agree to an OSCE presence in Chechnya with a strong human rights mandate. Last year, the commission narrowly defeated a resolution on Chechnya. Russian authorities interpreted the resolution’s failure as a signal that the international community now endorsed its actions in Chechnya.  “The commission has to stand up for its principles, and say resoundingly that it does not endorse Russia’s abusive actions in Chechnya,” said Andersen.  Several cases from the Human Rights Watch briefing paper:  On the night of January 4, 2003, several dozen masked and armed men, who arrived on armored personnel carriers and other military vehicles, simultaneously burst into the Mazhiev family’s three apartments in Grozny. Aishat Mazhieva told Human Rights Watch that the men took away her husband and youngest son, a ballet dancer with the “Vainakh” dance group, and her two other sons who lived in adjacent apartments with their families. Despite numerous attempts by Mazhieva to find her husband and three sons their fate remained unknown. “Malika K.” told Human Rights Watch that on February 16, 2003, a group of about fifteen armed and masked men in uniforms riding in military vehicles and speaking unaccented Russian took away her two sons, “Kharon” and “Aslanbek.” The armed men took the brothers to an ad hoc detention center in Grozny, where they questioned Aslanbek K., beating him with a rifle butt on his face, legs, and kidneys; they broke his nose in several places with a heavy metal flashlight. It is unclear when Kharon was killed; on February 17, the guards loaded Aslanbek K. and his brother’s corpse in a car and drove them to a an abandoned chemical plant where they tied the two together, placed them under a large slab of concrete and put explosives between their bodies. Before leaving, they fired a bullet at Aslanbek’s head but missed, causing only a superficial wound. Aslanbek K. managed to free himself before the explosives went off, and return home.

The release comes on the 100th day of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's administration Children face violence at the hands of other youths, are unnecessarily confined to their cells for lengthy periods of time, and often do not receive the schooling to which the Brazilian constitution entitles them, Human Rights Watch said.  """"President Lula has vowed to prioritize the needs of the most vulnerable,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If he is to make good on that promise, his administration must address the systemic human rights abuses committed against detained children.""""  Brazil is a federation of states, much like the United States, and each state controls its own juvenile detention system. But the federal government has a key role in enforcing the national juvenile justice law. And the federal government can condition its funding of state juvenile detention systems on their compliance with human rights norms.  Human Rights Watch's 63-page report, Cruel Confinement: Abuses Against Detained Children in Northern Brazil, is based on interviews with 44 detained youth, as well as dozens of additional interviews with government officials, lawyers, social workers, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations. Human Rights Watch inspected a total of 17 detention facilities, including four girls' detention center, in the states of Amapá, Amazonas, Maranhão, Rondônia, and Pará.  Police beatings during and after arrest are common, the report found. Such abuses often occur at police stations, where Brazilian law allows children to be held for up to five days while they await transfer to a juvenile detention facility. In rural areas, where police routinely violate the five-day limit on detention in police lockups, children are at greater risk of police abuse.  Once children are transferred to detention centers, they must often endure further violence from state military police, who are charged with ensuring the external security of detention centers, quelling riots and other disturbances, responding to escape attempts, and conducting cell searches. Children who complained of beatings often reported that military police hit them with cassetetes, rubber batons with a metal core.  Girls often lack basic medical care and generally do not receive recreational opportunities on par with those afforded boys. They appeared to spend much of their recreation time sewing, engaged in other crafts, or asleep.  Human Rights Watch called on Brazil's state authorities to provide meaningful complaint mechanisms to youths in detention and fully investigate all complaints of abuse. Detention centers should take steps to protect children from abuse at the hands of other youths. State authorities should also end the routine use of cell restriction upon admission and prohibit the use of closed or solitary confinement or any other punishment that may compromise the physical or mental health of a child.  Human Rights Watch was particularly troubled by the military police's actions in response to a disturbance on April 5 and 6, 2002, in the Espaço Recomeço detention center in Pará. After a small group of youths set fire to their mattresses and attempted to escape, the center called in military police shock troops, who fired tear gas and rubber bullets to quell the disturbance. One youth told Human Rights Watch that military police aimed tear gas canisters directly at him; he had burns, blisters, bruises, and cuts over his face, neck, abdomen, arms, and legs. Other youths reported that police officers beat them with rubber batons and tree branches after they were detained.  Children also suffer violence at the hands of other youths. When Human Rights Watch interviewed Josefina S., held in the state of Amapá, she bore fresh cuts on her face, neck, and arms that she attributed to a fight with another girl.  Physical abuse is not the only human rights violation children suffer in detention. Upon entering a detention facility, children are routinely confined to their cells for five days or more with no opportunity for exercise or other activity.  Cell confinement is also used as the primary formal disciplinary measure. Human Rights Watch found that most detention centers have no clear standards or procedures for the use of cell confinement as a disciplinary measure, and there appear to be no limits on the length of time that children may be confined to their cells.  The majority of youth in detention have only completed between one and four years of primary education. Many are illiterate. Access to schooling would be particularly beneficial for these youth. But many youths do not receive an education while they are in detention, in violation of the Brazilian constitution and international law. In particular, youths who were confined to their cells frequently reported that they could not attend classes.  Most detention centers fail to investigate complaints of abuses. Officials in Manaus, capital of the state of Amazônas, were the only ones to raise the issue of abuses by guards and military police and discuss it forthrightly with Human Rights Watch.

Powell and U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld today. Families who have been expelled from their homes, particularly from the areas around Kirkuk in northern Iraq, will also need to rely on government records to establish their property claims, ethnic identities and place of origin. Failing to protect Iraqi security archives could contribute to retaliatory violence and vengeance killings, since the archives could identify tens of thousands of security agents and collaborators by name, Human Rights Watch said. Looting has been reported in many Iraqi cities as the government collapses, and U.S. and coalition forces have done little to stop it. In Basra, British officials have publicly stated that they allowed the looting of Ba'ath party buildings, which house important archives, as a means of showing the population that the party had lost control of the city. """"These government documents are critical evidence of twenty-five years of atrocities,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Countless families in Iraq will need access to these archives to establish what happened to their missing relatives."""" Human Rights Watch estimates that some 250,000 to 290,000 Iraqis have """"disappeared"""" during the rule of the Ba'ath Party-taken away from their homes by the Iraqi security forces, and never heard from again. The archives of the Iraqi security services could finally allow the families of those """"disappeared"""" to find out what has happened to their long-lost relatives. Following the 1991 uprisings, Kurdish officials secured an estimated 18 tons of Iraqi state documents, which were transferred to the United States and analyzed by Human Rights Watch. These captured documents clearly established Iraqi government responsibility for the genocidal Anfal campaign against the Kurds, and helped Human Rights Watch identify the responsible Iraqi officials. The documents also provided important evidence of other repressive actions by the Iraqi government, including its campaign against the southern Marsh Arab population. Future insecurity could be prevented if documents are preserved. For many displaced Iraqis, official government records are all they have to establish their identities, place of birth, ethnicity, or ownership of property. Human Rights Watch has reported on the confiscation of nationality correction forms, expulsion orders, and ration cards before Iraqis were forcibly displaced from their homes , making the copies available in official government repositories even more important. Current occupants of property abandoned by displaced people have an interest in seeing these documents destroyed. More generally, if these records are not preserved, displaced people will not be able to make property claims, or even to establish their identities or those of their children. In the former Yugoslavia, many property documents were willfully destroyed in the process of """"ethnic cleansing,"""" and displaced people have had great difficulty in returning to their former homes as a result.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

Since March 13, 2003, clashes between the Ijaw and Itsekiri ethnic groups in the Niger delta have claimed scores of lives. Human Rights Watch has received reports of government security forces firing indiscriminately on Ijaw villages, resulting in dozens of deaths. The personnel of oil companies operating around Warri have also been victims of the violence and some companies have helped evacuate community members from the area.  Human Rights Watch appealed to the main companies operating in the area - ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell and TotalFinalElf - to publicly urge the Nigerian government to restore security in a manner that respects due process and fundamental human rights, and that is not disproportionate to the threat.

""""If they make public statements in favor of respecting human rights, the oil companies can help save lives in this very tense situation.""""  All three companies had shut down their operations, saying they would not resume until the situation was more secure. Royal Dutch/Shell and ChevronTexaco resumed limited operations recently.  In the latest violence, the majority of the victims are reported to be Itsekiris. In addition, dozens of civilians - principally Ijaws - are reported to have been killed in a combined operation of Nigerian army, navy and police, who were deployed in large numbers after armed Ijaw youths allegedly killed four soldiers.

Now that his dictatorship is crumbling, what is the best way to bring to justice the surviving members of his government who are responsible for these atrocities? The Bush administration has proposed an """"Iraqi-led"""" tribunal. It sounds wonderful in theory: Why not entrust the Iraqi people with pursuing the crimes committed against them? The Bush administration has proposed an """"Iraqi-led"""" tribunal. It sounds wonderful in theory: Why not entrust the Iraqi people with pursuing the crimes committed against them? In practice, though, Washington proposes to handpick the Iraqis from among its closest exile and opposition friends. This threatens to aggravate political tensions and undermine the rule of law. Only an internationally-led tribunal will have the independence, credibility, and legitimacy needed to see justice done. At stake are not Iraq's alleged crimes against U.S. forces, such as executing prisoners of war or attacking troops while pretending to surrender. If the Pentagon can provide evidence of these crimes, no one would quarrel with its right to prosecute the perpetrators on its own. But these offences pale in comparison with the atrocities that Saddam Hussein and his government committed against the Iraqi people: the so-called Anfal genocide of 1988 in which some 100,000 Kurdish men and boys were rounded up and executed, and entire Kurdish villages assaulted with chemical weapons; the suppression of the 1991 uprisings in the largely Kurdish north and Shia south; and the suppression of the Marsh Arabs in the mid-1990s. In an ideal world, one would hand the prosecution of these atrocities to Iraqi judges and prosecutors. But there are only two potential sources of Iraqi jurists, and neither is promising. The first, judges and prosecutors who populated Saddam Hussein's brutal and arbitrary justice system, is hardly a source of independent, fair-minded professionals. The second comprises Iraqi jurists in exile, as well as Iraqis from communities historically repressed by the Baath Party who remained in the country. It will be an uphill battle for these people to show they are not so consumed by hatred of the former dictatorship they won't simply assume the guilt of the accused. Moreover, Washington's designees would likely be seen as puppets of Washington, rather than independent dispensers of justice. A more prudent route would be to find an internationally-led justice process, modeled after the international tribunals set up for Rwanda and former Yugoslavia, perhaps in streamlined form. To facilitate Iraqi involvement, one could emulate the special court for Sierra Leone, which is dominated by international judges but has significant involvement of local jurists. To decide on which format, and to begin preserving and assembling evidence, the United Nations could establish an international commission of inquiry. An internationally-run court is far more likely than an Iraqi-led tribunal to be seen as a step toward the rule of law rather than a continuation of arbitrary violence. This is essential in a country where, after decades of brutal dictatorship, there is an enormous temptation to summary score-settling. So why does the Bush administration press for a tribunal led by hand-picked Iraqis? First, Washington wants to control the scope of the inquiry to prevent examination of U.S. conduct in Iraq. The Pentagon seems to have gone to great pains to avoid civilian casualties in most cases, but certain of its actions have been controversial under the laws of war, such as the use of cluster bombs, the targeting of civilian morale, and the way in which it has used lethal force in urban areas. The last thing the Pentagon wants is for an independent tribunal to examine its behaviour. Second, the Bush administration wants to apply the death penalty in Iraq. Most democracies have abolished capital punishment, and international tribunals don't permit it. But Washington doesn't want to be denied the option. Finally, and perhaps most important, the Bush administration and the Pentagon detest international justice. Their ideological antipathy toward the International Criminal Court (out of fear that it might focus on an American) has led to its presumptive dislike of any international tribunal. None of these reasons speak to the needs of the Iraqi people, who deserve a fair accounting of the many cruelties they have endured, a credible process for bringing those responsible to justice, and a positive precedent for building the rule of law in their lawless state. An internationally-led judicial process is the Iraqi people's best bet for a more lawful and just future.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

Human Rights Watch urged the new Dutch government being formed to prioritize reforms to bring asylum policy back in line with international standards.  The 33-page report, """"Fleeting Refuge: The Triumph of Efficiency Over Protection in Dutch Asylum Policy,"""" raises concern about recent policies adopted to hasten the processing of asylum claims at the expense of the protection needs of refugees.  """"In its efforts to control immigration, the Dutch government cannot violate fundamental rights,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"The new government in formation should prioritize asylum reform and return the Netherlands to its traditional role as a leader in the defense of human rights and refugee protection in Europe.""""  The Human Rights Watch report is based on three months of research involving review of dozens of transcripts and decisions in asylum cases and extensive interviews with asylum lawyers, humanitarian and human rights organizations, and representatives of the Dutch immigration agency. The report highlights Human Rights Watch concerns in three areas: violations of the right to seek asylum in a routinely-used accelerated determination procedure; the improper treatment of migrant children; and restrictions on asylum seekers' rights to basic material support, including food and adequate housing.  Human Rights Watch reports that the Dutch accelerated """"AC Procedure"""" is being used to process cases for which it is inappropriate. The 48-hour procedure was originally designed to screen out clearly unfounded cases, but is now used to process 60 percent of asylum claims, with government officials aiming to process 80 percent through this accelerated review.  Human Rights Watch said the process gives applicants little opportunity to document their need for protection, receive meaningful advice from a lawyer, or effectively challenge a negative decision on appeal. Particularly for cases involving humanitarian concerns or complex legal or factual questions, Human Rights Watch said the AC procedures are inadequate.  """"The accelerated determination procedures are regularly used to assess the claims of people suffering trauma or fleeing countries torn by war or repression,"""" said Andersen. """"Under these circumstances, the authorities run a very real risk of sending people back to face persecution.""""  The Human Rights Watch report also charges that certain aspects of Dutch immigration policy fail to serve the best interests of migrant children as required under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Specifically, Human Rights Watch expressed concern that more than 30 percent of child asylum seekers have their claims reviewed in the cursory AC procedure.  Human Rights Watch found that interviews of children are often conducted in a manner inappropriate for their age and maturity and without the benefit of consistent assistance from a lawyer or guardian. Human Rights Watch also concluded that Dutch government determinations that a child is """"accompanied"""" by a relative in the Netherlands do not sufficiently assess whether those relatives are willing or able to provide children with long-term care.  In a third area of concern, Human Rights Watch criticized Dutch policy to deny basic material support, including food and housing, to asylum seekers still in various stages of the asylum process. Human Rights Watch says this policy leaves asylum seekers, including families with children, homeless and dependent on charity for basic survival while awaiting a final determination on appeal from the AC procedure. In one case reported by Human Rights Watch, a family from Rwanda was evicted from the asylum reception center after the immigration authorities rejected their asylum claim. When a court later overturned that decision, the family could not be found.  """"People seeking asylum cannot do so effectively if they are worried about where they and their families will sleep,"""" said Andersen. """"Policies that deny basic assistance to those in need are inconsistent with the Netherlands' humanitarian tradition.""""

Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about reports of widespread looting and lawlessness in areas outside of Iraqi government control. Human Rights Watch is also concerned about the potential for violent reprisals by Iraqi civilians against those suspected of supporting the government of Saddam Hussein.  """"The responsibility of U.S. and coalition forces doesn't end when they defeat opposing troops,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Occupying forces are responsible for protecting civilians, not just during combat but in the aftermath of fighting.""""  Press accounts from Basra and other communities in southern Iraq speak of banditry and looting of government buildings and other institutions such as hotels, universities and hospitals. In some cities, civilians have been ransacking government offices and removing important documents related to the government's security apparatus. Such documents are crucial for establishing accountability for human rights violations in Iraq. Documents procured by Human Rights Watch after the 1991 war were instrumental in establishing the details of the Anfal campaign against Iraq's Kurds and the role of Ali Hassan al-Majid, also known as """"Chemical Ali,"""" in conducting that campaign on behalf of the Iraqi government.  U.S. and U.K. forces have at times stood by as the looting has occurred. In Basra, for instance, Britain has publicly stated that it allowed looting of Ba'ath party buildings as a means of showing that the party had lost control of the city. Civilians in Qalat Sukkar, 150 miles southeast of Baghdad, asked U.S. forces to provide security from armed groups plaguing them in the absence of regular Iraqi police officers who disappeared when the city fell to American forces, the New York Times reported on April 8.  Under international humanitarian law, military commanders must prevent and where necessary suppress serious violations involving the local population under their control or subject to their authority. Furthermore, occupying forces have an immediate duty to take all feasible steps to prevent acts of violent reprisal.  The responsibility for protecting civilians extends to the conduct of any local Iraqi armed groups acting under authority of or in conjunction with U.S. forces. That duty exists for the benefit of individuals allied with the Iraqi government who have laid down their arms as well as opponents of the government. Human Rights Watch has outlined these duties previously in a policy paper (International Humanitarian Law Issues In A Potential War In Iraq) and a letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and other U.S. allies (Letter to US and Allies Regarding Adherance to Laws of War).  Based on conduct during the 1991 uprising following the conclusion of the war over Kuwait, when brutal reprisals took place against those suspected of supporting the Iraqi government, Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned about the possibility of mass retaliatory violence and lawlessness in the Shi'a heartland, including the cities of Basra, Najaf and Karbala. Human Rights Watch has also highlighted the northern city of Kirkuk as a potential flashpoint, in anticipation of the return of more than 100,000 ethnic Kurds who had been forcefully expelled by the Iraqi government (Iraq: Impending Inter-Ethnic Violence in Kirkuk).

Reports from the field suggest that Lendu militias, who may have been supported by Ugandan soldiers, attacked remnants of the recently ousted Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) Hema forces. The operation degenerated into a killing spree targeting primarily Hema, and hundreds were reportedly killed.

According to numerous reports from local non-governmental organizations, media, and other sources, since March 13, 2003, clashes around Warri have resulted in the deaths of scores of people and the destruction of dozens of villages. The victims have included members of the Ijaw and Itsekiri communities, and at least twelve members of the government security forces. We offer our sympathy for the victims of the violence, including those among your employees and contractors.   Human Rights Watch is also calling on the Nigerian government to bring the perpetrators of the violence to justice and to take immediate measures to prevent a further deterioration of the situation.   Human Rights Watch recognizes that companies should take all reasonable measures to protect their employees and facilities and understands the need for adequate guarantees of security from the government before resuming operations in and around Warri. We commend the positive role companies have played in sheltering local community members and helping to evacuate them as conditions permit. We also believe that companies such as ChevronTexaco and TotalFinaElf should take measures to avoid future violence and promote respect for human rights.   We are extremely concerned by the response of the government security forces that have been sent to restore law and order. There are already troubling reports of indiscriminate reprisal attacks by the combined operation of Nigerian army, navy and police deployed in large numbers to the area. In addition to those killed in inter-communal clashes, dozens of people are reported to have been killed as the security forces fired at several villages. The information available to us indicates that the Ijaw community of Okerenkoko as a whole, including unarmed civilians, has been targeted in reprisal for the death of four soldiers on March 13, which the military has reportedly attributed to armed youths from Okerenkoko. The security forces have been able to act freely as they have sealed off the area, and it has become virtually impossible for human rights investigators, journalists and other independent witnesses to access the affected villages. While the victims of the military operation have been mostly Ijaws, the majority of those killed in the ongoing inter-communal conflict are reported to have been Itsekiris.   In the past, similar military operations sent to quell civil unrest in the Niger Delta (and elsewhere) have led to widespread extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations, especially in cases where the security forces were acting in reprisal for the killing of their colleagues. For example, in November 1999, security forces killed hundreds of people in an assault on the community of Odi, in Bayelsa State, after twelve policemen had been killed by an armed gang. Soldiers, naval personnel, and paramilitary Mobile Police deployed across the delta carried out summary executions, assaults and other abuses. Perhaps as many as 2,000 people were killed by the army in this operation, described by a presidential spokesman as """"a carefully planned and cautiously executed exercise to rid the society of these criminals."""" A similar operation took place in the central state of Benue, in October 2001, in which more than two hundred people were killed by the army following the murder of nineteen soldiers. At this writing, none of the individuals responsible for the killings in Odi or Benue have been brought to justice.   Now that the government has deployed its security forces in the Warri area, we strongly encourage companies such as ChevronTexaco, Royal Dutch/Shell, and TotalFinaElf to publicly state that the response of government security forces must not be disproportionate to the threat; that they should only resort to force as absolutely necessary in accordance with international standards; that their operation should be conducted in a manner that ensures respect for due process and fundamental human rights; is focused on arresting and prosecuting the actual perpetrators rather than retaliating against whole communities; and any allegations of human rights violations should be thoroughly and impartially investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice. Such a statement would be consistent with the commitments the company has made under the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights in the Extractive Industries, that state """"In their consultations with host governments, Companies should take all appropriate measures to promote observance of applicable international law enforcement principles""""; urge investigations of violations; and """"actively monitor the status of investigations and press for their proper resolution.""""   These public steps would demonstrate to the government, the Nigerian public, and the international community, the company's commitment to human rights and could help to prevent further violations in response to current unrest. We also appeal to you to continue raising these issues with the Nigerian authorities and security forces over the coming period, as tensions are likely to increase in the run-up to the forthcoming elections in Nigeria. We are also communicating our concerns to the Nigerian government and pressing them directly to act with restraint and respect human rights as they respond to the tension around Warri.

Human Rights Watch urged the Serbian government to immediately open the detention facilities to independent observers and to lift the ban on contact between detainees and their lawyers and families. Human Rights Watch said that the government should also abandon a new draft law that would introduce long-term incommunicado detention even in situations other than the state of emergency.  The Human Rights Watch call came on the heels of Serbia and Montenegro’s April 3 accession to the Council of Europe, the principal regional intergovernmental organization committed to upholding respect for human rights.  “The extended incommunicado detention of suspects violates Council of Europe norms,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “Entry into the Council of Europe entails more than a ceremony in Strasbourg. It must include concrete steps to abide by Council standards.” Serbia introduced the state of emergency on March 12, following the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic. Under the state of emergency order, the police can detain anyone who “endangers security of other citizens of the Republic” for up to thirty days, without access to a lawyer, family members, or judicial review of the detention order. More than 2000 individuals are currently detained under the March 12 order. In a letter to the new Prime Minister, Zoran Zivkovic, on March 25, Human Rights Watch urged the government to modify the regime of complete and protracted isolation of detainees, including by allowing independent outside monitors. As of the beginning of April, Human Rights Watch was unaware of any independent organization allowed access to the detainees. On Friday, April 4, a senior Serbian police official stated that “observers from Europe” had visited Belgrade Central Prison, where the majority of those detained under the state of emergency are being held. Officials in the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Justice contacted by Human Rights Watch could not confirm that any such visits had occurred. Under international law, any measure derogating from human rights must be limited to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. International jurists share the view that even in times of emergency no person should be held in isolation without communication with family or a lawyer for longer than a few days. The authorities in Serbia appear to be firmly in control of the security situation and have reportedly detained all but a handful of those suspected of involvement in the assassination of Zoran Djindjic. Under such circumstances, the absolute and continued isolation of the detainees is disproportionate to any possible threat to Serbia’s stability, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch reiterated that outside monitoring of the status of the detainees would be an important check against possible torture or ill-treatment. Detainees who confess to a crime under threat of torture or ill-treatment can subsequently argue at trial that a confession extracted under such circumstances should not be considered by the court. Trials of those currently in detention should be open to the public, except when pressing reasons of public order or of the protection of witnesses require otherwise, Human Rights Watch said. Qualified observers should also be able to attend closed sessions, in line with the recent practice in domestic war crimes trials in the former Yugoslavia.  Serbian officials have argued that the state of emergency does not infringe human rights, as it is directed only against the “criminals.”  “Even under a state of emergency, all people enjoy certain fundamental rights protections, such as the prohibition against torture, and these must be respected,” Andersen said. Human Rights Watch is concerned by the Serbian government’s adoption on April 3 of a draft law authorizing the police to detain anyone suspected of involvement in organized crime for up to sixty days. This law would also apply in situations other than the state of emergency. Under the draft law, a suspect could be deprived of any contact with lawyers or other persons throughout the entire sixty-day period. The Serbian parliament is expected to act on the draft law this week.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

As secretary general of the Northern Bureau of Iraq's Ba'th Party, al-Majid held authority over all agencies of the state in the Kurdish region from March 1987 to April 1989, including the 1st and 5th Corps of the army, the General Security Directorate, and Military Intelligence. This included the period of the Anfal genocide against the region's Kurdish residents. One of his orders, dated June 20, 1987, directed army commanders """"to carry out special bombardments [a reference to chemical weapon use]...to kill the largest number of persons present in ...prohibited zones."""" Named after a Koranic verse justifying pillage of properties of infidels, the Anfal campaign unfolded as the 1980-1988 Iran/Iraq war was winding down. The Anfal campaign, under al-Majid's command, resulted in the murder and """"disappearance"""" of some 100,000 noncombatants, the use of chemical weapons against noncombatants in dozens of locations, and the near-total destruction of family and community assets, including agricultural and other infrastructure, throughout the rural Kurdish areas. Documents captured from Iraqi intelligence services demonstrate that the mass killings, """"disappearances,"""" forced displacement, and other crimes were carried out in a coherent and highly centralized manner under al-Majid's direct supervision. Ali Hassan al-Majid was subsequently in charge of Iraq's military occupation of Kuwait and led forces that suppressed the popular uprising in the south of the country in March 1991. All of these campaigns were marked by executions, arbitrary arrests, """"disappearances,"""" torture, and other atrocities. According to Iraqi opposition activists and refugee testimony, al-Majid also played a leading role in the campaign against Iraq's Marsh Arab population in the 1990s. Numbering some 250,000 people as recently as 1991, the Marsh Arabs today are believed to number fewer than 40,000 in their ancestral homeland. Many were arrested, """"disappeared,"""" or executed; most have become refugees abroad or are internally displaced in Iraq as a result of al-Majid's campaign. """"Al-Majid represented the worst of the Iraqi government, and that's saying quite a lot,"""" said Roth. """"He was a key figure in the 1988 genocide, and was responsible for other crimes against humanity, too."""" """"Chemical Ali"""" in his own words According to a 1988 audiotape of a meeting of leading Iraqi officials published by Human Rights Watch, al-Majid vowed to use chemical weapons against the Kurds, saying: """"I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! the international community, and those who listen to them! """"I will not attack them with chemicals just one day, but I will continue to attack them with chemicals for fifteen days.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","International Justice"

""""Cuba is flouting fundamental human rights norms.""""  The United Nations Commission on Human Rights, now holding its annual six-week session in Geneva, will be examining the human rights situation in Cuba. Four Latin American countries (Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Peru and Uruguay) have drafted a resolution on Cuba's human rights situation.  Over the past eleven years, the U.N. Commission has passed ten resolutions criticizing Cuba's violations of human rights. The language of this year's resolution is considerably weaker than that of past years, however. Notably, it contains no reference to the nature of the abuses under examination.  """"It's perverse that there's a massive crackdown occurring in Cuba just at the moment that the United Nations is examining Cuba's human rights record,"""" said Vivanco. """"The Commission must condemn these abuses, and do so strongly and unequivocally.""""  Human Rights Watch has confirmed that at least twelve defendants have been sentenced, including Marta Beatriz Roque Cabello, age 56; Raul Rivero, age 57; Hector Palacios, age 62; Nelson Molinet Espino; Nelson Alberto Aguilar Rodríguez; Ricardo González; Oscar Espinosa Chepe; Hector Maseda; Oscar Alfonso Valdes; Marcelo Lopez and Marcelo Cano.  Marta Beatriz Roque, an independent economist, received a twenty-year sentence. Roque had previously spent nearly three years in prison for publishing an analytic paper calling for political reforms.  Nelson Molinet Espino and Nelson Alberto Aguiar, two dissidents who were tried together with Beatriz Roque, received twelve-year sentences.  Raul Rivero, a noted poet, writer and independent journalist, received a twenty-year sentence. Other sentenced journalists include Ricardo González Alfonso, who worked as a correspondent for Reporters Sans Frontières, and who received a twenty-year sentence. Oscar Espinosa Chepe, an economist, and Hector Maseda Gutierrez, a journalist, also received twenty-year sentences.  Opposition leader Hector Palacios, for whom prosecutors had originally recommended a life sentence, was sentenced to twenty-five years of imprisonment for treason and subversion. Palacios is one of the leaders of the Varela Project, a high-profile reformist effort.  Opposition activist Oscar Alfonso Valdes reportedly received an eighteen-year sentence.  Marcelo Lopez and Marcelo Cano, human rights activists, received eighteen and fifteen year sentences, respectively.  The ongoing trials are the latest development in a massive wave of repression that began on March 18. Approximately 80 people have been arrested and detained since the crackdown began, including prominent dissidents, human rights activists, independent journalists, independent unionists, and directors of independent libraries.  State-run television has accused the detainees of """"provocations"""" and """"subversive activities.""""  One of the ongoing trials is that of Oscar Biscet, a doctor and human rights activist. He was arrested in December 2002, prior to the current crackdown. His arrest came just over a month after his release from prison after serving a three-year-sentence for a peaceful protest. Prosecutors are reportedly demanding a life sentence in his case.  The Cuban courts are using extremely summary procedures in these cases. As a general matter, the courts lack independence and fair procedures.

A tribunal composed of Iraqi jurists selected by the United States would not have the capacity to adjudicate the staggering scope of crimes by the Iraqi government, including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.  Iraq's Revolutionary Courts, State Security Courts, and Special Provisional Courts have been instruments of repression rather than impartial judicial institutions, Human Rights Watch said. The Iraqi state has also interfered with other civil and criminal courts.  Meanwhile, scholars, lawyers, and jurists in the Iraqi exile community should not be expected to shoulder the burden of handling a high volume of politically charged prosecutions, Human Rights Watch said.  """"After decades of Ba'ath Party rule, the Iraqi judiciary has been deeply compromised,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/04/06/belgium-anti-atrocity-law-limited","Belgium- Anti-Atrocity Law Limited","Belgium: Anti-Atrocity Law Limited","But Case Against ex-Chad Dictator Can Move Forward","04/06/2003","(Brussels) - Today's vote in the Belgian Parliament to amend Belgium's landmark anti-atrocity law will create political and diplomatic hurdles to the prosecution of many human rights crimes, Human Rights Watch said today. Some key cases which had been stalled, however, including that against Chad's exiled former president, Hissène Habré, will now move forward. The Belgian law, which permits victims to file complaints in Belgium for atrocities committed abroad, has come under attack as a result of a growing number of filings against foreign leaders. The Belgian Supreme Court, in a February decision on a complaint by victims of a 1982 massacre of civilians in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla, upheld the law against legal challenges, while ruling that top sitting state officials, such as Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, enjoyed immunity from Belgian courts. Human rights organizations have long proposed establishing “filters” to prevent frivolous cases and render the law more politically viable. A controversial new provision adopted today, however, goes much further by allowing the government, in cases in which the victim is not Belgian, and where the accused's home state upholds the right of a fair trial, to step in and send the complaint to that state. This provision was pushed through after a complaint was filed on March 19 against former U.S. President George Bush, and other senior figures by the families of Iraqi victims of a U.S. attack on a Baghdad shelter in the 1991 Gulf War which left over 400 persons dead. In practice, said Human Rights Watch, this provision will subject the government to diplomatic pressure when a complaint is filed. “Everyone agrees that Belgium should be a court of last resort for atrocity victims, not a dumping ground for political grievances,” said Reed Brody, Special Counsel with Human Rights Watch. “But today’s amendment opens the door to political and diplomatic negotiations over almost every case that is filed. The government has promised that it would step in only in exceptional cases. We will be holding their feet to the fire to keep that promise.” Human Rights Watch noted that today’s vote ensures that several stalled cases in which there are Belgian victims can now go forward. These include the cases of Belgians killed in Guatemala and Rwanda as well as the case against Chad's exiled former president, Hissène Habré. A Belgian judge and police team visited Chad last year to investigate the charges against Habré who lives in exile in Senegal, where he was indicted three years ago on atrocity charges before the Senegalese courts ruled that he could not be tried there. Senegal is holding Habré pending an extradition request from Belgium and the government of Chad recently told Belgium that it would waive any immunity that Habré might seek to assert. The Habré case is not subject to government intervention because a number of the victims are Belgian and because Chad does not offer the possibility of a fair trial. “It is now clear that the case against Habré can go forward,” said Brody. “We hope that Habré will be indicted soon and then extradited from Senegal to stand trial in Belgium.” Human Rights Watch also called on the government not to dismiss the Sabra and Shatilla case. “There is abundant evidence that crimes against humanity were committed in the massacre of over 700 civilians, but not a single individual has been brought to justice,” said Brody. “Sending the case to Israel is just a recipe for continued impunity.” Under other amendments adopted today, before a victim can file a case directly in the future, there must be some link with Belgium, either because the suspect is on Belgium soil, because the crimes took place in Belgium or because the victim is Belgian or has lived in Belgium for three years. If there is no such link, the victim can take the case to the state prosecutor who must bring the case unless it appears unfounded or unless an international court or the courts where the crimes took place or of the suspect’s home state offer a fair, independent and more effective avenue to justice. The victims can appeal the prosecutor’s decision not to act. Background to the Belgian Law A 1993 law gives Belgian courts the authority to hear criminal complaints by victims accusing officials of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes abroad, regardless of where the crimes took place, whether the suspect or the victims are Belgian and whether the accused is in Belgium. The Belgian law puts into practice the international law principle of “universal jurisdiction"""" which holds that every state has an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of particular crimes of international concern. Prosecutions based on universal jurisdiction are an essential part of the emerging system of international justice. They help to break down the wall of immunity with which tyrants and torturers protect themselves in their own countries. There has been one trial thus far under the Belgian law. Four Rwandans were convicted in June 2001 by a Belgian jury on charges of involvement in the 1994 genocide in their country. As in most French-inspired civil law countries, Belgium gives victims the right to file a complaint directly before an investigating judge (juge d'instruction). Cases have been filed in Belgium against Mauritanian President Maaouya ould Sid'Ahmed Taya, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, Cuban President Fidel Castro, Central African Republic President Ange-Felix Patassé, Republic of Congo President, Denis Sassou Nguesso, Palestinian Authority President Yassir Arafat, former Chadian President Hissène Habré, former Chilean President Gen. Augusto Pinochet, former Iranian president Hashemi Rafsanjani former Moroccan interior minister Driss Basri, former Foreign Minister Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, among others. Many of these cases have not been actively pursued, however. The case of Laurent Gbagbo has been dismissed. In addition, the cases against sitting officials will not go forward in light the ruling in the Sharon case that top state officials enjoy immunity while in office. The establishment of a permanent International Criminal Court (ICC) may also relieve some pressure on Belgium. The ICC has jurisdiction over cases of genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity when national courts are unable or unwilling to prosecute. The ICC, however, will be prospective only - addressing crimes committed after its statute went into effect on July 1, 2002. In addition, the ICC suffers from a jurisdictional regime which requires that, in the absence of a Security Council referral, either the state on whose territory the crimes were committed or the state of nationality of the accused be a party to the statute or consent to jurisdiction. As the state of territory and nationality will often in practice be one and the same state, and that state may well not be a state party, many future atrocities may be outside of the court’s reach.","Africa, Chad, Europe/Central Asia, Belgium",""

According to numerous reports from local non-governmental organizations, media, and other sources, since March 13, 2003, clashes around Warri have resulted in the deaths of scores of people and the destructions of dozens of villages. The victims have included members of the Ijaw and Itsekiri communities, as well as members of the security forces. We are appealing to you to ensure that the perpetrators of the violence are brought to justice and to take immediate measures to prevent a further deterioration of the situation, especially as tensions are likely to rise in the run-up to forthcoming elections.  We are particularly concerned about the response of the security forces that have been sent to restore law and order over the last two weeks. We are receiving troubling reports of indiscriminate reprisal attacks by the combined operation of Nigerian army, navy and police deployed in large numbers to the area. In addition to those killed in inter-communal clashes, dozens of people are reported to have been killed as the security forces fired at several villages. The information available to us indicates that the Ijaw community of Okerenkoko as a whole, including unarmed civilians, has been targeted in reprisal for the death of four soldiers on March 13, which the military have reportedly attributed to armed youths from Okerenkoko. The security forces have been able to act freely as they have sealed off the area, and it has become virtually impossible for human rights investigators, journalists and other independent witnesses to access the affected villages. While the victims of the military operation have been mostly Ijaws, the majority of those killed in the inter-communal conflict are reported to have been Itsekiris. Human Rights Watch strongly condemns the killing of the soldiers on March 13 and in other incidents and urges that those responsible be brought to justice. However, the death of these soldiers does not justify indiscriminate reprisal attacks against an entire community; it is likely that many of the people currently targeted by the military operation were not involved in any way in the attacks on soldiers.  Human Rights Watch has documented several instances in the past where similar military operations sent to quell civil unrest in the Niger delta (and elsewhere) have led to widespread extrajudicial killings and other human rights violations, especially in cases where the security forces were acting in reprisal for the killing of their colleagues. We have raised some of these cases with your government before, and we regret that to date, there has been little or no action to prosecute those responsible. For example, in November 1999, soldiers, naval personnel and paramilitary Mobile Police killed hundreds of people, perhaps as many as 2,000, in an assault on the community of Odi, in Bayelsa State, after twelve policemen were killed by an armed gang. In a similar operation in Benue State, in October 2001, more than two hundred people were killed by the army following the murder of nineteen soldiers. Human Rights Watch has documented the events in both Odi and Benue in detail in previous reports. At this writing, none of the individuals responsible for the killings in Odi or Benue have been brought to justice.  Now that the government has deployed its security forces in the Warri area, we urge you to ensure that their response is not disproportionate to the threat; that they only resort to force as absolutely necessary in accordance with international standards; that their operation is conducted in a manner that ensures respect for due process and fundamental human rights; that it is focused on arresting and prosecuting the actual perpetrators rather than retaliating against an entire community; and that any allegations of human rights violations are thoroughly and impartially investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.

The U.N. Special Rapporteur on torture presented his report on Uzbekistan during a special NGO briefing at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva today. The report, based on the Special Rapporteur’s mission to Uzbekistan in late 2002, found torture in Uzbekistan “systematic” and listed numerous measures the government must take to stop it.  At the same session, Human Rights Watch presented a 12-page briefing paper documenting torture-related deaths in Uzbekistan caused by prolonged beatings, suffocation, and other methods.  “For years, the Uzbek government has rarely held torturers accountable, even when they killed their victims,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “The government should implement the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations now to end impunity for torture.”  The Human Rights Watch briefing paper describes eight suspicious deaths in custody apparently resulting from torture that occurred over the past fifteen months. The paper also cites thirteen cases in which authorities contributed to the deaths of ill prisoners by beating them, holding them in extraordinarily harsh conditions, or denying them food parcels and medical treatment. In all twenty-one cases, the Uzbek authorities either refused to investigate the death or provided improbable conclusions after inadequate investigations, and failed to bring the perpetrators to justice or compensate the families.  In its briefing paper, Human Rights Watch emphasized several of the Special Rapporteur’s recommendations that the Uzbek government should implement as a matter of priority, including:  Introducing judicial review of detention into Uzbek law; holding accountable those responsible for torture, in conformity with relevant U.N. standards; compensation for torture victims and, where relevant, their families; ensuring evidence obtained by torture is not admissible; allowing the United Nations Committee against Torture to receive individual complaints concerning violations of the Convention; and access for independent monitoring organizations to places of detention.Human Rights Watch also urged the U.N. Commission on Human Rights to call on the Uzbek government to implement the recommendations.  “The Uzbek government has claimed that by inviting the Special Rapporteur it has taken an important step toward ending torture and cooperating with the U.N. system,” said Andersen. “But the real test will be in implementing the recommendations. That is the best hope for reducing detainees’ fatal risk of torture.”","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","United Nations"

For the most part, the reports candidly describe human rights abuses committed by U.S. allies in the war on terrorism, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Uzbekistan, China and Russia. One exception is a reference in the reports' introduction to elections in Pakistan producing a """"reasonably representative"""" government. In fact, key moderate parties were banned from standing in the elections for parliament last year.  """"The Bush administration has not pulled many punches in this report,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"But it should also be troubled that some of its closest allies in the war on terrorism engage in repressive practices that fuel support for terrorists.""""  Human Rights Watch pointed out that the State Department reports condemn practices abroad in which the United States itself reportedly engages. For example, the reports condemn as torture so called """"stress and duress"""" interrogation techniques such as sleep deprivation and the shackling of prisoners in painful positions in a number of countries, including Burma, Iran, Egypt, and Eritrea. According to U.S. officials quoted in press accounts, U.S. interrogators have used similar techniques against suspected Al Qaeda detainees in Afghanistan and elsewhere.  The United States has also reportedly transferred custody of terrorist suspects to countries that the State Department reports condemn for torturing prisoners.  """"The Bush administration needs to address this glaring inconsistency,"""" Malinowski said. """"Its moral clarity will mean little if it doesn't rebuild its moral authority.""""  Comments on specific country chapters of the State Department reports follow:  Afghanistan: The report rightly calls attention to violent assaults on nongovernmental and humanitarian organizations, the lack of progress towards accountability for past abuses, continued attacks on ethnic Pashtuns, and the reappearance of the religious police who enforce restrictions on public conduct and dress. Nevertheless, the report overstates human rights progress since the fall of the Taliban. For example, the authority and effectiveness of the Karzai government is exaggerated, and human rights abuses leading up to last year's Loya Jirga meeting are downplayed. References to """"regional commanders"""" or """"rogue warlords"""" are carefully couched in language that doesn't convey their dominant role in the country. Grave abuses against Afghan women, in the western province of Herat and elsewhere, are mentioned, but these reports are usually attributed to other sources in a way that leaves unclear whether the U.S. government believes them. In Geneva, at the UN Commission on Human Rights, a draft resolution on Afghanistan is under consideration, but the US is strongly opposing any reference to a UN recommendation for a mechanism to catalogue abuses committed by all parties since 1978.  China: The report candidly describes China's overall human rights record. Commendably, it criticizes China for misusing the war on terrorism to justify a crackdown against Uighur separatists and peaceful religious leaders. It is more detailed and critical than past reports on China's restrictions on the Internet, and is more skeptical than past reports about China's progress on legal reform. It includes a strong section on abuses of religious freedom, and good analysis of economic dislocation and protests by unemployed workers. At the same time, the report gives credit to China for issuing invitations, without conditions, to U.N. human rights experts, even though no such visits have yet been scheduled. It does not adequately address the lack of freedom of association and expression for AIDS activists and journalists reporting on the epidemic. And it overplays progress in Tibet, crediting China for early releases of dissidents, although many had served all but a few months of their terms - and none should have been sentenced in the first place. Moreover, on the basis of this overwhelmingly damning report, the United States should have introduced weeks ago a resolution on China at the U.N. Human Rights Commission and launched a diplomatic campaign to promote it.  Colombia: The State Department must by law certify twice each year whether Colombia is cutting ties to paramilitary groups to maintain full funding for military aid to the country. This year's report acknowledges that members of Colombia's armed forces and police continued to commit serious human rights abuses, in particular through continuing links to illegal paramilitary groups. However, throughout the report and despite abundant evidence of these links, this alliance is minimized by language that reduces the phenomenon to isolated units and individual officers. The report also overplays a decline in massacres attributed to paramilitary groups. In fact, this decline is a result of a tactical decision by the paramilitary leadership, currently engaged in negotiations with the government, and not of effective measures by the government to arrest and prosecute paramilitary leaders. Finally, the report makes an unfortunate attempt to defend the work of Colombia's Attorney General, who has systematically undermined and derailed many of the key human rights cases mentioned in the report.  Kazakhstan: By law the State Department must certify that Kazakhstan is making progress on human rights to continue assistance to its government. This year's report accurately concludes that the Kazakhstan government's already poor human rights record """"worsened"""" in 2002.  Nigeria: The report discusses abuses committed by police, army and security forces as well as vigilante groups including the Bakassi Boys in Abia and Anambra states and the O'odua People's Congress (OPC) in the southwest. It also notes human rights abuses by the police against the OPC and other groups. Armed groups were also used by politicians and their supporters to carry out violence and intimidation against political opponents, and the report correctly states that serious violence occurred during the local primaries of the ruling People's Democratic Party (PDP). It notes that a commission of inquiry was set up to investigate clashes in Benue and neighboring states, including the killing of over two hundred civilians by the military in Benue State in October 2001. However, it fails to stress that no action has been taken against the members of the Nigerian armed forces who took part in these killings. The U.S. Congress has since suspended Nigerian participation in U.S. military training programs under International Military Education and Training (IMET) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF) until the Bush administration submits a report to Congress about whether members of the armed forces responsible for taking part in the massacres in Benue are being suspended from service and what steps are being taken to bring them to justice.  Pakistan: In general, the report paints a sobering picture of the way the Musharraf government hijacked democracy and boosted the military's power through a referendum, rigged elections, and constitutional amendments. It highlights an increase of sectarian attacks on Christians, continuing abuses suffered by women, government controls of the media, and wide-scale detentions of political opponents and activists. However, the introduction of the report inexplicably claims that the government elected in what it concedes were rigged elections was """"reasonably representative."""" The report is also weak in its description of Pakistan's Anti Terrorist Act, amended in 2001 and strengthened last November by Musharraf, and of the country's anti-terrorist courts. This highlights how U.S. policy towards Pakistan has increasingly become driven by cooperation in the war against terrorism, which has muted U.S. efforts to promote democratic change and basic human rights.  Uzbekistan: The State Department by law must certify that Uzbekistan is making progress on human rights to continue assistance to its government. The report offers scant evidence of progress. It paints a straightforward picture of the arrest and brutal treatment of human rights defenders in Uzbekistan, and the virtually complete absence of political and media freedoms. It acknowledges that more than 6,000 people remain in prison in the country for political and religious reasons and that prisoners are routinely subject to torture. And it describes how prosecutors in Uzbekistan's courtrooms are able to dictate proceedings and, almost always, obtain guilty verdicts. At the same time, the report consistently refers to non-violent religious prisoners, the victims of a merciless campaign of religious persecution, as """"suspected Islamic extremists"""" or people suspected of having """"extremist Islamic political sympathies,"""" terms that the Uzbek government could read as justifying its policy of arresting and torturing members of unregistered religious groups. The report also incorrectly claims that the Uzbek government """"permitted the existence of opposition political parties."""" In fact, no genuine opposition party is permitted to function. Discussion of Uzbekistan's highly restrictive religion law focused disproportionately on how it affected small Christian groups.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo"

Many of the 26 soldiers interviewed by Human Rights Watch in recent days spoke of extremely low pay and meager food rations in their units. Some said they had chosen to desert now because their units were beginning to retreat farther from Kurdish-controlled territory in anticipation of a joint U.S.-Kurdish advance from the north.  The Human Rights Watch interviews are the first independent, substantial information about Iraqi army deserters since the war began.  One Iraqi soldier gave an eyewitness account of the summary execution of ten suspected deserters. Others said they knew of execution squads of 10-12 men drawn from regular armed forces and from Military Intelligence, but they had not witnessed any executions themselves.  Human Rights Watch estimates that there were as many as 130 Iraqi deserters in the custody of the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) in Arbil province as of April 2. The total number of Iraqi deserters in Kurdish-held areas could not be ascertained. The Iraqi soldiers all reported good treatment by the Kurdish forces to whom they had surrendered. Most of them had been registered by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  All of the deserters interviewed by Human Rights Watch were men, regular soldiers between the ages of 20 and 38. They looked gaunt and several suffered from skin ailments as a result of the conditions on the battlefield. They spoke of low pay (approximately US$2 a month) or going for months without any pay.  “Some days were so hungry we would eat grass which we mixed with a little water,” said a 21-year-old soldier from Baghdad whose unit was part of the Fifth Corps. “We didn’t wash ourselves for forty days. Often there was no drinking water and they would give us jerry cans and tell us to go and fill them from the pools of water that gathered on the ground when it rained.”  Some of the Iraqi soldiers described inhumane punishments including being beaten, or being forced to crawl across stones on their bare knees or backs. One showed the scars on his back from this punishment. Their officers frequently warned them that they would be executed if they tried to escape. Several deserters said their officers forced them to remain in their positions during the air strikes, telling them “to die like men.”  The eyewitness to an execution said that on March 26, ten deserters were brought to an open field where a colonel had gathered other units to witness the execution. “This is what happens to betrayers of our nation,” the colonel told the assembled troops, according to the witness. He then began shooting the alleged deserters one by one; other members of the execution squad joined in. The colonel then ordered the bodies to be dragged up onto a hillside so the soldiers would have a better view of the corpses.  Most of the deserters interviewed by Human Rights Watch said they were taken to a school near the Armed Forces Command in Arbil where Pesh Merga, or Kurdish fighters, questioned them. Several said they were interrogated by U.S. military. The desertions fit a general pattern. Iraqi deserters tend to leave their units at night or at dawn—sometimes alone, but more often in groups of five or six. After approaching shepherds or walking into Kurdish villages, they then go to a Pesh Merga checkpoint where they are questioned, given food, and sent on to Arbil. All of the detainees interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that they had been treated well by the Kurdish Pesh Merga—from the frontline to the camp. Many stated that they were surprised at how welcoming the Pesh Merga were, especially as they had been told by their officers that Kurdish forces would kill them if they surrendered. Human Rights Watch interviewed some of the detainees in a school near the KDP’s Armed Forces Command Headquarters outside of Arbil on March 31. Others were interviewed April 2 in the Ashkawtian camp for “war detainees” in Merga Sur, about two-and-a-half hours’ drive northeast of Arbil, close to the border with Turkey. Once 20 or more deserters have been brought to the school, they are transported to the camp.  Approximately 88 tents had been erected at the Merga Sur camp, and about 20 of those were occupied. A camp official told Human Rights Watch that he hoped to have enough tents and supplies to eventually hold 7,000 detainees. A doctor comes to the camp every day to check on detainees in need of medical care. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is distributing clothes; the World Food Program is supplying food and cooking utensils.  The camp is not heavily guarded. Detainees wander around freely and some appear to be helping to erect sanitary facilities and other amenities. Those detainees who had arrived two days earlier had ICRC registration cards. Many detainees said that they wanted to have radios and satellite television in order to follow the war. The camp director said he is trying to get these items.  The camp detainees are fearful of what has happened to their families in Iraq since they surrendered. “I worry most about my pregnant wife,” said a 26-year-old soldier from Baghdad whose unit was part of the Iraqi army’s Fourth Corps. “I haven’t seen her for four months now. We live near a large army base in Baghdad and I am sure the Americans have bombed it. I have no idea if she is alive or dead.”  Case Extracts  Case #1: According to a 28-year-old soldier from al-‘Amara (who deserted on March 26), “I know some my officers would like to desert. But since they are officers and known in the higher ranks, they fear reprisals against their families.”  Case #2: “I never witnessed an execution,” said a 26-year-old soldier from Baghdad whose unit was part of the Iraqi army’s Fourth Corps. “But I heard of them. On the day I escaped our group split up when we reached the river. My group went to the left, while another group of five men went to the right. I learned from deserters who followed me from my unit, that these men were captured near the last Iraqi checkpoint and executed by a Ba’thist captain who was appointed to carry out this task.”  “I worry most about my pregnant wife,” he went on to say. “I haven’t seen her for four months now. We live near a large army base in Baghdad and I am sure the Americans have bombed it. I have no idea if she is alive or dead.”  Case #3: A 30-year-old-soldier said that during the evening of March 27, he and a group of about 30 soldiers from his unit set their weapons aside and fled to a nearby Kurdish village. “An officer and several soldiers pursued us. When we reached the outskirts of the village, they caught up with us and opened fire. Six of us escaped but I don’t know what happened to the others. I haven’t seen any of them here at the camp.”  Case #4: “US bombs were raining down on us,” a twenty-five year old soldier from Mosul said. “It was worst at night. One night some of us tried to leave the ridge where we were based, but our officers ordered us back at gunpoint. The next day we decided to run to the other side.”  Case #5: A 29-year-old soldier from Baghdad whose unit was part of the Iraqi army’s First Corps: “Our unit came under intense bombardment [by US forces]. On March 25 orders came for us to withdraw from our positions to [location withheld]. We were supposed to begin pulling back at four o’clock in the morning. There was no other choice – we had to flee quickly before we were moved further away from the Kurdish frontline. There were six of us. We were afraid because there was talk of execution squads among the soldiers. We heard the officers talking about them too, probably to scare us. We were not allowed to have any radios, but I managed to keep mine. I heard on the news that the Kurds were welcoming soldiers who surrendered. At two o’clock in the morning [on March 26] we crept away unnoticed and walked for four hours until we reached the Kurdish areas. The Pesh Merga welcomed us”.  Case #6: A 19-year-old soldier from al-‘Amara whose unit was part of the Iraqi army’s Fifth Corps: “We fled our unit at five o’clock in the morning on March 24. There were eight of us to begin with but two of them separated from us and I don’t know what happened to them. We walked for eight hours looking for ways to get back home to our families, but some Kurds we came across told us that if we did that we would be executed. So we surrendered to the Pesh Merga instead. We had heard there was an execution squad at the checkpoint on the river near Gwer. Our officers kept threatening us, saying that if we tried to desert we would be executed, and that if they didn’t kill us the Kurds would. We were forbidden to have radios so we didn’t know what was happening, but we thought that if we surrendered to Kurdish forces there was a chance that they would take us prisoner instead…Our living conditions were very hard. We were given soup and tea in the morning, rice for lunch without any sauce or meat, and very often nothing for dinner. Drinking water was filthy. We didn’t even have any tents to sleep in. The officers made us dig ditches in the ground and that is where we slept.”  Case # 7: A 21-year-old soldier from Baghdad whose unit was part of the Iraqi army’s Fifth Corps: “We were hungry most of the time. They gave us one or two pieces of bread every two days and very often the bread was rotten, or else it was very hard but we had to eat something. Some days we were so hungry that we would eat grass which we mixed with a little water. We didn’t wash for about forty days. Often there was no drinking water and they would give us jerry cans and tell us to go and fill them from the pools of water that gathered on the ground when it rained.”  “Three of us escaped together on the night of March 30. We were two conscripts and a deputy officer. At first the [aerial] bombardment on our positions was light. There were no execution squads then, but then we heard that a group from our unit had fled. We decided to go too. At nine o’clock in the evening we crept away and started running. Four other soldiers who were also running away were about one kilometer behind us. Our escape was detected and we were being pursued. We made it but the four behind us didn’t. I heard shots being fired and I think they were killed.”  Case # 8: A 22-year-old soldier from al-Nasiriyya whose unit belonged to the Iraqi army’s Fifth Corps: “Our unit was positioned in [location withheld], not far from Kalak. The bombardment was very intense. A friend of mine died during one of the raids. Those who are wounded are just left there on the ground to die. Three of us planned to escape together on March 31. One of them was a friend of mine and he was really frightened. I tried to force him to come with me but in the end he stayed behind. So two of us slipped away unnoticed and walked for a short while until we reached a Kurdish village. I don’t know what it was called but it was near Kalak. The Pesh Merga received us, and after about three hours they took us to the corps headquarters in Arbil where we saw three other soldiers who had surrendered. We stayed there for two days. Four foreign journalists came to ask us questions but they only filmed us from the back and our heads were covered. We did not give them our names, or details about our units. Then today they brought us to this camp in two Coasters [minibus], each one with 25 soldiers. There were others who fled from our unit before we did. Some of them went back to their families in the south. Those who had higher ranks stayed with the corps. They cannot afford to escape because Military Intelligence has a lot of information about them and can easily reach their families…We are young men but we feel old. We want our life back.

Human Rights Watch estimates that as of April 2, up to 130 Iraqi soldiers had surrendered to the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). The deserters were fleeing U.S. bombardment and ill treatment by their own commanders.  """"Iraqi soldiers who desert their units and flee into Kurdish-controlled areas should be treated as prisoners of war,"""" said Hania Mufti, London Director for the Middle East and North Africa Division. """"They are entitled to the same rights and benefits as Iraqi soldiers taken prisoner by U.S. forces.""""  Iraqi soldiers who attempt to desert to Kurdish-controlled areas have faced Iraqi army execution squads, a violation of international human rights law.  Both Kurdish officials and the U.S. presidential envoy to the Iraqi opposition (the latter in a public statement issued on March 31) have announced an agreement for Kurdish forces to put themselves """"under the command and control of U.S. forces."""" In doing so, Kurdish forces became effectively part of the armed forces of one of the parties to the international armed conflict in Iraq.  Among other obligations derived from this status, Kurdish forces must comply with an internal disciplinary system and observe respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to international armed conflicts. Under international law, ultimate responsibility for the well-being of these prisoners of war (POWs) lies with the detaining power - that is, the central U.S. authorities under whose command the Kurdish forces taking the prisoners have placed themselves.  Iraqi soldiers who fall into the power of their enemy are entitled to the status of prisoners of war and therefore to the benefits and guarantees of the Third Geneva Convention. It is the responsibility of the detaining authorities to ensure these protections. In the case of the Iraqi POWs, many have expressed intense fear of reprisals against their families still in Iraq if their identities are revealed. This makes the duty to protect them from """"public curiosity"""" even more critical.  The guarantees all POWs are entitled to include:  humane treatment at all times; protection from exposure to danger while awaiting evacuation from a fighting zone; not being sent to or detained in a location where they may be exposed to fire from the combat zone; protection from reprisals or collective punishment; protection of their honor; they must not be subject to insults or violence or be made a public curiosity; internment in premises affording basic hygiene and provision of acceptable food, clothing, and shelter. If they are wounded or sick they should be provided with the same medical care that is given to the members of the armed forces of the detaining power; release at the end of hostilities; immunity from prosecution solely for having taken part in the armed conflict. Furthermore, if questioned, POWs are obliged only to give their name and rank, date of birth, and military serial number or equivalent information; they may not be punished for failing to provide other than this narrowly prescribed information.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

Hundreds of thousands of children were orphaned and many now try to cope on their own. Families all over the country have opened their homes to needy children but, themselves living in poverty, they have not always respected foster children's rights.     Some children are exploited as domestic servants in exchange for some food and a place to sleep. Thousands have fled to city streets, only to find themselves harassed and arrested by law enforcement officials.     """"The Rwandan government has repeatedly promised to remedy the human rights problems that many children still suffer, but words are not enough,"""" said Sara Rakita, author of the report. """"These children have already suffered terribly, and they need protection from further abuse.""""     """"Lasting Wounds"""" documents the trauma that many children experienced during the genocide, and that still affects them today. One child recalled spending the night alone in the bush after having fled her home. She told Human Rights Watch, """"There wasn't anyone else, just bodies, lots of bodies.

Of the 53 members of the commission, 24 will be elected for two-year terms by the U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) in late April. Several governments have already announced their candidacy.  """"This year's election already looks like a who's who of the worst human rights abusers,"""" said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director of Human Rights Watch. """"Governments that care about human rights have to act to prevent the Commission from being hijacked.""""  Human Rights Watch advocates minimum criteria for membership in the Commission, such as:  ratification of the main human rights treaties; prompt reporting to U.N. human rights bodies; issuing open invitations to U.N. human rights investigators. Countries should be disqualified from membership if they have been condemned by the Commission for serious human rights violations in the recent past, Human Rights Watch said.  Among the worrisome candidates:  North Korea is bidding for one of six seats assigned to the Asian Group, despite being one of the most repressive and closed regimes in the world; Cuba is among the candidates agreed upon by the Latin American group, despite its severe recent crackdown on dissidents and its refusal to cooperate with numerous resolutions passed by the Commission on Human Rights; Russia is slated for one of two seats open for Eastern Europe, despite its refusal to admit U.N. experts to investigate abuses in Chechnya; Egypt is likely to be put forward by the African group, despite its abysmal record of torture and ill-treatment of detainees, demonstrated only last week in its detention of anti-war demonstrators. Candidates are put forward by the different regional groups. Elections will be held for seven African, six Asian, six Latin American, three Western and two East European seats. In cases where the number of candidates equals the number of the vacant seats, the election will be a formality.  Human Rights Watch called on the five regional groups to remove from their endorsed lists any candidates who have poor human rights records and who fail to cooperate with the Commission. It urged governments with positive human rights credentials to stand for election and help to restore the integrity of the Commission.  Human Rights Watch also warned that many western governments currently serving on the Commission need to lift their own standards. For instance, the United States has not ratified all the key conventions and Australia has refused to cooperate with U.N. treaty bodies. Twenty-one members of the western group have issued standing invitations to U.N. human rights experts.  The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, in his report to the current session of the Commission on Human Rights, also stressed the need for a code of guidelines for membership of the Commission and a code of conduct for members while they serve on the Commission.  Several governments have said they support membership criteria and will apply standards of this kind in considering others for election. In the past three years, at least 45 states have issued standing invitations to the Commission's human rights monitors.  """"No member of the Commission has a perfectly clean record on human rights.

Human Rights Watch also called on the Cuban government to drop all charges against the defendants. The ongoing trials are the latest development in a wave of repression that began on March 18. Approximately 80 people have been arrested and detained since the crackdown began, including prominent dissidents, human rights activists, independent journalists, and directors of independent libraries.  """"The fact that this wave of repression coincides with the war in Iraq is surely no accident,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is truly shameful that the Cuban government is opportunistically exploiting the world's inattention to try to crush domestic dissent.""""  The prosecutions and mass detentions represent the most severe crackdown in Cuba in nearly a decade. They come just as Cuba faces likely condemnation for human rights abuses by the U.N.

Among the many defendants reportedly being tried today are Marcelo López Bañobre, of the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation (Comisión Cubana de Derechos Humanos y Reconciliación Nacional, CCDHRN), Marcelo Cano Rodríguez, also of the CCDHRN, Marta Beatriz Roque, an independent economist, and Oscar Espinoza Chepe, another independent economist.  Prosecutors are reportedly seeking life sentences for some of the defendants, and extremely heavy sentences for others.  Defendants are being prosecuted under the Law for the Protection of Cuban National Independence and the Economy (Ley de Protección de la Independencia Nacional y la Economía de Cuba, Ley 88), which took effect in March 1999, and the Law Reaffirming Cuban Dignity and Sovereignty (Ley de Reafirmación de la Dignidad y Soberanía Cubanas), which took effect in December 1996. The Cuban government justifies both laws as a response to the Helms-Burton Law, a U.S. law that hardened the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba.  The Cuban courts deny defendants basic rights of due process.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/04/02/meanwhile-young-girls-africa-cornered-aids","Meanwhile- Young girls in Africa cornered by AIDS","Meanwhile: Young girls in Africa cornered by AIDS","","04/02/2003","LUSAKA - The strikingly higher infection rates among adolescent girls compared to boys in Zambia and many other parts of Africa reveal a disturbing trend: the AIDS epidemic is being fueled by the abuse and subordination of young women. Sexual violence and coercion of girls is widespread, often fueled by intergenerational sex when men choose younger and younger girls because they are assumed to be HIV-negative. The increasing number of orphans created by the AIDS epidemic is contributing to the crisis. Many girls who are orphaned, or taking care of younger siblings, trade sex to earn a survival income. Such girls are rarely able to negotiate safe sex. Worse still, the perpetrators of abuses against girls, especially orphans, are sometimes members of their own families, or others charged with looking after them, including teachers. The State of the Union announcement by President George W. Bush of a new AIDS initiative for Africa and the Caribbean will need to include measures to protect the rights of girls and young women, or it will be impossible to curb the AIDS epidemic. Interviews conducted recently by Human Rights Watch in Zambia put the gender dimensions of the situation in stark relief. One twelve-year-old orphan described her experience of sexual abuse by relatives. """"My uncle used to beat me with electricity wires,"""" she said. """"Before I went to live with my uncle and auntie, I stayed with my big sister's mother, and my brother used to take me in the bush. Then he raped me. I was eight or nine. I was scared. He said 'I'm going to beat you if you ever tell anyone.""""' The AIDS crisis makes the subordinate status of women and girls lethal. They are hard-pressed to protect themselves from infection when they are economically and socially dependent, and sometimes subject to threats of violence or abandonment. When asked by Human Rights Watch why abusers within the family are not reported to the police, many young women stated, in effect, that bringing a complaint against the breadwinner was unthinkable. Even if they do attempt to bring the case to the police, the chance of an effective response from law enforcement agencies is often minimal, furthering the sense of impunity for perpetrators of such crimes. Women and girls often remain silent rather than confront hostile legal and social structures. Sexual violence and coercion of even very young girls are not unique to Africa, but the AIDS crisis, food shortages, widespread poverty and lack of education makes such abuses more pronounced. Recent studies by the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS have concluded that about half of all those infected worldwide are women and girls. In the worst affected countries in Africa, many girls are pulled out of school to care for sick relatives in AIDS affected families, or simply because their families can no longer afford to pay school fees. An integrated response is needed. Social services for women and girls must be expanded to reduce their vulnerability to transmission. Women's property and inheritance rights must be strengthened, and access to education improved. Sexual violence and coercion of females must be investigated and prosecuted. One of the single most important measures that could be taken to protect girls is to keep their parents alive longer. That means dramatically expanded treatment possibilities. The remedies required to address some of the key vulnerabilities of women and girls are not very costly compared to many other elements of AIDS programs. By integrating a gender dimension into the Bush administration's new AIDS initiative, the United States can take concrete steps to tackle widespread virus transmission among women and girls by making their protection a priority. *The writer is Washington director for Africa of Human Rights Watch.

While use of the weapon has not yet been confirmed by official U.S. military sources, it is evident from television images and stories from reporters embedded with U.S. units that U.S. forces are using artillery projectiles and rockets containing large numbers of submunitions, or cluster munitions. When these submunitions fail to explode on impact as designed, they become hazardous explosive """"duds""""—functioning like volatile, indiscriminate antipersonnel landmines. Two U.S. Marines were killed in separate incidents on March 27 and 28 after stepping on unexploded cluster munitions delivered by artillery in southern Iraq. """"The United States should not be using these weapons,"""" said Steve Goose, executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Iraqi civilians will be paying the price with their lives and limbs for many years."""" Human Rights Watch has identified footage of the use of the Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) by artillery units of the 3rd Infantry Division. This is a system that currently uses only submunition payloads. The 1st Battalion of the 39th Field Artillery Regiment of the division deploys at least eighteen MLRS launch units. The standard M26 warhead for the MLRS contains 644 M77 individual submunitions (also called dual-purpose grenades). According to a Department of Defense report submitted to the U.S. Congress in February 2000, these submunitions have a failure rate of 16 percent. Thus, the typical volley of twelve MLRS rockets would likely result in more than 1,200 dud submunitions scattered randomly in a 120,000 to 240,000 square meter impact area. The Washington Post reported on March 29 that the U.S. MLRS fired eighteen Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) against suspected air defense sites in support of a helicopter attack by units of the 101st Airborne Division on March 28. The payload of an ATACMS is 300 or 950 M74 submunitions with a reported failure rate of two percent. Human Rights Watch has also seen video of U.S. Marine artillery units supporting the 3rd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion using 155mm artillery firing projectiles at Iraqi positions; an embedded reporter described """"hundreds of grenades"""" being fired at the Iraqis. These were apparently the M483A1 and M864 projectiles whose submunitions (dual-purpose grenades) have a 14 percent dud rate. The M483A1 projectile contains eighty-eight dual-purpose grenades, and the M864 projectile contains seventy-two dual-purpose grenades. It is not clear whether air-dropped cluster bombs have been used in the air campaign. Iraqi officials have repeatedly alleged use of cluster bombs by U.S. and U.K. aircraft, but these reports have not been confirmed. U.S. air forces used cluster bombs, notably the CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition, extensively in the first Gulf War in 1991, in Yugoslavia/Kosovo in 1999 and in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002. At least eighty U.S. casualties during the 1991 Gulf War were attributed to cluster munition duds. More than 4,000 civilians were killed or injured by cluster munition duds after the end of the war. Human Rights Watch has called for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions until the humanitarian problems caused by the weapons are addressed. Short of that commitment, Human Rights Watch has urged the United States and others that may deploy cluster munitions in Iraq to prohibit the use of any cluster munitions in attacks on or near populated areas and to suspend use of cluster munitions that have been tested and identified as producing high dud rates. If cluster munitions are used, it is crucial that the U.S. record, report, track, and mark known or suspected cluster munition strike areas and preserve the information so it can be disseminated quickly in clearance efforts. """"The United States must rapidly provide extensive information and warnings to civilian populations to protect them from cluster munition duds,"""" said Goose. """"The United States now bears a special responsibility to help clear these deadly remnants of war as quickly as possible."""" Vast numbers of cluster munition duds will complicate the reconstruction of Iraq as well as endangering civilians and peacekeepers, Goose said.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq, United States","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

The U.N. body, now holding its annual six-week session in Geneva, will begin today (1 April) to debate the human rights situation in particular countries. Several critical resolutions and monitoring initiatives appear to be in doubt:  Rather than pressing for the strong criticism of recent years, western governments are negotiating with the Sudanese government on a weak statement that could put an end to human rights monitoring of the country; Western governments look set to soften their criticism of Russia’s abuses in Chechnya, despite its continued obstruction of international scrutiny; No government appears willing to table a resolution critical of China, thanks especially to Chinese support for the international campaign against terrorism; Several Latin American governments have circulated a mild-mannered resolution welcoming progress on Cuba, despite a wave of recent arrests of dissidents and its failure to admit a special envoy of the High Commissioner on Human Rights. “Unless governments that care about human rights show some political spine, some of the worst human rights offenders may get off the hook,” said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch warned that the Commission was progressively surrendering its role of monitoring the worst human rights abuses. Last year the Commission dropped its scrutiny of Iran and Equatorial Guinea, and failed to criticise Zimbabwe, China and the Russian Federation.  Human Rights Watch said that this year’s Commission was, however, likely to censure North Korea and Turkmenistan for the first time in its history.  “It’s high time the Commission turned a spotlight on two of the most closed and abusive regimes on earth,” said Mungoven. “But its credibility will be undermined if it fails to criticize the most powerful nations as well.”  Human Rights Watch expressed disappointment at the Commission’s failure to hold a special debate on the human rights consequences of war in Iraq. It urged the Commission to call on all warring parties to protect civilians, and to plan for a human rights monitoring in the country in any post-conflict situation.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Cuba, Equatorial Guinea, Sudan, Zimbabwe, China and Tibet, North Korea, Russia, Turkmenistan, Iran, Iraq","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/04/01/west-africa-stop-trafficking-child-labor","West Africa- Stop Trafficking in Child Labor","West Africa: Stop Trafficking in Child Labor","Child labor on cocoa farms 'tip of the iceberg'","04/01/2003","(New York, April 1, 2003) - West African governments are failing to address a rampant traffic in child labor that could worsen with the region’s growing AIDS crisis, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today.   The 79-page report, “Borderline Slavery: Child Trafficking in Togo,” highlights Togo as a case study of trafficking in the region. The report documents how children as young as three years old are exploited as domestic and agricultural workers in several countries. Traffickers lure children from their homes with promises of high-quality schooling and vocational training abroad. Many of the children are orphans, forced to become breadwinners following the death of a parent from AIDS or other causes.   A scandal over the issue of child labor in West Africa blew up in 2002, when nearly half the chocolate produced in the United States was linked to cocoa beans harvested by child laborers in Côte d’Ivoire. Many of these children had been trafficked from neighboring countries such as Mali and Burkina Faso.   “The cocoa farms are the tip of the iceberg,” said Jonathan Cohen, researcher with Human Rights Watch and author of the report. “Trafficking in child labor occurs along numerous routes in West Africa, and governments aren’t doing enough to stop it.”   Girls interviewed by Human Rights Watch were told to board ships for Gabon, where they worked as housemaids or in markets. In a September, 2001 case documented in the report, a boat ferrying hundreds of trafficked girls sank off the coast of Cameroon, killing nine. Other cases document girls being treated as virtual slaves, forced to work day and night peddling goods in the market, fetching water, and caring for young children. Most endured beatings and psychological abuse, including death threats and warnings they would never see their parents again.   “Orphans face many grave human rights abuses, and trafficking is surely one of the worst,” said Cohen. “Without government action, today’s orphans may be traded tomorrow into servitude.”   The report links child trafficking to years of desperate poverty and freezes on development assistance to Togo, exacerbated by President Gnassingbé Eyadema’s refusal to hold free and fair elections. The European Union suspended bilateral aid to Togo in 1993 after the country’s first elections were marred by intimidation and disqualification of opposition parties.   Young Togolese boys told Human Rights Watch they could not afford to pay school fees and so agreed to do agricultural work in Nigeria. They said they cleared brush, planted seeds and plowed fields for up to thirteen hours a day, getting beaten if they complained of fatigue. Some were forced to use machetes to cut the branches of trees and wounded themselves seriously. After eight months to two years, they were given a bicycle and told to pedal it home to Togo.   “Boys were robbed by bandits, forced to bribe soldiers and deprived of food on their way home,” Cohen said. “Some died and were buried on the side of the road.”   A draft Togolese law prohibits child trafficking and imposes a U.S.$1,500-$15,000 penalty on anyone who “recruits, transports, transfers, harbors or receives” a child for the purpose of sexual or labor exploitation, forced labor or slavery. In 2001, Togo arrested or detained ten traffickers for related offenses such as kidnapping or procuring. Few cases were prosecuted to completion.   The Togolese government also fails to provide basic protections to children who flee their traffickers. Girls who escaped described spending nights on the street, knocking on the doors of churches and accepting invitations to sleep at the homes of strangers. Some were driven into prostitution in a district of Lomé, Togo’s capital, dubbed the “marché du petit vagin” (“market of the small vagina”). There they faced a high risk of contracting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.   “Some children are double victims of AIDS: first when their parents die from the disease, and then when they are trafficked and subjected to likely HIV infection,” said Cohen. “It is up to the government to break this vicious circle.”   Human Rights Watch called on the Togolese government to ratify international treaties prohibiting child trafficking, and made detailed recommendations to the governments of Togo, Gabon, Nigeria, Benin, Niger, Ivory Coast and Ghana regarding the prevention and punishment of trafficking, as well as the protection of trafficked children. Human Rights Watch also called on the United Nations and donors supporting these governments to summon their financial, technical and diplomatic resources to see these efforts through.   “Child traffickers have outwitted West African governments at every turn,” Cohen said. “Togo adopted a national plan of action on child trafficking six years ago, and the problem continues unabated.”    Children's testimonies of child trafficking in Togo All names have been changed to protect the identity of the witnesses.   On their recruitment by child traffickers:  My friend had an aunt in Gabon, and she came and saw the conditions we were living in. She said she had a good job in Gabon, so I should accompany her there and work with her. My mother was very seriously ill, and my friend’s aunt said that when we got to Gabon, she would find me a job as a trader so that I could send money to my mother for medicine…I was willing to go because of how she spoke about it. She never said how much money I would be making. —Dado K., age twenty-nine, trafficked to Gabon when she was sixteen  I was going to school here, but things weren’t going well. We were poor and had no money, so I decided it would be a good idea to go to Nigeria. Life was hard, and a friend told me I should go, so I decided to because I wasn’t doing anything here. I thought if I could go to Nigeria and get rich, I could come back and learn a trade. I knew people who had been and come back, and they brought back a lot of things: bicycles, radios, sewing machines, some even brought second-hand motorcycles. They told me they worked in the fields and made a lot of money, but none of them wanted to go back. They said the traffickers deceived them—they said, when you go you won’t do any difficult work, you will only do small work and make lots of money. I thought I could do it. —Etse N., age eighteen, trafficked to Nigeria when he was seventeen   On their transport to a country of destination: After I waited five months in Nigeria, a man came and took me to a boat. On the boat, there were over 100 other children, Togolese, Nigerian, and there were some adults, but more children than adults. I talked to some of them, and all the girls were going to Gabon to work. It took three days on the boat to get to Gabon. They gave us gari [a dough made of manioc] and sometimes bread to eat. —Dansi D., age sixteen, trafficked to Gabon when she was thirteen  The boat was very full . . . . There were no toilets. There were girls defacating on each other and vomiting in the boat. It was impossible to vomit into the sea without falling off the boat. —Atsoupé S., fourteen, trafficked to Gabon when she was thirteen  We left very early in the morning in a car. We went to Kambolé for three days and then to Tchamba. In Kambolé, there were seven boys in the house where we stayed. The man looked for a vehicle to take us. When we left, there were nine of us; the others were older than I was. It was a truck with room for baggage. We had to get out of the truck at the border. The crossing was difficult; we were practically in the bush. It took one week to get to Iseyin because we broke down on the way. —Mawuena W., age nineteen, trafficked to Nigeria when he was eleven   On their receipt and exploitation: The woman took us to her daughter and daughter’s husband. Our job was to sell bread. There were two other girls living in the house doing domestic work. We sold bread in the market, circulating from 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning until night. At the end of each day we gave all the money to our patronne. We were given 75 CFA francs (about U.S.10¢) per day for lunch. At night we baked the bread for the next day. When we got home, our boss gave us the flour for the next day’s bread. She showed us how to make the bread, and we did it with her and the two other girls. The boss was not nice to us. If we didn’t sell all the bread in one day, she would beat us with a stick…The oven would burn our feet. Once I thought the fire was out so I walked on it and got burned. —Afi A. and Ama D., ages eleven and twelve, trafficked to Anié, Togo when they were ten and eleven  If anyone didn’t work well, they would yell. If you said you were sick, they never believed it, and you had to keep working. It was only when someone had a cut on the leg from a machete or something else that they could see bleeding that they would let you stop working. We were there for eleven months. At the end of that time, we got bikes. We had to find the path to get home; the guy who showed us had to be paid. It took nine days to get home, and we only could eat some days because of people of good will in Benin. —Yawo S., age seventeen, trafficked to Nigeria when he was nine   On their return to their country of origin: I decided to talk to the customers who came to [the market] to see if they could help me. Finally a boy told me that he would take me back to Togo if I would marry him. I was desperate, so I said yes just to get out. Now my brothers are working hard in the fields to pay off that boy so I don’t have to marry him. I’m back living with them, and I’m in an apprenticeship again for hairdressing. The boss there lets me make some money sometime pounding and selling fufu [a dough made of yams or cassava]. —Sogbossi K., age sixteen, trafficked to Nigeria when she was fifteen  After nine months, they gave us a bike and a radio. Someone showed us the road for going home, and we had to pay him, too. He left us in Benin. We came back on our bikes—it took nine days. We had to pay 500 CFA [about U.S.75¢] to cross each of the two rivers. After five days, we ran out of the gari we had in the beginning. —Koudjo N., age nineteen, trafficked to Nigeria when he was fifteen","Africa, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Togo","Children's Rights, Health, Women's Rights, Child Labor, Migrant and Refugee Children, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis, Sexual and Reproductive Health, Exploitation, Forced Labor & Trafficking, Migrants, Refugees and Migrants"

Vietnam has signed UN treaties protecting the right to free expression. Yet it's locking up citizens using the Internet to express their views,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"This is going on while Vietnam is participating in deliberations of the United Nations' highest human rights body. Delegates should publicly call on Vietnam to cease these arrests."""" Human Rights Watch condemned the arrest of noted physician Dr. Nguyen Dan Que on March 17, 2003 outside his home in Ho Chi Minh City. According to the Vietnamese foreign ministry, Dr. Que will be prosecuted under Article 80 of the Vietnamese Criminal Code for sending information critical of the Vietnamese government via the Internet. Article 80 covers crimes of espionage and carries a sentence ranging from twelve years to the death penalty. Officials claim he was arrested at an Internet café, though his family disputes this claim. Police searched his house and confiscated his laptop computer and written essays.  Dr. Que, a well-known democracy and human rights advocate, was released as part of a prisoner amnesty in 1998 while serving a 20-year prison sentence. Even upon his release, he has remained under heavy surveillance and has been prohibited from resuming his medical practice as an endocrinologist. His family has had no access to him since his arrest on March 17.  Last year, Human Rights Watch honored him with Hellman/Hammett grant, an award recognizing repressed writers worldwide.  """"Dr. Que should be immediately and unconditionally released,"""" said Adams. """"Under international law, he has committed no crime.""""  Other dissidents in Vietnam have been detained in recent months and given harsh sentences, many of them for using the Internet to express their views. Last December, Nguyen Khac Toan was sent to prison for twelve years on charges of espionage. An appeal of his sentence is set to be heard on April 2.  Pham Que Duong was arrested on December 28, 2002 and indicted under Article 80, but has not yet been put on trial. He is 71 years old and a former colonel in the People's Liberation Army who quit the Communist Party and became a democracy activist; his family is not allowed to provide him urgently needed food and medicine in prison.  Last October, Li Chi Quang was arrested in an Internet café in Hanoi while sending an email message to a democracy advocate abroad. He received a four-year sentence on charges of disseminating propaganda against the state.  Pham Hong Son was arrested in March 2002 and charged with espionage under Article 80. His crime was to have translated an article on democracy from the U.S. Embassy website, which he sent to some of his friends and senior Vietnamese officials. The translation was later posted on the Internet.  Vietnam is currently one of 53 members of the UN Commission on Human Rights. It has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which, under Article 19, protects the right to """"seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, or through any other media of his choice.""""  Vietnam's Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dao Viet Trung, spoke at the Commission in Geneva on March 19 and specifically referred to Hanoi's commitment to the ICCPR.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/31/double-standards","Double Standards","Double Standards","","03/31/2003","NEW YORK -- Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has at last recognized the Geneva Conventions. Observing, correctly, that Iraq´s televised display of captured American soldiers violated the laws of war, Rumsfeld said that the conventions spell out the rules governing international armed conflict. The United States is right to insist that Iraq honor the Geneva Conventions. But its position is weakened by failure to practice what it preaches in holding 641 prisoners without charges at the U.S. military facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Most of the Guantánamo prisoners were captured during the U.S. war against the Taliban government of Afghanistan. The Bush administration says that the men were all combatants, but has refused to treat them as the laws of war require. Under the Geneva Conventions, combatants captured in an international armed conflict must be treated as prisoners of war unless and until a ‘‘competent tribunal´´ determines that a specific prisoner is not entitled to that status. The U.S. government chose not to convene such tribunals for the Afghanistan war captives even though it has routinely convened them in past hostilities. Instead, the United States decreed that no member of the Taliban´s armed forces was entitled to POW status — a decision that most independent international law experts found legally untenable. Furthermore, the United States insisted that no members of Al Qaeda deserved Geneva Conventions protection — not even those captured while fighting for Taliban armed forces. The United States recently released 18 Guantánamo detainees, having concluded that they pose no threat to the international community. Five others were released previously. But hundreds remain in detention, for over a year now. Held without charges, they are in a legal limbo and subject, presumably, to continued interrogation. The release of some detainees is welcome. Even more welcome from the Bush administration would be an acknowledgment that under the Geneva Conventions the United States lacks legal authority to hold many of the others. Indeed, at least three categories of prisoners at Guantánamo are unlawfully detained. The first group is Taliban soldiers. In the war between Afghanistan and America, the Geneva Conventions permitted the United States to hold as prisoners without charges members of the Taliban government´s armed forces. But that war ended in June when the Hamid Karzai government assumed power in Kabul. The laws of war do not permit the continued detention of those soldiers unless they are being prosecuted for war crimes or other offenses. They should be released and repatriated. The second group consists of civilians who — according to news reports quoting unnamed U.S. intelligence officials — were mistakenly sent to Guantánamo. The laws of war permit the internment of civilians in a war only when such detention is imperative for security reasons. If there are indeed civilians at Guantánamo who have no connection to the Taliban or Al Qaeda and who are not being prosecuted, they too must be released. Finally, at least some suspected Al Qaeda members apprehended far from Afghanistan may have been brought to Guantánamo. Six, for example, were picked up in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The laws of war do not apply to persons who were not captured on a battlefield and who have no direct connection to an armed conflict. President George W. Bush has repeatedly said that the war against terrorism is a war of values. At Guantánamo, that war is being lost. At risk are not only the rights of the individuals who are unlawfully detained today: by ignoring the clear mandates of international law, the United States invites every other country, including Iraq, to do the same.

On March 29 at a U.S. military roadblock near Najaf, an Iraqi noncommissioned officer reportedly posing as a taxi driver detonated a car bomb that killed him and four U.S. soldiers. Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan said at a Baghdad news conference that such attacks would become “routine military policy.” International law prohibits attacking, killing, injuring, capturing or deceiving the enemy by resorting to what is called perfidy. A perfidious attack is one launched by combatants who have led opposing forces to believe that the attackers are really noncombatants. Acts of perfidy include pretending to be a civilian (who cannot be attacked) or feigning surrender (surrendering soldiers also cannot be attacked) so that opposing forces will let down their guard at the moment of attack. Other examples include feigning protective status by the misuse of emblems of the United Nations or the red cross and red crescent.  Perfidy poses particular dangers because it blurs the distinction between enemy soldiers, who are a valid target, and civilians and other noncombatants, who are not. Soldiers fearful of perfidious attacks are more likely to fire upon civilians and surrendering soldiers, however unlawfully.  Attacks carried out by openly armed belligerents in civilian clothes, with no attempt to feign civilian status, do not constitute perfidy. Suicidal attacks by undisguised military forces, exemplified by Japanese kamikaze attacks during World War II, are not a violation of the laws of war. Perfidy is distinguished from ruses of war, such as mock operations, misinformation, surprises, ambushes, or the use of camouflage or decoy. Ruses are permissible acts of warfare intended to trick the enemy; they do not violate international law to the extent that they do not depend on taking advantage of an enemy’s willingness to abide by the law protecting noncombatants","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq",""

On March 22, an armed group of eight men broke into the Port Harcourt home of Ledum Mitee, searching for him unsuccessfully. Mitee is president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP) and has been a strong critic of the Rivers State government.  An eyewitness reported to Human Rights Watch that in the early morning of Saturday, March 22, eight men armed with sophisticated rifles scaled the outer fence of Mitee’s residential compound and entered the home by climbing a ladder and entering through an upstairs door. The men, who were partially masked, gathered the seven occupants of the home at gunpoint and demanded to be led to Ledum Mitee. When it was explained that Mitee was traveling out of the country, the intruders searched through the whole house, then departed, warning that they would return. They took nothing from the home except for a cellular telephone and did not harm any of the occupants. Mitee had originally planned to return from a trip abroad the day before this incident.  “Threats and intimidation against political activists are another worrying sign of the level of political violence in the country,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. “This comes on top of political assassinations and fighting between supporters of different political factions, which have led to scores of deaths across Nigeria in the last few months.”  Ledum Mitee and at least one other MOSOP leader had previously received threats, including phone calls warning them to “steer clear” of their political positions, and there were indications that the security services were closely watching their activities. On the evening of March 23, Legborsi Saro Pyagbara, programme officer at MOSOP, was arrested and questioned by the police at Lagos Airport as he was preparing to travel to London, on his way to attend the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The police asked him why MOSOP had decided to send him out of the country at this time, and what MOSOP hoped to achieve. He was released after about four hours.  MOSOP, formerly led by late Ken Saro-Wiwa, promotes the rights of the minority Ogoni ethnic group in the oil-producing Niger Delta. It has frequently criticized the Rivers State government headed by Governor Peter Odili of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s ruling party, accusing it of systematically using violence for political ends among other abuses. MOSOP has also criticized the federal government and police for failing to control political violence.  Rivers State is the home state of late Marshall Harry, vice chairman for the south-south zone of Nigeria’s main opposition party, the All Nigeria People’s Party (ANPP), who was murdered in his residence in the federal capital, Abuja, on March 5.  Mitee was interviewed on the radio on March 8, just a few days after the killing of Marshall Harry, criticizing the state government’s use of violence. MOSOP had also organized meetings in Ogoniland in February, to which local candidates from all parties were invited to present their platforms, and urged voters not to support candidates who were not credible or who had used political violence in the past.  Human Rights Watch urged the federal government and police to urgently investigate this incident and all cases of political violence, and to bring the perpetrators to justice regardless of their political affiliation.  “We are asking the authorities to ensure the safety of activists and to respect the right of all Nigerians to express their views without fear of violence,” said Takirambudde.","Africa, Nigeria","Free Speech"

The children are subjected to brutal treatment as soldiers, laborers and sexual slaves.  Since June of 2002, an estimated 5,000 children have been abducted-a striking increase from 2001, when fewer than 100 children were abducted. In total, an estimated 20,000 children have been abducted during the 16-year conflict between the LRA and the Ugandan government.  """"The increase in abductions is dramatic and alarming,"""" said Jo Becker of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"More children have been taken in the last 10 months than in any previous year of the conflict.""""  The surge in abductions followed the return of the LRA to Uganda after the Ugandan government launched a military offensive, """"Operation Iron Fist,"""" against the LRA's bases in southern Sudan in March of last year.  Children abducted by the LRA are frequently beaten, and forced to carry out raids, burn houses, beat and kill civilians, and abduct other children. They must carry heavy loads over long distances and work long hours as virtual slaves. Many are given weapons training and some are used to fight the Ugandan army, the Uganda People's Defense Force (UPDF). Girls are sexually enslaved as """"wives"""" to LRA commanders, and subjected to rape, unwanted pregnancies, and the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS.  The LRA uses brutal tactics to demand obedience from abducted children. Children are forced to beat or trample to death other children who attempt to escape, and are repeatedly told they will be killed if they try to run away.  The 31-page report, """"Stolen Children: Abduction and Recruitment in Northern Uganda"""" draws on interviews with children who have recently escaped from LRA captivity. The majority of those interviewed were abducted after the escalation of the conflict last year.  """"Children live in fear,"""" said Becker. """"They know that if they are abducted they will be brutalized, possibly killed, and may never see their families again.""""  Every night thousands of children pour into Gulu and other northern Ugandan towns from surrounding areas, hoping to avoid abduction. They sleep on verandas, in bus parks, on church grounds, and at local hospitals before returning home again the next morning. In February 2003, Human Rights Watch observed nearly 3,000 individuals, the vast majority unaccompanied children, seeking refuge at Lacor hospital in Gulu. These children are known locally as """"night commuters.""""  Uganda's government also recruits children. Human Rights Watch documented the recruitment of children as young as 12 into Local Defense Units, also known as home guards. These children are trained, and sometimes fight, with the Ugandan army. Boys who manage to escape from LRA captivity, particularly those with combat experience, are also pressured to join the UPDF while in UPDF custody for debriefing.  Human Rights Watch called on both the LRA and the Uganda government to comply with international standards prohibiting the recruitment and use of children as soldiers.  """"The abduction of children has destroyed the lives of thousands of children and their families,"""" said Becker. """"The United Nations should appoint a special envoy to act on behalf of these children and to seek their release.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is now meeting in Geneva, to request that the UN Secretary-General appoint a special envoy to seek the release of the abducted children, by conducting """"shuttle diplomacy"""" between the LRA and the Ugandan government. A broad group of Ugandan and international non-governmental organizations has endorsed the proposal. These include humanitarian agencies working in the north such as Save the Children, International Rescue Committee, Norwegian Refugee Council, and World Vision International.  On March 2, the leader of the LRA, Joseph Kony, announced a unilateral ceasefire. The government initially rejected the declaration, but later announced a limited ceasefire to allow for talks with the LRA. However, the LRA did not appear at sites designated by the government for the talks, and LRA fighters have violated Kony's ceasefire announcement by attacking and abducting civilians","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict, Joseph Kony - Lord's Resistance Army"

Human Rights Watch said widespread reprisal killings, retaliatory forced displacement, and other acts of violence against resettled families are possible once tens of thousands of forcibly displaced people return to reclaim their homes. Oil-rich Kirkuk, currently under Iraqi government control, has been the target of U.S. aerial bombing for the last several days. U.S. paratroopers have landed in Iraqi Kurdistan and it is likely that U.S. and coalition ground forces will enter the city in the near future.  """"Kirkuk is a disaster waiting to happen,"""" said Hania Mufti, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Arbil. """"If a plan for the gradual and orderly return of these displaced civilians is not drawn up soon and implemented before the ground offensive begins, there is a real possibility that the city will erupt into inter-ethnic violence.""""  Since the 1991 Gulf War, the Iraqi government has systematically expelled an estimated 120,000 Kurds, Turkomans, and Assyrians from Kirkuk and other towns and villages in this oil-rich region. Most have settled in the Kurdish-controlled northern provinces. Meanwhile, the Iraqi government has resettled Arab families in their place in an attempt to reduce the political power and presence of ethnic minorities, a process known as """"Arabization.""""  Those who were displaced were forced to abandon their homes, were stripped of most of their possessions, and were deprived of any means of livelihood. Scores of expelled Kurds and Turkomans interviewed by Human Rights Watch during a September 2002 mission to Iraqi Kurdistan described the relentless pressure by the state to drive them from their homes by making their daily lives intolerable.  Human Rights Watch researchers now based in Iraqi Kurdistan said the United States has not prepared for returning displaced residents of Kirkuk.  """"We have found no evidence that U.S. political and military leaders have prepared for the consequences of a massive influx of returnees with grievances against those who forced them from their homes, as well as those who now live in their homes,"""" said Mufti.  During talks in Ankara in March 2003, U.S., Turkish and Iraqi opposition officials discussed the idea of creating a coalition commission to oversee issues relating to the northern front, including the orderly return of internally displaced people to Kirkuk. To date, however, no such commission has been established. Kurdish officials told Human Rights Watch that they were uncertain as to the role of their armed forces during any eventual ground offensive on Kirkuk. Both Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) leader Mas'ud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani have agreed to commit their Pesh Merga forces only with U.S. approval and under its command. Until now, the United States has not asked for such participation, but that position could change in the light of Turkey's refusal to grant access to U.S. forces through its territory.  """"It is paramount that the United States immediately address the consequences of a future assault on Kirkuk,"""" said Mufti.  Human Rights Watch urged the United States to make concrete plans for the gradual and orderly return of forcibly displaced residents, for the control of mass population flows, for the removal of land mines and unexploded ordinance, and for the implementation of security measures to deal with any outbreaks of violence.  In recent days, Human Rights Watch researchers have met with representatives of the Iraqi opposition, including the PUK, KDP, the Iraqi Turkoman Front, and the Iraqi National Congress, to discuss what preparations have been made to regulate the return of displaced families to Kirkuk. Kurdish officials have expressed serious concern about the potential for inter-ethnic violence in the city, but said there was very little they could do to stop a large-scale return since displaced families had every right to reclaim their homes as soon as possible. Some also said that """"a significant number"""" of Arab families settled in Kirkuk had already left and that they hoped their departure would mitigate any violence. However, more recent information indicates that the Iraqi government has forcibly returned some of these Arab families to Kirkuk and to a number of villages in the province that were also included in the """"Arabization"""" process.  Human Rights Watch called on all parties to the conflict in Iraq to respect the safety and freedom of movement rights of all Iraqi citizens, including their right to choose a place of residence, and to move to a place of safety either inside or outside Iraq.  Under international humanitarian law, the U.S.-led forces have a duty to restore and ensure public order and safety in territories under their authority from the moment they establish effective control over them. In order to do so, they need to devote enough personnel to ensure public safety, grant protection to all noncombatants, and prevent the occurrence of acts of reprisal or revenge.  Human Rights Watch called upon the U.S. government and its coalition partners to undertake, as a matter of urgency, the following measures to prevent the possibility of inter-ethnic violence in Kirkuk:  Call publicly for a gradual and orderly return of internally displaced persons to Kirkuk and other affected areas. Establish a commission of coalition partners to address matters relating to the return of the former residents of Kirkuk, including the control of population flows, the clearance of land mines and unexploded ordinance, and the prevention of inter-ethnic strife. Make every effort to secure government buildings in Kirkuk that could contain Iraqi government documents pertaining to the """"Arabization"""" policy, including property deeds and nationality registration records. Such documentation will be essential for a speedy and fair resolution of all claims on homes and property, for family tracing and reunification efforts and for future accountability for crimes committed by Iraqi officials. Human Rights Watch also called upon the Kurdish authorities to go beyond making general appeals to returning families that no reprisals be carried out against Arab families settled by the Iraqi government in Kirkuk. The Kurdish authorities should:  Develop a plan, to be made public as soon as possible, for the gradual and orderly return of displaced families to Kirkuk. For example, organizing the return of groups of displaced civilians according to the districts from which they were expelled. Continue to compile records establishing the ethnicity and place of origin of displaced civilians, including duplicates of nationality correction forms, confiscated expulsion orders, and ration cards. Provide a public and accessible family tracing and reunification registry and service. Finally, Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to return to northern Iraq to assist in this and other humanitarian efforts. The United Nations should: Draw up a plan for the speedy dispatch of human rights monitors to Iraq, including Kirkuk, once hostilities have ceased. Provide technical and financial assistance to the Kurdish authorities to create a central registry of displaced persons based on ethnicity, place of origin, and property claims, as well as a public family tracing and reunification registry and service. Establish a mechanism for the adjudication of disputes in Kirkuk and other affected areas with respect to property claims and other assets.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, United Kingdom, Iraq",""

In a new report released at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch highlighted abuses being committed around the world in the name of the international fight against terrorism. The report includes case studies from China, Egypt, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, United States and Uzbekistan.  “We’ve been concerned since September 11 that governments would use the war against terror to justify human rights abuses,” said Rory Mungoven, global advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “Now this trend is becoming more systematic, with lasting effects on the human rights landscape.”  The Human Rights Watch report highlights systematic violation of due process rights, far-reaching restrictions on civil liberties, crackdowns against internal political movements, allegations of torture, tightening of controls on refugees and migrants and arbitrary detention of non-nationals. For instance:  The United States’ response to September 11 has seen the arbitrary and secret detention of non-citizens, secret deportation hearings and the military detention without charge or access to counsel of U.S. citizens designated as """"enemy combatants;” In China, Tibetan and Uighur activists have been accused of terrorism and sentenced to death after unfair trials; In Egypt, the authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected government opponents, many for alleged membership in the Muslim Brotherhood, a banned but non-violent group, and possession of “suspicious” literature; In India, children as young as 12 have been arrested under a sweeping new anti-terrorist law; Russia has justified its abusive war in Chechnya by linking it to the global campaign against terrorism; The United Kingdom has derogated from its human rights obligations and passed new laws which permit the long-term, arbitrary detention of foreign nationals; Terrorist suspects have been extradited between countries extra-legally and without due process, even when they may be at risk of torture. Human Rights Watch welcomed the priority given to this issue by the U.N. Secretary-General and High Commissioner for Human Rights, but warned that the United Nations had failed to respond institutionally to this challenge. The U.N. Security Council has made counter-terrorist measures mandatory for all states, but has excluded human rights from the work of its Counter Terrorism Committee. Many regional organizations have adopted their own counter-terrorist programs, often with sweeping definitions of terrorism and no reference to human rights. Some U.N. human rights bodies and experts have raised concerns but have been unable, by virtue of their limited mandates, to present a comprehensive analysis.  In December last year, the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution affirming the need to protect human rights in counter-terrorist measures, and asked the Secretary-General to report with recommendations for action.  Human Rights Watch urged the Secretary-General to appoint a special representative to focus political attention on the issue, monitor abuses in different countries, and make recommendations and urgent appeals to governments and international and regional bodies.  “Human rights abuses will fuel terrorism, not defeat it,” Mungoven said. “Governments must be stopped from using counter-terrorism as a pretext for repression.”","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, China and Tibet, India, Indonesia, Georgia, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, Uzbekistan, Egypt, Global","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial, Guantanamo"

And this month, the State Department decided that Uzbekistan was not one of them. This decision is absurd. I spent more than two years as Human Rights Watch's representative in Uzbekistan investigating violations of religious freedom there. Those violations affect thousands of people, primarily Muslims whose religious beliefs, practices or affiliations fall beyond those sanctioned by the government. I collected documents on hundreds of cases, interviewed hundreds of witnesses, and observed trial after trial in which judges ignored allegations of torture and coercion and passed down prison sentences of up to 20 years to people whose only crime had been to exercise rights to freedom of expression and religion.These are rights guaranteed under international covenants that Uzbekistan has promised to uphold. The State Department has chosen to ignore this broken promise. The first year that the United States issued IRFA designations was in 1999, and it did not designate Uzbekistan a country of particular concern. But in June of that year, I remember receiving a phone call late one night at my office in Tashkent. An unidentified man asked me to meet him at a mosque on the outskirts of town, saying he had something to show me. After switching cars several times, passing numerous roadblocks, and sneaking through people's backyards to avoid the secret police who crowded the dark streets of the suburban neighborhood, I was taken to the home of 42-year-old Farhod Usmonov. He was the father of six children, a clothing vendor in a nearby bazaar and the son of a well-known imam. He'd been arrested just days earlier for possession of a single leaflet, published by an Islamic group called Hizb-ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), which criticizes Uzbek president Islam Karimov's policies on religion and foreign affairs and which advocates the peaceful establishment of a Caliphate, an Islamic state, in the region. [For additional information see the Eurasia Insight archive]. That summer, Uzbekistani police were cracking down hard on members of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, arresting any Muslim who displayed independence from the narrow state-sanctioned form of Islam. Acceptable practice required praising the president during prayer, endorsing his political agenda, and delivering sermons pre-approved by a Soviet-era relic known as the Muslim Spiritual Board. By 1999, thousands of nonviolent Muslims who demonstrated their independence from the bureaucracy´s strictures – by praying at home or in unregistered mosques or by manifesting what local authorities deemed “too much” religiosity – had been thrown in prison. On that night in June, I confronted the latest victim of the state's persecution of religious dissidents and witnessed the campaign´s incredible cruelty. I entered the modest home to the sight of a dozen wailing women. Each had a story of a son, brother, or father arrested just like Farhod. I listened but there were simply too many stories and I had come for something else. I had come to see a body. I was taken to a room where the windows were closed and curtains drawn so the police outside would not know the family had transgressed orders by showing the body. The heat was oppressive, as was the sickening smell of the corpse mixed with the sweet ceremonial basil leaves placed around Farhod's head. Blood had seeped from his wounds onto the mattress, and black bruises covered his face and torso. It was clear he had not died of just heart failure, as the official death certificate said. Farhod Usmonov had been held incommunicado in police custody for 11 days. The family had only a few hours with his body and no chance for an independent medical exam. He was buried the following day at dawn. Police barricaded the area and detained dozens of men and women who gathered to mourn and pay their respects. The officers responsible for Farhod's death were never brought to justice. Uzbekistan has never been designated a Country of Particular Concern. And in August 2002, Farhod Usmonov's story was repeated. Two more Muslim prisoners – Muzafar Avazov and Husnidin Alimov, men who had been convicted for their nonviolent beliefs and association with Hizb-ut-Tahrir – died from apparent abuse in custody. I met the Avazov family a little more than a year ago, when Muzafar's younger brother had been arrested and tortured in front of him to force the elder to incriminate himself. I can only imagine the family's reaction upon learning that Muzafar, thirty-five years old and the father of four, was returned home with burns, covering sixty to seventy percent of his body, which a doctor said could only have come after someone immersed him in boiling water. I cannot imagine how his family survived the sight of a bloody wound on the back of his head, bruises on his neck and forehead and the horrible story to which his hands, now missing fingernails, gave witness. In this and many other ways Farhod's story continues today. Uzbekistan's campaign against peaceful, independent Muslims shows no sign of abating. Human Rights Watch has documented five suspicious deaths of Muslim prisoners and detainees since January 2002. Thousands more are punished for their beliefs with unending harsh imprisonment and constant mistreatment. These are religious men and women jailed for their faith and unable even to pray in their confinement, on pain of additional beatings and consignment to the dreaded solitary punishment cells. The United States can condemn religious persecution and torture by a government that has become one of our closest allies over the past 18 months. Uzbekistan, like most newly independent states, places a lot of weight on its reputation in the world. Under IRFA, the US president has a menu of options to choose from to pressure a designated country to change its policies and respect religious freedom. These options range from diplomatic demarche to sanctions. Current designated countries include Burma, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Sudan. Since Uzbekistan seems intent on strengthening ties to the United States and upgrading its international reputation, it might adopt quick reforms to avoid penalties and to avoid such associations.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Uzbekistan","Torture"

In a letter sent to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Human Rights Watch recalled gross violations committed in the fifteen-year conflict in southeastern Turkey. Those violations included widespread arbitrary detentions, torture, extrajudicial executions, unlawful expulsions, and destruction of civilian property. Although the conflict with the rebel Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) essentially ended with a unilateral PKK ceasefire in 1999, little has been done in Turkey to hold those responsible for the abuse accountable or to purge the security forces of violators. “Turkey has a bad record of violations against civilians while battling rebel Kurds in southeastern Turkey,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “It needs to be taking precautionary steps today, to make sure its troops don’t commit repeat violations in any operations it undertakes in northern Iraq.”  Human Rights Watch called on the Turkish government to:  Ensure that no troops or units responsible for violations in southeastern Turkey are deployed in any operations in northern Iraq; Not deploy to northern Iraq any paramilitary Village Guards, responsible for many of the violations committed in southeastern Turkey; As a check against abuse, ensure that any operations in northern Iraq are characterized by the maximum possible transparency, including access to the area for non-governmental human rights monitors and journalists; Commit to providing the International Committee of the Red Cross access to any prisoners it may take in northern Iraq; and Facilitate end-use monitoring of military equipment by supplier governments, including the United States and the United Kingdom. “These are the safeguards that Turkey should be putting in place today, regardless of whether they end up engaging in northern Iraq,” Andersen said. “Such confidence-building measures can help reduce tension and prevent any Turkish involvement from turning very ugly.”  Human Rights Watch takes no position on the legal justifiability of war, including U.S.-led military action in Iraq. Its work on Iraq focuses on continuing human rights abuses and the compliance by all parties with international humanitarian law and protections for Iraqi civilians.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Türkiye, Iraq",""

Human Rights Watch, the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights and Physicians for Human Rights called on the Egyptian government to ensure the immediate safety of all detainees; to provide urgent medical care to all who sustained injuries during arrest or in detention; and to launch a full investigation into allegations of torture and ill-treatment.  The organizations also called on the Egyptian government to refrain from referring any of the detainees' cases to State Security Courts, which allow no ordinary appeal. They urged the government to abolish all such courts and repeal its repressive emergency legislation.  """"We fear for the health and safety of those still held,"""" said the three organizations. """"We are deeply alarmed by the message these arrests and beatings send: that dissent in Egypt will be brutally suppressed.""""  Arrests have continued since hundreds of activists and demonstrators, as well as onlookers and passers-by, were detained at and around scattered anti-war rallies held across Cairo on Friday, March 21. Police responded to the demonstrations with excessive force, beating large numbers of participants and conducting arrests. Police also occupied the Lawyers' Syndicate for almost six hours, arresting lawyers both outside and within its precincts. Detainees were taken to the al-Darrassa Central Security Camp as well as to the Lazoghli State Security Investigations Headquarters. Some of those detained have since been released, and sixty-eight were brought before public or State Security prosecutors. However, an unknown number are still being held incommunicado, in violation of the legal requirement that detainees be referred to a prosecution office within twenty-four hours of arrest.  The total number and whereabouts of the detainees remains unknown. Some may still be held at al-Darrassa Central Security camp; some are believed to be at Tora al-Makhoum prison; some may be held in police stations around Cairo. The detainees include at least three children under the age of 15, who were charged at the Qasr al Nil prosecution office on March 22, as well as a 16-year-old girl charged at the al Azbakiya prosecution office. Human Rights Watch received information on March 21 from attorney Gamal 'Id, then held at al-Darrassa camp, that 15-year-olds were being held in a cell with adults.  On Sunday, March 23 authorities arrested more activists, many from their homes, including two opposition members of the People's Assembly. Seven of these arrestees, including the two Members of Parliament, were transferred the same day to the State Security Prosecution Office. On the morning of Tuesday, March 25 an unknown number of Cairo University students were arrested and taken to the Giza State Security Intelligence Headquarters at Gabr ibn Hayyan. A student who was released alleged that others still held there were being tortured to disclose the whereabouts of antiwar activist Kamal Khalil.  The organizations expressed grave concerns about accounts of beatings of demonstrators during arrest and of those held in detention. They include the following:  Activist Manal Khaled and lawyer Ziad Abdel Hamid al-Uleimi were beaten severely when arrested separately on March 21. Manal Khaled also states that State Security officer Hossam Salama threatened her with rape on her arrest. A medical doctor from the Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence, an Egyptian nongovernmental organization, saw both detainees in the al Azbekeyya police station on March 22, and told Human Rights Watch that Manal Khaled's eye was severely injured, while al-Uleimi's arm was broken. Manel Khaled told lawyers and activists on March 25 that she was denied the right to see a forensic doctor to document the injury: a health inspector (mufatish tibbi), a medical officer of lower rank, told her she had sustained eye damage and needed medical attention, but did not treat her or ensure that she received care. Ziad Abdel Hamid al-Uleimi stated that a health inspector had told him his arm was broken in three places, but did not treat him or ensure the provision of care. Both were subsequently beaten again in al-Khalifa police station (see below)  Twelve defendants--including Manal Khaled and Ziad al-Uleimi-- appeared before the al Azbekiya Public Prosecutor on March 22 and were transferred that night to al-Khalifa police station. Officers beat all of them severely with sticks and belts. Lawyers met Manal Khaled as she was being led away from the police station; in tears, she told them that it was a """"death beating session"""" ['alaqat mout] and that """"The guys are being crushed inside. """"Khaled later told lawyers that officers in al-Khalifa threatened her and two other female detainees with rape. One defendant, Gamal 'Id, told lawyers at his renewal hearing that officers beat him so hard they broke a stick on his body; he also said that he believed his arm was broken and he had been denied medical attention.  At least five detainees were reportedly tortured with electroshock at the Lazoghli State Security Investigations Headquarters between the hours of midnight and 2:30 AM on Saturday, March 21, 2003  Nourhan Thabit, a pregnant Cairo University student, was kicked both during her arrest on March 22, 2003, and while held blindfolded and handcuffed in police custody.

The U.S. military command in Qatar announced that on March 26, coalition forces attacked Iraq’s main TV station in Baghdad. The United States said that the attack was intended to damage Iraq’s “command-and-control assets. Under international humanitarian law (the laws of war), armed attacks on civilian TV or radio stations are prohibited if they are designed primarily to undermine civilian morale or to psychologically harass the civilian population. Although stopping enemy propaganda may serve to demoralize the Iraqi population and to undermine the government's political support, neither purpose offers the """"concrete and direct"""" military advantage necessary under international law to make civilian broadcast facilities a legitimate military target.  “Television stations cannot be attacked just because they are used for propaganda purposes,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “The United States needs to explain why the attack against Iraqi TV served a military purpose.”  That Iraqi TV was used to display American prisoners of war, in violation of the Geneva Conventions, does not make it a legitimate military target. Such a violation does not offer a concrete and direct advantage to the Iraqi military.  Civilian TV and radio stations are only legitimate targets if they become military objectives, that is, if they are used in a way that makes an """"effective contribution to military action” and their destruction in the circumstances ruling at the time offers “a definite military advantage."""" Civilian stations could become military targets if, for example, they are used to broadcast military communications or if they are otherwise used concretely to advance a military campaign.  In addition, should stations become military objectives, the principle of proportionality in attack must be scrupulously respected. This means that planners and military commanders should verify at all times that the risks involved to the civilian population in undertaking such attacks do not outweigh the perceived military benefit. Special precautions should be taken in relation to buildings located in urban areas. Advance warning of an attack must be given whenever possible.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

The new policy, part of “Operation Liberty Shield” announced by Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge on March 18, requires the automatic and continued detention of all arriving asylum seekers from a list of thirty-four countries, including Iraq. Many of these countries have well-documented records of human rights abuse that prompt men, women and children to seek refuge in the United States. “The Bush administration has criticized the human rights records of abusive regimes, such as Iraq,” said Alison Parker, a refugee protection expert at Human Rights Watch. “Yet, under this policy, the administration will jail people simply because they have fled those same abusive regimes.” The new policy creates a blanket suspicion of links to terrorism based on nationality alone. Under the policy, for example, the United States would hold in detention a dissident who fled Iran simply because Iran is on the list of countries where there are active terrorist organizations. Any decision to detain an asylum seeker should instead be based on a case-by-case assessment of security risk by an impartial decision maker. Existing U.S. law provides ample authority for the government to detain any person arriving at a U.S. port of entry who may pose a security risk. Under the new policy, asylum seekers could face months and even years behind bars before the immigration bureaucracy finally makes a decision on their claim. Mr. Ridge has stated that asylum seekers will be detained throughout the time that their cases are processed. “People fleeing persecution should not be treated like criminals. Many asylum seekers have spent years in prisons in their home countries. With this new policy, once they reach the United States – supposedly a place of safety – they will be thrown in jail again for months, and perhaps years,” Parker said. Under guidelines issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, detention of asylum seekers should be the exception, not the rule. Detention should not be used if there are effective monitoring mechanisms, such as reporting obligations that offer a viable alternative to detention. When detention is necessary, it should last for only a “minimal” period. Prior to the new policy, asylum seekers arriving to the United States with inadequate documentation were detained, something that Human Rights Watch and other groups have criticized for years. However, even those asylum seekers were eligible for parole from detention, although parole was inconsistently granted. Homeland Security officials have indicated that they will not apply the mandatory detention policy to affirmative asylum applicants, meaning those who apply for asylum not at a port of entry but from within the United States. It was not clear whether the new policy would allow asylum seekers coming from the list of thirty-four countries to be considered for parole from detention. Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. government not to detain asylum seekers based on their countries of origin alone, and to allow all detained asylum seekers to apply for parole.","United States, Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy, Racial Justice","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

On March 26, foreign ministers of the seven countries invited to join NATO are expected to attend the signing of the accession protocols in Brussels. The seven invitees--Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia--are expected to join the alliance by May 2004, following ratification of the accession protocols by parliaments of existing NATO states.  While the world is focused on the threat of weapons of mass destruction and the current war in Iraq, the dangers posed by the uncontrolled trade in conventional weapons must not be ignored, Human Rights Watch said.  According to Human Rights Watch research, potential future NATO members have trafficked conventional weapons to warring parties who are committing serious human rights abuse.  """"NATO needs to set a clear standard on the arms trade and help countries meet it,"""" said Lisa Misol, arms trade researcher with Human Rights Watch. """"Countries that fail shouldn't be admitted until they've cleaned up the trade.""""  The flow of small arms and light weapons, as well as heavier military equipment, from Central and Eastern Europe to conflict zones in Africa and elsewhere has undermined human rights protections for civilians in the recipient countries.  Human Rights Watch has documented that:  Arms traffickers are often able to bypass lax laws to supply weapons to illegal destinations. Governments continue to sell surplus weapons from their arsenals to trouble spots around the globe. Governments continue to authorize arms exports to destinations where the weapons risk fueling human rights abuses and armed conflict. NATO and member states have helped promote important reform efforts in several invitee countries, Human Rights Watch noted, but further work is needed. """"National parliaments should raise the arms trade issue when accession comes up for a vote,"""" Misol said. She added that many NATO countries also need to show leadership by improving their own arms trade behavior.  NATO's secretary-general, Lord George Robertson, has highlighted the importance of arms trade controls.

Under international law, any measure derogating from human rights must be limited to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. Serbia introduced the state of emergency on March 12, following the assassination of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic the same day. The authorities have still not captured the perpetrators, but have detained more than 1000 people pursuant to their state of emergency powers.  “The Serbian government claims, and indeed appears, to be in control of the security situation. Under these circumstances, the government should consider amending or halting certain measures that restrict basic rights,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division.  Under the state of emergency order, the police can detain anyone who “endangers security of other citizens of the Republic” for up to thirty days, without access to a lawyer, family members, or judicial review of the detention order. Human Rights Watch said the incommunicado detention without judicial review is a reason for concern, particularly in light of the repeated cases of reported ill-treatment in police detention during the past two years.  Human Rights Watch urged the Serbian government to consider lifting the ban on contact between detainees and their lawyers and families. The group also suggested that the Serbian government open its detention facilities to independent monitors. Human Rights Watch said that such monitoring would demonstrate Serbia’s commitment to human rights. Human Rights Watch also argued that such monitoring could facilitate effective prosecutions, since detainees might otherwise allege at trial that any confession before the investigating judge was extracted under threat of torture or ill-treatment by police during their incommunicado detention.  Human Rights Watch also called on the authorities to provide for judicial review of detention shortly after the deprivation of liberty. The Human Rights Watch letter to Prime Minister Zivkovic invokes authoritative sources of international law limiting the extent to which a state can depart from the requirement of periodic and effective judicial review of detention.  Human Rights Watch also reminded the Serbian government that the state obligation to respect the right to life applies fully, even under the state of emergency. The Serbian minister of interior recently announced that the police would “liquidate everybody who resists the police” in its attempt to solve the Djindjic assassination. If implemented, this approach would go beyond the strict limitations on the lethal use of firearms by law enforcement officials under international law.  Human Rights Watch also called on the government to rescind the ban on media reporting of the reasons for introduction of the state of emergency.  “It is difficult to see how coverage of the social and political circumstances leading to the March 12 assassination and the state of emergency could hinder the investigation,” Andersen said. “Even in these difficult times—maybe even especially now—the authorities must uphold human rights and the rule of law.”","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Hundreds more have been injured as security forces used water cannons, clubs, dogs, and even stones against demonstrators. Police have arrested leaders of movements protesting the Iraq war and Israeli actions in the Occupied Territories; journalists, professors, and students; and onlookers, as well as children as young as 15 years old.  Some detainees reported hearing the use of electroshock torture in neighboring cells.  """"The crackdown many feared has come,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Fundamental freedoms in Egypt are now under serious threat.""""  What started two months ago with isolated detentions of demonstrators and activists has now become a sweeping repression of dissent, Megally said. He urged Egyptian authorities to immediately investigate credible reports of excessive use of force, including beatings of demonstrators and torture of detainees, and to promptly charge or release those arrested.  The arrests followed a massive demonstration in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo on Thursday March 20, the first day of the war against Iraq. Tens of thousands of protestors rallied, closing the square for over ten hours. While police violently restrained demonstrators from approaching the vicinity of the U.S. and British embassies, they generally allowed the protest to proceed in peace.  The following day, Friday March 21, smaller demonstrations throughout central Cairo drew a violent response. Protesters gathered in areas including Al-Azhar Mosque, Talaat Harb Square, Ramses Street, and the State Broadcasting Corporation. While some onlookers reported scattered stone-throwing by demonstrators, and authorities alleged that protesters torched a car near Tahrir Square, police cracked down with excessive force, both arresting large numbers at the demonstrations and using them as a pretext to detain others.  Eyewitnesses told Human Rights Watch that mid-afternoon on Friday the police retaliated against demonstrators who were pushing against a cordon in Talaat Harb Street. They began beating them with clubs, and then fired water cannons at them. Many demonstrators were injured. A journalist present told Human Rights Watch that his digital camera was damaged and the DVD tape in his video camera confiscated on two separate occasions when he tried to film police striking demonstrators. He saw dozens of demonstrators beaten and arrested.  In other demonstrations, four opposition Members of Parliament--Mohammed Farid Hassanein, Hamdeen Sabahi, Abdel Azim al-Maghrabi, and Haidar Baghdadi--were beaten by police. Sabahi remains hospitalized. In another incident, one demonstrator, Muhammed Abdou Taha, reportedly was beaten and may have suffered a broken spine.  On the evening of March 21, security forces invaded the Lawyers' Syndicate on Ramses Street, and occupied it for almost six hours. Sayyed Abdel Ghany, an official of the Syndicate, told Human Rights Watch that over fifteen lawyers, including some who have defended anti-war demonstrators in the past, were arrested. Many lawyers were severely beaten. Arrests continued on March 22. That morning, Marwa Farouq, Shaymaa Samir, and Nourhan Thabet--three female students who have been prominent antiwar activists--were arrested while attempting to enter Cairo University to attend a demonstration. Nourhan Thabet, who is pregnant, was reportedly beaten, bound and blindfolded. Her whereabouts are unknown and it is feared she has no access to medical care. Sherine Abul-Naga, a professor at the university who attended the rally, was arrested afterward but later released.  Police presence at the small university rally was massive and obvious. Like the Lawyer's Syndicate, Cairo University has traditionally been regarded as a safe space for dissent, where police forces rarely intervene obtrusively.  Additionally, on the afternoon of March 22, Hossam al-Hamalawi, an Egyptian journalist and stringer for the Los Angeles Times who has attended recent anti-war rallies, was arrested while leaving a restaurant in Tahrir Square. Four plainclothes officers seized him, telling the two friends with him, """"He is known to us to be a dangerous man.""""  Most of the detainees were reportedly taken to al-Darrassa, a Central Security (al-Amn al Markazi) barracks in north of Cairo. Others are believed held at the Lazoughli headquarters of State Security Intelligence (Mabahith Amn al-Dawla) in Cairo. Human Rights Watch spoke to one person detained there on March 21 and released early the next morning, who said he heard five people being threatened with and then tortured with electroshocks.  On the morning of March 22, 61 of the detainees were divided into three groups and referred to three prosecution offices in Cairo to be charged. At one prosecution office, Human Rights Watch was able to speak to Gamal 'Id, arrested on March 21, a member of the Lawyers' Syndicate's Freedoms Committee and a human rights lawyer. 'Id said that several other detainees had been beaten so severely on the arms and shoulders that bones appeared to be broken. He added that 72 people detained in the sweeps shared his cell at al-Darrassa, including children as young as 15. Human Rights Watch has documented widespread torture and ill-treatment of children in police custody. """"It is very troubling that many of the witnesses Human Rights Watch has spoken with describe seeing demonstrators being severely beaten by the police as they were taken away,"""" said Megally. """" It is also worrying to hear that children have been arrested and are being held in the same cells as adults.""""  On the evening of March 22, 'Id and eleven other defendants referred to the Azbakeyya Prosecutor were given four days in detention, renewable at the prosecution's discretion. According to the Hisham Mubarak Law Center, an Egyptian human rights organization, prosecutors examining these twelve detainees acknowledged that at least four had serious injuries. Fourteen defendants referred to the Gamalayaa Prosecution Office in Cairo received 15 days' detention, also renewable.  Many of those who have appeared before prosecutors have been charged with offenses such as blocking traffic or destroying public property. Some have been charged with holding a gathering of five or more people without a permit--a crime under Egyptian law.  -----------------Selected Eye-Witness Accounts  Sayed Abd el-Ghany, an official of the Lawyer's Syndicate, told Human Rights Watch:  """"The incursion into the Syndicate began at around 6: 30 PM. A number of lawyers had gathered here to talk about the increasing numbers of people being detained. While we were meeting, some of the demonstrators were marching down Ramses Street [outside the Syndicate], trying to get into Tahrir Square, which was sealed off.  Security officers in plainclothes attacked them. They came up and started beating the demonstrators with clubs. Other uniformed police closed in and assaulted the demonstrators with stones and water cannons. And some of the protesters tried to find refuge here, behind our gates. The Lawyers' Syndicate is believed to be a place of refuge.  Some lawyers went out to try to protect the demonstrators from security forces. They joined the demonstration and were themselves attacked. Then, a group of security officers and police entered the Syndicate and closed the gates, locking everyone inside.  Most of the lawyers outside were beaten and arrested. Each was attacked by five or six officers. Along with some of the demonstrators, they were put in vans. Security beat and detained some of the attorneys who remained inside. They were threatening everyone with detention. They said they were doing this on direct orders from the Ministry of the Interior.  We demanded that they leave. We called the heads of the syndicate and they came; eventually the police began to back off. Eventually, at around 12:30 AM, they left.  This is a dangerous precedent. Lawyers have been arrested and tortured for doing the work of lawyers. A place which represented sanctuary and the possibility of unfettered expression of opinion for many has been raided by police.""""  Attorney Gamal 'Id is a member of the Lawyers' Syndicate's Freedoms Committee, a human rights activist and a Human Rights Watch consultant. He was interviewed in detention at the Azbakeyya Prosecution Office. He told Human Rights Watch:  """"I was arrested outside the Lawyer's Syndicate around 7:00 or 8:00 PM. I was just coming in to the Syndicate. I saw demonstrators outside there in the street, trying to get in. Plainclothesman were beating them with clubs. I tried to help some of the demonstrators; there were other lawyers out there trying to help. Then I was seized by three or four security officers. At first I didn't even know I was being arrested. Several other lawyers tried to intervene to help me and they were beaten severely. Two of the other lawyers who were arrested have arms that are broken, or nearly broken.  Most people who were beaten, were beaten on arrest, and there the beatings were extremely brutal. There are many injured people at al-Darrassa. I can't tell you how many are being held there. My cell holds 72. There are children there as young as 15, perhaps younger. I've heard word that 800 people are in detention; I don't know whether that means only at al-Darrassa, or whether it includes the people held at Lazoughli or other police stations in Cairo.""""  Zuheir (not his real name) is a student in Cairo. He told Human Rights Watch:  """"On Friday, March 21, I went to Tahrir Square to join the demonstrations that were supposed to happen that day. Around 1:45 PM I was standing with a friend in front of Hardee's restaurant, and the demonstrations hadn't started yet. A group of people stopped us and asked for my ID card. Some of them were in uniform, some in plainclothes. They let my female friend go and took me in a big Central Security [Riot Police] van. There were 31 of us, and there were two girls kept in a separate section of the van.  The majority of people looked like they had nothing to do with the demonstrations. There was a Jordanian who had been in Cairo for three days; he was arrested as he was walking out of his hotel. Another one said he was having tea at a café when he was arrested.  We were all taken to the Mansheyyat Nasr Police Station. They took our names and personal data as well as our mobiles. I was able to call family while in the van before they took my phone. We were all kept in one cell for two and a half hours, when we started pounding on the doors. They opened the door then: and they took our personal data again.  We were taken then to the Central Security camp in al-Darrassa. We were the first delegation to arrive there; more people kept arriving for an hour. The camp got so crowded that they kept people in the barracks of soldiers.  Around 8:00 PM I was taken alone to State Security Intelligence in Lazoghli. I went there with an officer, in a small private car. When I got there they blindfolded me. They took me to what seemed like a corridor. I stood there between 8 or so and 2:30 AM. They only allowed me to sit down around midnight. I heard a voice later and was able to raise the mask slightly off my eyes and was able to see a group of four people. Some of them were very young, probably school students. They entered an office one by one and I could hear an officer inside insulting them and yelling at them. I could also hear them receive slaps on their faces and the backs of their necks. I could hear them screaming inside and it was obvious that they were being electroshocked. I heard an officer threaten them with electric shocks and all four of them were tortured with electricity.  Another group of around six people arrived later and they were all bearded. Only one of them received electric shocks.  Around 2:20 AM I was called in, still blindfolded, to a room and an officer questioned me. They let me go around 3 AM.""""  Sanaa (not her real name) was walking in Tahrir Square with her sister Samia (not her real name) early on the afternoon of March 21. She told Human Rights Watch:  """"We saw a group of people in plainclothes harshly beating a woman. They were pulling her hair and insulting her with the dirtiest words. We stood there to watch, when a man pushed us violently. I yelled at him and said, """"How can you touch me?""""--not knowing he was a State Security agent.  We both found ourselves surrounded by about ten people, who seized our hands and pushed us into a police van that was full of men. We were both kept in a separate section of the van from the men. I told one of the guards I would publish all the details. He said he was implementing the orders of the President of the Republic himself.  They took our mobiles and took down our personal data in the van. I asked one of the officers where we were going and he said, """"Behind the sun.""""  We were taken to Mansheyyat Nasr Police Station in Cairo and we arrived there around 2:30 PM. We refused to wait under the staircase, so they put us in the women's cell with women who had been arrested on other charges. We waited there between 3:00 and 4:30 PM, and then we started pounding on the door so they let us out and we were put in the office of an officer. We were there till around 5:30 PM. We were not mistreated there.  Around 6:30 PM we were taken to the Central Security camp in al-Darrassa. They took our personal data again and led the two of us into a place with two beds. We were then joined in the cell by Neveen, who is the secretary to Member of Parliament Hamdeen Sabahi, and Manal Khaled, who is the wife of Sabry al-Sammak [al-Sammak, an antiwar activist and author, was detained by State Security and held for over a week in February 14 2003: see Human Rights Watch press release """"Egypt Growing Number of Arrests."""" They were blindfolded and handcuffed. Manal Khaled had been harshly beaten.  The two of us were released at 9 AM Friday morning.""""  Hoda (not her real name), is from Cairo. She told Human Rights Watch:  """"They tried to arrest me two times. The first one was Friday morning. I was walking through Tahrir Square alone: I didn't even know there might be demonstrations that day, I was doing nothing, minding my own business. Suddenly two guys tried to grab me. They took me, held me, took my name, my address, everything. And they tried to shove me in a police van. By coincidence there was a reporter nearby and he was taking notes and he asked the plainclothesmen what they were doing with me. They let me out.  Later in the morning I saw people holding cameras and the police would take the camera from them and beat them. I saw six or seven people arrested from the street near Tahrir.  The next time I was almost arrested was in the afternoon. A group of us were standing in front of the Lawyer's Syndicate. The uniformed police made this circle around us. We weren't getting violent with them. There were plainclothes police inside the circle with us and they started picking people by looks--if they didn't like your looks they would drag you out of the circle to a police van. They picked a friend of ours who was very tall. They just picked him up and dragged him to the van. We followed, shouting. We said, """"If you take him, take us."""" They started hitting us. We were four people. They hit us with sticks, and one girl they took by her hair and dragged her along, kicking her. They touched her all over--they touched women all over, feeling their breasts. They threw us inside the van. There were five or six other people already arrested in there, I think, it was dark and I couldn't see clearly. And then for whatever reason, they changed their minds and let the four of us go.  In the afternoon I saw a lot of things. There was a point where the police cordon drew back, and there was a firefighter's van that had been behind the cordon, one of the ones they use for the water cannons, and it caught fire. They said the demonstrators burned it but it looked like the police did it--why else would the cordon draw back for no reason? But after the van caught fire the police went wild. On the Corniche [the street along the Nile], there was a kid who was 17, maybe younger. And there were about 20 or 30 police around him, beating him. When some of us tried to beg them, """"He's young, don't kill him,"""" they kept on hitting him.  Lots of people were being beaten. There were people getting beaten everywhere. A friend of ours tried to pull a soldier out of the path of a crowd that was coming and the soldier turned on him and, with other soldiers, started beating him.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","Free Speech"

The Commission, which is the United Nations' major human rights forum, began its annual meeting in Geneva this week. The Commission has in the past held special debates in response to human rights crises in the former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, Chechnya, East Timor, and Israel and the Occupied Territories. """"The Commission on Human Rights should act now to protect human rights both during and after the war,"""" said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative for Human Rights Watch. """"It should establish a monitoring presence inside Iraq as soon as conditions permit.""""  Human Rights Watch warned that the current war may have devastating consequences for the civilian population of Iraq:  civilians may suffer as a result of indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks by US and allied forces; Iraqi military forces may commit abuses or use civilians as human shields; local armed groups opposed to the Iraqi government may commit revenge killings and other abuses;  hundreds of thousands of people may be displaced from their homes and prevented from seeking refuge in neighboring countries; the destruction of infrastructure and disruption to basic services may threaten public health and safety. Human Rights Watch said the Commission should insist upon full, prompt and impartial investigations of any allegations of war crimes, crimes against humanity and other serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Commission could put its own investigative experts on stand-by or request the Secretary-General to appoint an international commission of experts for this purpose. Human Rights Watch also urged the Commission to request the establishment of a human rights monitoring presence inside Iraq at the first opportunity. The Commission and U.N. General Assembly have called for such monitors for many years, but Iraqi authorities never agreed to the proposal.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","United Nations"

According to the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, a detaining authority in wartime has a clear obligation not to parade POWs, or allow them to be exposed to the public. The prohibition is not a blanket ban on any image whatsoever of a POW; for example, it would not extend to incidental filming of POWs, when journalists are documenting broader military operations. But a detaining authority in wartime has a clear obligation not to parade POWs, or allow them to be exposed to the public. Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention (relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War) states: “Prisoners of war must at all times be humanely treated. ... Likewise, prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity. Measures of reprisal against prisoners of war are prohibited.” In general, this provision requires that the authorities of the detaining power be proactive in defending the honor and moral integrity of the prisoner of war. Every POW when questioned is required only to give name, rank, serial number and date of birth. This provision protecting POWs from “public curiosity” appears to have been violated by both the Iraqi and the U.S. governments. The Iraqi government has filmed American POWs and interrogated them before cameras. The U.S. government has taken insufficient measures to prevent journalists embedded with U.S. forces from filming Iraqi POWs held by the United States. U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has appropriately criticized the Iraqi filming of American POWs. However, he has said nothing to date about the filming of Iraqi POWs by media operating alongside U.S. forces. This is not the first time that Secretary Rumsfeld has been unresponsive to concerns that the United States may be acting in violation of the Geneva Conventions. Human Rights Watch and others have previously criticized the U.S. government for aspects of its treatment of captured persons during the war in Afghanistan, particularly the failure to properly determine the legal status of those held, and “stress and duress” techniques that might amount to torture under international law. “American POWs in Iraqi custody need all the help they can get to secure their Geneva Convention rights,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “It’s unfortunate that the United States hasn’t been a more staunch defender of the Geneva Conventions in its own recent conduct.” U.S. forces have accorded POW status to Iraqi soldiers they have detained in recent days. Executing or otherwise mistreating prisoners of war is a war crime. The Iraqi government’s treatment of U.S. POWs in the previous Gulf War gives serious grounds for concern about their treatment currently.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""

Colburn was sentenced to death for the 1994 murder of Peggy Murphy and is slated to be put to death by lethal injection on March 26. """"The death penalty should not be used against one of the most vulnerable populations in society - the mentally ill,"""" said Jamie Fellner, director of Human Rights Watch's U.S. Program. """"Schizophrenic's minds are racked by psychosis and delusions. Surely imprisonment is sufficient sanction for his crime and protection for society."""" James Colburn was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic while a teenager, but received only sporadic treatment for his condition. He spent time in various mental institutions and attempted suicide at least fifteen times. Symptoms of his illness included auditory and visual hallucinations that told him to harm himself and those around him. He reportedly was commanded by these hallucinations to attack his victim, Peggy Murphy. After he realized what he had done, he called the police and immediately confessed. A court appointed psychologist confirmed his mental illness in 1995. In prison, he continues to suffer from delusions and hallucinations. In a letter to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, Human Rights Watch also said that there are serious questions about Mr. Colburn's competence during the trial. He reportedly slept through most of his trial after being given powerful anti-psychotic drugs. The U.S. Supreme Court first granted him a stay in November 2002, but then rejected his appeal regarding his competency to stand trial in January of this year. U.N. safeguards issued in 1984 prohibit death sentences for mentally ill persons. In 2002, as in preceding years, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution that called upon states not to impose the death penalty on """"a person suffering from any form of mental disorder."""" Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances. The death penalty is a form of punishment unique in its cruelty and is carried out in an arbitrary manner, inflicted primarily on the most vulnerable - the poor, the mentally ill, and persons of color.

Police in Durban yesterday opened water cannons on some 70 peaceful demonstrators who were urging the government to provide antiretroviral treatment for persons living with HIV/AIDS. This attack took place on the eve of South Africa's Human Rights Day, established in memory of the victims of apartheid-era atrocities. """"There is no justification for violence on the part of the authorities in the face of peaceful protest,"""" said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS Program of Human Rights Watch.

The organization Treatment Access Campaign (TAC) is leading a series of civil disobedience actions in a campaign called """"Dying for Treatment"""" that includes peaceful demonstrations near police stations. TAC's strategy is to send a few protestors into police stations to bring charges of manslaughter against key government officials who are alleged to have impeded access to life-saving treatment for people with AIDS, knowing that those who enter police stations to present these charges are likely to be arrested. It was after the presentation of these charges that police in Durban tried to disperse the demonstrators outside the station and, when they refused to disperse, used water cannons to clear the area. No arrests were reported in the Durban incident.  South Africa is home to about 5 million persons with AIDS. The government has repeatedly refused to provide antiretroviral treatment through government health programs and had to be taken to court in 2002 to be forced to provide even the short course of antiretroviral medicines that can reduce the risk of HIV transmission in childbirth, routinely provided in countries much more resource-strapped than South Africa.

In the past forty-eight hours, the number of detentions has risen to over eighty, according to Cuban human rights advocates. Many fear that the detainees will be tried under a 1999 law that carries sentences of up to twenty years. “The only crime committed by these prisoners is the promotion of ideas that are forbidden in Cuba,” said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. The Cuban government continues to restrict nearly all avenues of political dissent, strictly limiting the rights to freedom of expression, association, assembly, movement and of the press.

A federal appeals court ruled this month that U.S. courts have no jurisdiction over the claims of detainees held on the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba because the base is on sovereign Cuban soil. The decision confused legal fiction with reality. The mistake may prove costly not only to the Guantanamo detainees themselves, but to the rule of law worldwide. It is true that Guantanamo is land leased from Cuba. But a wiser court ruling would have acknowledged that Guantanamo is territory wholly under U.S. control; for all practical purposes, Cuban sovereignty is non-existent. Certainly U.S. officials would never acknowledge the jurisdiction of Cuban courts to hear claims brought by Guantanamo detainees. If the appellate decision is left standing, no court will be able to scrutinize how the U.S. treats its Guantanamo detainees. The world will nonetheless continue watching what the United States does with its prisoners. Under international law, U.S. officials are obliged to respect the rights of persons under their effective control wherever they are. International human rights treaties the United States has ratified do not permit it to violate rights simply because the violations occur in another country. The obligation to refrain from arbitrarily detaining people, for example, does not stop at national borders. Conditioning human rights on accidents of geography would render them meaningless. Nevertheless, the United States seems to believe the detainees at Guantanamo do not have any rights. It claims the unfettered discretion to hold without charges any non-citizen it labels as an enemy combatant for as long as it chooses. Unless the Supreme Court reverses yesterday's unfortunate decision, no court will tell it otherwise. Yet international law, including the Geneva conventions and international human rights treaties, provide clear benchmarks for determining whether and for how long the United States can hold the Guantanamo detainees. Any disinterested review of those laws suggests at least three categories of detainees at Guantanamo are now being held unlawfully. The first group are Taliban soldiers. As long as the war between Afghanistan and the United States continued, the Geneva Conventions permitted the United States to hold as prisoners without charges members of the Taliban government's armed forces. With that war having ended last June with the assumption of power of the Hamid Karzai government, the laws of war no longer permit the continued detention of those soldiers unless they are being prosecuted for war crimes or other offenses. They should be released and repatriated. The second group consists of civilians who unnamed U.S. intelligence officials cited in news reports claim were sent by mistake to Guantanamo. The laws of war permit the internment of civilians in a war only upon an individualized showing their detention is necessary for imperative reasons of security. If there are indeed civilians at Guantanamo who have no connection to the Taliban or Al Qaeda and who are not being prosecuted, they too must also be released. Finally, at least some suspected Al Qaeda members may have been brought to Guantanamo who were apprehended far from the war in Afghanistan. Six, for example, were picked up in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The laws of war do not apply to persons who were not picked up on a battlefield and who have no direct connection to an armed conflict. International human rights laws do apply - and they do not permit indefinite detention without charges or access to counsel. At risk at Guantanamo are not only the rights of individual detainees who are being detained unlawfully. If the United States is willing to toss aside the clear mandates of international law, it sends a green light to every other country to do the same. President Bush has repeatedly said that the war against terrorism is a war of values, a struggle to protect human dignity, human rights and the rule of law. At Guantanamo, that war is being lost..","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo"

Researchers also visited Diyana in Arbil province, the area designated by the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) authorities in December 2002 for the establishment of emergency shelters for displaced civilians. These three sites were supposed to hold up to 10,500 displaced persons. But, as of today, only one hundred tents had been erected with no functional sanitation facilities.  """"U.N. agencies had months to prepare for this potential disaster,"""" said Hania Mufti, a Human Rights Watch researcher based in Arbil. """"But today, we found local Kurdish relief workers desperately erecting tents in a muddy field outside the town of Diyana.""""  The potential disaster is made worse by the departure earlier this week of all foreign U.N. personnel and most foreign relief workers, who left only a skeletal local staff and no effective infrastructure in place.  In the days leading up to the outbreak of war, several thousand Iraqis fleeing government held areas crossed into the Kurdish-controlled region. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of civilians left their homes in major cities and towns in Kurdish areas because they feared chemical weapons attacks by the Iraqi military. These newly displaced Iraqis join the ranks of some 800,000 people who were already displaced in the north, from previous conflicts and as a result of ethnically-motivated forced displacement from oil-rich regions. Many of the new arrivals have sought shelter with relatives and friends in the countryside, while others have fled to makeshift camps in the mountainous region north of Arbil.  The World Food Program (WFP) has said that it has 36,000 metric tons of food in northern Iraq, stocked in warehouses in Arbil, Sulaymaniyah and Dohuk. The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) has said that it has relief items for 55,000 people in Iraq.  Yet the newly arriving displaced people in Arbil province have stretched the capacities of local Kurdish authorities. These authorities have no means to provide adequate housing, food, medical and sanitary facilities for the internally displaced. Any further influx of Iraqi civilians into Kurdistan or further displacement within the Kurdish region will create a humanitarian disaster.  Reports from the IFRC indicate that lack of shelter may be one of the most serious concerns. According to the IFRC's appeal dated March 20, 2003, the agency has only 2,000 tents on hand to service the entire country of Iraq. Preparations by the Turkish Red Crescent in northern Iraq have also been slow.  Up to 1,000 displaced civilians who have no relatives to seek shelter with have been relocated to Diyana where they are today being housed in local schools or with town residents. """"Without the assistance of the residents of Diyana and the local authorities, these displaced people would be living in far worse conditions,"""" Mufti said.  Displaced families told Human Rights Watch they had no form of heating in the schools and that their only food was provided by townspeople. Diyana's medical facilities are inadequate to cope with the needs of the displaced.  Over the past week, Human Rights Watch has interviewed Iraqis fleeing several cities and towns in Iraqi controlled areas, including Kirkuk, Mosul, Tikrit, Al Ramadi, and Baghdad. Many said they feared the war and were seeking refuge. Others who had fled the cities of Mosul and Kirkuk said the immediate reason for their flight was an Iraqi government campaign, particularly in Kurdish communities, of arrest of males of military age between fifteen and forty-five. They expressed fears that the campaign was intended to conscript men to serve in the armed forces and that they would be sent to the frontlines as expendable targets ahead of Iraqi troops.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq",""

""""The offer of exile for a dictator may make sense, if that is a way of avoiding war,"""" said Steve Crawshaw, London director of Human Rights Watch. """"But guaranteed immunity from prosecution can never be an option. Jack Straw's offer to Saddam is the worst possible birthday gift for the International Criminal Court.""""     Jack Straw's offer of immunity for Saddam Hussein comes only days after the first 18 judges were inaugurated at the newly created International Criminal Court. A single court can now for the first time bring to justice, serious war criminals and those who commit crimes against humanity, all over the world. The United States is strongly opposed to the court, which has 89 members including almost all the world's major democracies. Britain has declared itself to be a strong supporter.     """"This offer by Jack Straw sends a disastrous signal by suggesting that one of the most heinous criminals in the world can be definitively let off the hook,"""" said Crawshaw. """"Now that International Criminal Court exists, accountability is not a negotiable issue - not for Saddam, nor for any tyrant in the world. No ifs, no buts.""""     The jurisdiction of the court runs from July 1, 2002, and thus will not directly affect some of Saddam Hussein's worst documented crimes. It is, however, regrettable that Britain appears ready to set a precedent, which implies that crimes against humanity can be set to one side, when it suits the governments of the Security Council to do so.     In a previously published paper Human Rights Watch analyzed and made recommendations for justice in Iraq. It emphasized that the number of prosecutions of serious war criminals should not be kept artificially low, for political convenience. The paper also argued against using military tribunals, with the danger that such tribunals could be perceived as """"victors' justice.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United Kingdom, Iraq","International Justice, International Criminal Court"

All warring parties should abide by their obligations to protect Iraq’s civilians from the hazards of war, Human Rights Watch urged.  “The intense international debate surrounding this war means the conduct of the United States and its allies will be under unprecedented international scrutiny,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Saddam Hussein has a long record of war crimes, but that does not lessen the obligations of Iraq’s enemies in wartime.”  Drawing upon its experience of monitoring previous conflicts – including the 1991 Gulf War, NATO interventions in the Balkans, and the 2001 war in Afghanistan – Human Rights Watch highlighted the following concerns:  No party to the conflict should use chemical, biological or nuclear weapons of mass destruction under any circumstances, be it in first strike or reprisal. Iraq must not use human shields, but if it does, U.S. and allied forces must still assess the potential harm to civilians and take all feasible precautions in carrying out such attacks. In the event of urban warfare, all warring parties must provide adequate warnings and escape routes to civilians. The United States and its allies must not attack dual-use targets - such as electricity supply, food stocks and infrastructure - that are essential to the survival of the civilian population. Other dual-use targets should, insofar as possible, only be incapacitated, not destroyed. The letter noted the trend in recent conflicts such as Kosovo and Afghanistan away from attacking such targets. U.S. forces and their allies must make every effort to correctly identify targets before they are attacked. The letter highlighted patterns from previous conflicts in which mobile targets, such as convoys, were often misidentified due to poor intelligence and safeguards. The United States and its allies should only use precision-guided munitions in populated areas. Cluster bombs should not be used in populated areas, nor antipersonnel landmines under any circumstances. The letter highlighted the unacceptably high failure rate of cluster bombs and the indiscriminate effect on civilians of unexploded bomblets and antipersonnel landmines. Facilitate the surrender of enemy troops and treat prisoners of war fully in accordance with the Geneva Conventions. The letter also stressed the importance of ensuring the protection of prisoners taken by local groups, for instance Kurdish forces, noting the deaths of hundreds of Taliban prisoners in the custody of Northern Alliance forces in the wake of fighting in Afghanistan. The United States and its allies have a special responsibility to prevent abuses by allied local groups, protect and provide for civilians in occupied territory, and ensure the safety of refugees and the internally displaced. Humanitarian agencies must be given secure and unimpeded access to vulnerable populations. Human Rights Watch stressed that the United States and its allies must ensure prompt investigation of any allegations that their forces have committed war crimes or other abuses.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Australia, United Kingdom, Iraq","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/18/uzbekistan-new-strategy-ebrd","Uzbekistan- New Strategy from EBRD","Uzbekistan: New Strategy from EBRD","Tashkent Must Meet Benchmarks","03/18/2003","The Uzbek government should make urgent progress in meeting the specific benchmarks in human rights set by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in its new country strategy for Uzbekistan, Human Rights Watch said today. “The Bank has made clear that it expects reforms in exchange for engagement,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “The ball is now in Karimov’s court, and the international community is watching closely what steps are taken as a result.” In its strategy, published on March 16, the EBRD found that Uzbekistan’s progress toward democracy and human rights remained “slow and characterized by setbacks.” It flagged “[s]ystematic violations of the freedom of religion, expression, association and assembly,” and “arbitrary arrests and torture of detainees in order to obtain confessions or incriminating statements.” It further noted that the renewed interest on the part of the international community in Central Asia following September 11, 2001 was “a good opportunity for the country to accelerate political and economic reforms,” which the Uzbek government had “failed to use effectively.” The strategy concluded that “Uzbekistan needs to take a number of critical steps to put the country on a path of sustained progress,” and set specific benchmarks for the government to fulfill, including: Greater political openness and freedom of the media; Registration and free functioning of independent civil society groups; and Improvements of the country’s human rights record, including through implementation of the recommendations issued earlier this month by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture following his country visit to Uzbekistan in late 2002. The strategy specifies that the EBRD will conduct a thorough progress review in a year, and makes clear that “[s]hould no progress be made in these areas, the scope for new investments in Uzbekistan during the strategy period, both in the private and public sector, will be limited.” The adoption of a new country strategy for Uzbekistan comes at a critical moment for the Bank’s engagement with the country, less than two months before it is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. The Bank has faced significant criticism for its decision to grant the Uzbek government, among the most repressive in the region, the political prestige and financial benefits attached to hosting a high-level gathering of the kind that its annual meetings represent. A broad NGO campaign launched last May by Human Rights Watch and over fifty partners has been calling on the EBRD to use the leverage provided by the meeting to press for concrete progress in human rights in advance of it. In previous months, the EBRD had been reluctant to use benchmarks to put pressure on the Uzbek government. Just weeks before the meeting, that now seems to have changed. “Finally we see a public acknowledgment by the Bank that things are seriously wrong in the country,” said Andersen. “While welcome, a lot of valuable time has been lost due the Bank’s refusal to use the momentum of the run-up period to extract concrete progress in human rights. Setting these same benchmarks a year ago and attaching them to the annual meeting would obviously have been far more effective.” The Bank and its shareholders will now have to work hard to make up for the time lost and help ensure that the meeting – and their engagement with Uzbekistan overall – serve to promote human rights and democracy in the country. “It is crucial that the momentum not get lost after the meeting is over,” said Andersen. “We will be monitoring the process closely, to make sure the Bank remains serious about its commitment and conducts a serious review when the year is up.” In a letter to the EBRD Board of Directors in advance of its discussion of the country strategy, Human Rights Watch and CEE Bankwatch urged it to ensure that the strategy gives an adequate assessment of the situation on the ground, calls for specific improvements in human rights, and links these reforms to the upcoming annual meeting in May.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","World Bank, IMF"

Human Rights Watch released a new briefing paper today warning against the use of cluster bombs in Iraq.   Documents from the Kuwait Ministry of Defense show that 2,400 explosive cluster munition duds were found and destroyed in Kuwait in 2002, and a similar number the previous year.  """"The use of cluster munitions in Iraq will endanger civilians for years to come,"""" said Mark Hiznay, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and author of the new briefing paper. """"Cluster bombs also threaten U.S. and friendly soldiers during combat.""""  Human Rights Watch has issued detailed analyses of the U.S. use of cluster bombs in the Persian Gulf War, in Kosovo, and in Afghanistan.  During the 1991 Gulf War, the United States and its allied coalition dropped bombs containing about twenty million submunitions, and also reportedly fired artillery projectiles containing more than thirty million submunitions. These resulted in millions of hazardous duds, each functioning like an indiscriminate antipersonnel landmine.  At least eighty U.S. casualties during the war were attributed to cluster munition duds. More than 4,000 civilians have been killed or injured by cluster munition duds since the end of the war.  Human Rights Watch called attention to four particular types of U.S. cluster munitions that have had high failure rates in combat or in testing:  The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) with M77 submunitions has had a failure rate of 16 to 23 percent. Each standard volley of twelve MRLS rockets would likely result in more than 1,200 explosive duds.  155mm Dual Purpose Improved Conventional Munition (DPICM) artillery projectiles with M42 and M46 submunitions have had a failure rate of 14 percent. Rockeye CBU-99/CBU-100 air-dropped bombs with Mk 118 submunitions. This Vietnam-era cluster munition was used extensively in the 1991 Gulf War and has accounted for a very large percentage of the explosive duds subsequently encountered. Almost 20 percent of the cluster munition duds found in Kuwait in 2002 were from Rockeye bombs.  The CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition with BLU-97 submunitions had a failure rate of at least 7 percent in Yugoslavia and Kosovo in 1999. More than 10,000 air-dropped CBU-87s with more than 2 million submunitions were used in the Gulf War; more than 1,000 with over 200,000 submunitions were used in Afghanistan. The United States has cluster munitions containing more than one billion submunitions in current stockpiles, including more than 434 million 155mm DPICM artillery submunitions and more than 309 million MLRS rocket submunitions.  Human Rights Watch has called for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions until the humanitarian problems are addressed. Short of that commitment, Human Rights Watch urges that the United States, United Kingdom, and others that may deploy cluster munitions in Iraq take the following steps:  Prohibit the use of any cluster munitions in attacks on or near populated areas; Suspend use of and withdraw cluster munitions that have been tested and identified as producing high dud rates;  Refrain from using or transferring out-of-date types of cluster munitions in an effort to """"clean the closet"""" of stockpiles;  Record, report, track, and mark known or suspected cluster munition strike areas; and,  Preserve this information so it can be disseminated quickly in clearance efforts.","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

Based on experiences in the Persian Gulf War in 1991, Yugoslavia/Kosovo in 1999, and Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002, these dangers are both foreseeable and preventable. Cluster munitions cannot be targeted with precision. They cause damage over a very large and imprecise area, and, due to the numbers used and high failure rate, leave behind a great many unexploded """"dud"""" submunitions that become de facto antipersonnel landmines. Human Rights Watch has called for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions until these humanitarian problems are addressed. Environmental factors in parts of Iraq such as sand, wind, and marshes would likely contribute to producing even higher dud rates for submunitions. This briefing paper identifies four types of U.S. cluster munitions in particular that have produced large numbers of hazardous duds during previous combat operations and during testing. These four cluster munitions are currently in the inventory of the United States, United Kingdom, and other nations. This paper also provides details about the use of cluster munitions in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, including the threat to U.S. forces from their own weapons, and the ongoing impact of the resulting explosive dud submunitions. Human Rights Watch has recently obtained startling information showing that eleven years after the end of the war, about 200 hazardous cluster munition duds are still found and destroyed each month in Kuwait.

In today's ruling, the Court of Cassation effectively reversed the convictions handed down against the defendants in two earlier State Security Court trials on charges that included defaming Egypt, accepting European Union funding without permission, and forging electoral documents. A full verdict detailing the court's reasoning is expected in approximately one week.  """"The high court's decision demonstrates that Egypt's independent judiciary can deliver something like justice when confronted with trumped up charges and unfair procedures,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government would do well to reconsider any further use of the state security court system, which is hopelessly tainted by its politicized nature.""""  The government arrested Saadeddin Ibrahim and twenty-seven others and closed the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies in June 2000. At the time, the center was working on a voter education project in anticipation of national elections in October and November 2000. In May 2001, Ibrahim and six others were convicted and sentenced to prison in a State Security Court trial that the Cassation Court voided on procedural grounds. The government chose to prosecute the defendants in a second trial that also resulted in convictions in July 2002. The Court of Cassation quashed this verdict in December 2002 on procedural grounds, leading to a third trial before the high court itself that for the first time addressed the merits of the government's charges.  Human Rights Watch said that the charges against the Ibn Khaldun defendants were designed to silence critics of the government and that the earlier trials were manifestly unfair at all stages of the proceedings.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

Police detained Arthur Sakunts, leader of the Vanadzor branch of the Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly (HCA), the day after the organization’s office was firebombed. The HCA of Vanadzor, a town in northern Armenia, fielded observers in the recent presidential election, and planned a public meeting on March 15 to protest alleged poll violations. The arson attack and arrest followed growing pressure on the organization from the local authorities.  “Arthur Sakunts should be freed immediately and unconditionally,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “The arson attack on his office, and police abuse of their powers should be the focus of investigation—not a man who is advocating for Armenian voters’ rights.”  Sakunts is the first human rights defender to be arrested in the wave of arrests following the February 19 first round and March 5 runoff presidential elections. Victims of arrests, intimidation and punitive job dismissals to date have been either members of the political opposition, their relatives, or bus drivers who ferried people to opposition rallies.  In the early morning of March 14, an unknown party broke a glass panel in the entrance door of the Vanadzor HCA office and threw into it an incendiary device. Neighbors alerted the fire brigade to the flames and smoke. The fire was extinguished before it reached the main part of the office. The entry hall and ceiling were damaged.  The mayor of Vanadzor attempted to ban the HCA’s March 15 demonstration, citing a decree he issued in 2002, authorizing him to regulate public gatherings. However, an appeals court ruled the decree invalid, after a legal challenge brought last year by Sakunts.  At midday on Saturday March 15, up to fifty people assembled outside the HCA Vanadzor office, under the slogan “Defend Your Vote.” Police dispersed the gathering and led Sakunts away, supposedly to have a discussion with the local police chief.  In a practice that has become common in recent weeks, the informal “discussion” with Sakunts was transformed into police detention on a public order misdemeanor charge, under Armenia’s controversial, Soviet-era Code of Administrative Offenses. After a brief hearing, a court sentenced Sakunts to ten days of administrative detention.  Human Rights Watch and the Vanadzor HCA had planned joint research on the abusive practice of administrative detention. Armenian authorities use administrative detention to punish and intimidate demonstrators and political activists, and use it in more routine police work to circumvent due process guarantees for criminal suspects.  Post-election rallies have continued in support of Stepan Demirchian, who was defeated by incumbent president Robert Kocharian the March 5 runoff, which was marred by ballot stuffing and intimidation. Demirchian and Artashes Geghamian—a candidate who placed third in the first round—are each contesting the election results in the Armenian Constitutional Court.  Several opposition activists have reported to Human Rights Watch more police visits to their homes within the last week, with invitations to “discussions” with their local police chief.  Yesterday morning police also arrested at least two groups of opposition activists on the streets of central Yerevan. The activists were distributing leaflets announcing demonstrations to protest the March 15 arrest of Armen Sarkissian, brother of the head of the Hanrapetutiun (Republic) party, which is a key member of the opposition alliance supporting Demirchian. The arrests included:  Three students from the Hanrapetutiun youth wing—Vahan Babayan, and brothers Avetik and Rafik Ghazarian—reported arrested while leafleting near the Rossia cinema on Tigran Mets Street around 11:00 a.m. Ararat Maloyan, Vrej Ghazarian, and Artur Martirossian, whom police beat and detained on Yerevan’s Mashtots Avenue around 10:30 a.m. Within two hours of the detention, representatives of Human Rights Watch and the Armenian Helsinki Association went to the central district police precinct, the Yerevan City Police Department, and the central district court, in an attempt to locate the three, but the authorities denied holding them. Later in the day, it was reported that one of the three detainees telephoned relatives, informing them they were at the Yerevan City Police Department. Five of the six detainees were subsequently released.  Both Sarkissians are brothers of the late Vazgen Sarkissian, the prime minister who was assassinated in October 1999, together with Demirchian’s father, who at the time was speaker of parliament.  Sarkissian was arrested for alleged involvement in the December 2002 murder of Tigran Naghdalian, the head of Armenian public television. The government announced on March 5—runoff day—that it had detained several suspects, and pro-government newspapers indicated that the trail would lead to Armen Sarkissian.","Europe/Central Asia, Armenia",""

On March 13, the leadership of the Bar Association announced, after being received the previous day by Justice Minister Béchir Tekkari, that it would postpone until March 28 the start of a series of protest measures in order to test the government’s commitment to addressing its concerns.  Those concerns include the physical assaults by plainclothes police against several lawyers in December, and the failure of the courts to examine the complaint submitted by the Bar Association on behalf of the victims.  On March 10 the Bar Association had announced that the protest measures would start on March 13 and later culminate in public rallies, work stoppages, and a one-day strike.    The Bar Association is itself facing a politically motivated lawsuit.  It was filed in response to a successful one-day nationwide lawyers strike called in February 2002 by the Bar Association leadership to protest violations of defendants’ rights to a fair trial. The latest session in the Bar Association’s trial took place on February 25, 2003, and was attended by numerous observers, including one sent by Human Rights Watch. In addition, several lawyers are among those human rights activists whom plainclothes police keep under constant surveillance, a practice that violates the right to non-interference and privacy.  It also hurts the lawyers financially by scaring away potential clients. Most of the lawyers recently targeted are active in two new groups that authorities have refused to legally recognize, the Tunisian Center for an Independent Judiciary (Centre Tunisien pour l’Indépendance de la Justice, CTIJ) and the International Association for the Support of Political Prisoners (Association Internationale de Soutien aux Prisonniers Politiques, AISPP). Physical attacks on lawyers The recent spate of physical attacks on human rights lawyers began at 1:30 p.m. on December 11, 2002, when CTIJ founder Mokhtar Yahyaoui was about to enter the building on rue Charles de Gaulle in downtown Tunis that houses the law office of Noureddine Bhiri and of his wife Saïda Akremi.  Bhiri is a CTIJ executive committee member and Akremi is secretary-general of the AISPP. The aggressor, a heavy-set man in plainclothes, grabbed Yahyaoui and, shouting insults, dragged him around the corner where two other men were waiting.  Yahyaoui grabbed the iron grating of a storefront and screamed while the three men kicked and punched him.  The three assailants fled after a crowd began gathering.  Yahyaoui’s injuries, as documented later in a medical report, included bruised limbs and ankles and a bloody nose. This assault is not the first suffered by Yahyaoui. On April 5, 2002, after leaving a pro-Palestinian rally in Tunis, police forced him into a car without explanation and then, twenty kilometers from Tunis, dropped him off at the side of the road.1 Yahyaoui’s troubles began soon after he became the first sitting judge to speak out on the absence of independent judiciary in Tunisia.  In a July 6, 2001 open letter to President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, Yahyaoui, then president of the tenth chamber of the civil court of first instance of Tunis, wrote:  [judges] render verdicts dictated to them by political authorities and enjoy no discretion to exercise any objectivity or critical scrutiny….A class of opportunists and courtiers have taken complete control over the Tunisian justice system; they have come to constitute a veritable parallel justice system, one located outside all legal norms….Mr. President, your constitutional responsibilities oblige you to take decisions that bring about the removal of all interference with justice and with the institutions of the State…2  After issuing this open letter, Yahyaoui was subjected to anonymous threats, surveillance, travel restrictions, interruption of phone service, and other forms of harassment that intensified after he announced the creation of the CTIJ in December 2001. On December 29, 2001, the Judicial Disciplinary Council dismissed Judge Mokhtar Yahyaoui from the bench for “insulting the honor of the judiciary” and violating his “professional duties” and his “obligation of professional reserve.”  Yahyaoui’s appeal of his dismissal is pending before an administrative tribunal. On December 10, 2002, the day before the most recent assault against him, Yahyaoui had signed a communiqué urging an end to the long-term solitary confinement of twenty-three political prisoners, some of whom had been held in isolation for over ten years.  Yahyaoui had signed the appeal on behalf of the AISPP, which he had co-founded a month before. On December 13, plainclothes policemen assaulted a number of lawyers at the entrance to the building that houses the Bhiri-Akremi law office. The identity of the assailants was apparent from the manner in which they operated openly and in large numbers, singling out lawyers for attack or for barring entry to the building.  They did so for a couple of hours, in the middle of a workday and on a busy downtown street, without triggering the intervention of uniformed police.  Bhiri and Akremi were themselves beaten as they were getting out of their car in front of the building, in the company of their two children.  The youngest boy, who is thirteen years-old, was hit in the face.  Akremi was taken in an unmarked car to a police station and held several hours for questioning before being released. Plainclothes policemen also beat AISPP member Lassad Jouhri, who was present at the building.  He was treated later that day at Habib Thameur Hospital for his injuries, as noted in a medical report. Jouhri, an ex-prisoner who is disabled, had also been assaulted on August 28, 2002, when five men confronted him in downtown Tunis, broke one of his crutches and beat him with it. The men refused to identify themselves to Jouhri.  However, when ordering a uniformed policeman not to intervene, they identified themselves as security agents. On December 13, shortly after the detention of Akremi, plainclothes police also assaulted other lawyers who arrived at the building housing her office, including Abderraouf Ayadi, secretary general of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil National pour les Libertés en Tunisie, CNLT).  They later turned away lawyers who tried to reach the office after hearing about the morning’s events. These included Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (Ligue Tunisienne de défense des droits de l’Homme, LTDH) and Youssef Rezgui, president of the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers (Association Tunisienne des Jeunes Avocats, ATJA).  Rezgui was punched and slapped on the face, resulting, according to his medical report, in a perforated eardrum, loss of hearing, and cuts on the face. In separate incidents that day, two other founding members of the AISPP, lawyers Samir Ben Amor and Samir Dilou, were detained for several hours and questioned.  Dilou was beaten upon his arrest and later obtained a medical certificate confirming injuries consistent with blows to the head. The next day, police detained Yahyaoui and brought him to the Ministry of Interior, where he was held five hours for interrogation.  Yahyaoui said later that the questions focused on his activities within the AISPP.  The association remains legally “unrecognized” because authorities have prevented its founders from filing the papers required by the Law on Associations to obtain legal status.  Yahyaoui, Akremi, and the other founders tried on November 14, 2002, to file the papers, but the clerk at the office of the Tunis governorate (which is part of the Interior Ministry) refused to accept or issue a receipt for them, as the Law on Associations requires.3  On November 22, 2002, police detained for several hours the AISPP’s president, lawyer Mohamed Nouri, as well as Noureddine Bhiri and questioned them about the activities of the AISPP. The CTIJ also remains “unrecognized” fifteen months after Yahyaoui and its other founders encountered a similar refusal on December 26, 2001, by officials of the Tunis governorate, to accept the association’s constitutive papers and issue them a receipt. Tunisia’s two most prominent human rights organizations, the LTDH and the CNLT, are also in legal limbo.  On March 2, 1999, the interior minister rejected the CNLT’s effort to obtain legal recognition, stating only that the CNLT did not fulfill some of the conditions specified by the Law on Associations.  He did not elaborate or specify which conditions had not been met. The CNLT submitted an appeal on April 29, 1999, before an administrative court, pursuant to Article 5 of the Law on Associations. It has also remained active after declaring its “determination to exercise openly and serenely the freedom granted to it by the constitution of the Republic” and by international human rights instruments.4 In an interview published in Le Monde on April 6, 2001, then-Human Rights Minister Slaheddine Maâoui stated, “The CNLT applied in 1999 as an association, whereas its aims were those of a political party. So it received a refusal with an explanation.” But three years after the CNLT appealed the refusal it is still waiting for the administrative court to examine the case. Under Article 30 of the Law on Associations, persons convicted of participating in an “unrecognized” association are subject to sentences of one to five years in prison and a fine of between one hundred and one thousand dinars (the equivalent of about U.S. $60-600).  On December 30, 2000, Moncef Marzouki, a former CNLT spokesperson, was convicted of this charge along with spreading “false” information and given a one-year prison sentence, later reduced on appeal to a suspended sentence. The LTDH, for its part, is in defiance of a June 2001 appeals court order to nullify the election of its outspoken executive committee and hold new elections by June 2002.  The ruling was issued in response to a suit that – like the case filed against the Bar Association’s national council – was filed over procedural issues by members of the organization.  But the circumstances surrounding the lawsuits show that the government saw them as a means of curbing the newly-elected, independent-minded leaderships of both the LTDH and the Bar Association.5 The LTDH remains active.  While authorities have taken no steps to enforce the June 2001 court ruling against its executive committee, the ruling continues to hang over it. The Bar Association Defends against a Civil Suit and Files a Criminal Complaint On December 26, 2002, the national council of the Bar Association filed a criminal complaint on behalf of the lawyers who had been assaulted on December 13, as well as those, including Bhiri, Akremi, Nouri, and Radhia Nasraoui, whose offices are subject to constant surveillance, to the detriment of their business.  To date, no action has been taken on their complaint, logged under the court file number 7061799/2002. On February 16, 2003, the council convened a special session in Tunis to examine the latest developments.  It issued a resolution denouncing “vigorously the physical and other attacks perpetrated by members of the police against members of the legal profession” and protesting “against the refusal by the prosecutor’s office … to proceed with the complaint filed on December 26 on behalf of lawyers who were the victims of such attacks.” The association’s resolution called for “establishing a commission composed of the justice ministry, the Bar Association, and the Tunisian Human Rights League in order to conduct an inquiry into these assaults.” It also announced the intention to stage a graduated series of protests, starting with the wearing of red armbands and escalating to a rally of all lawyers in front of the justice ministry and a one-day work stoppage. The Bar Association’s relations with the government have been strained since the election as bar president on June 17, 2001, of Bechir Essid, a well-known opposition figure and ex-political prisoner.  Under his leadership, the association’s previous docility has given way to frequent denunciations of state-imposed obstacles to the ability of lawyers to mount an effective defense in political trials. After police used unprecedented strong-arm methods inside a courtroom during the trial of dissident Hamma Hammami and two codefendants on February 2, 2002, the Bar Association national council called a one-day nationwide protest strike for February 7, 2002.  The call to strike was adhered to by most of the 3,500 lawyers belonging to the Bar Association. The government reacted sharply to the strike.  At a press conference held on February 7, 2002, Justice Minister Béchir Tekkari said the strike was “illegal” and indicated that a number of lawyers were preparing a legal challenge to it. About the time that the justice minister made these remarks, six members of the Bar Association filed a civil suit asking the court to declare illegal the Bar Association’s strike call, on the grounds that it violated the Law Governing the Organization of the Legal Profession (Law 89-87 of September 7, 1989). The plaintiffs, most or all of whom are affiliated with the ruling Democratic Constitutional Rally party (Rassemblement Constitutionnel Démocratique, RCD), termed the strike a violation of their basic freedoms, including their right to work. They also said that one of their interests in the case was a desire to avoid sanctions that the Bar Association could impose on its members who defied a call to strike. Association President Essid has indicated publicly that the association had no intention of disciplining lawyers who did not follow the strike order.  The plaintiffs have nevertheless declined to drop their suit.  The plaintiff’s legal argument focuses on where the power resides for calling a lawyers strike. They maintain that Article 62 of Law 89-87 provides a list of the national council’s powers that is exhaustive.  Since the power to call a strike is not explicitly mentioned, that power must reside instead with the association’s general assembly. The complaint asked the court to rule that the national council of the Bar Association lacked the authority to declare a lawyers strike, a ruling that could undermine the power of the bar’s leadership. The national council has responded by pointing out that the powers enumerated in Article 62 are not exhaustive and that the right to strike had always been recognized as a prerogative of the council, as shown by the fact that no legal challenge had previously been mounted to strikes called by the council pursuant to Article 62.  The national council argues that the lawsuit is political in character, noting that the justice minister had announced that such a suit was in preparation. A Tunis appeals court scheduled the case for April 2, 2002. 6  At that hearing, the respondents obtained a postponement in order to prepare the defense.  Since then, the case has been postponed six more times, mostly if not always at the request of the plaintiffs.  On February 25, 2003, it was postponed until April 22. International observers have attended each hearing in the case. On February 25, 2003, observers attending the session included Paris judge Pierre Lyon-Caen on behalf of the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), the International Federation for Human Rights and Avocats sans Frontières; Thomas Braun representing the Brussels Bar Association; and Vincent Asselineau representing the Bar of Paris. Diplomats from the embassies of the United States, Great Britain, Switzerland, and the Netherlands were also present.  Human Rights Watch’s observer, Swiss attorney Alain Werner, spent two days in Tunis and attended the trial without encountering any obstacles to his work. Not all foreign observers have been granted access, however. The day before the hearing, authorities at Tunis-Carthage airport barred Dutch lawyers Jan Hofdÿk and Willem Van Manem from entering the country.  These two members of the Amsterdam bar had come to observe the trial.  A third lawyer from the Amsterdam bar, Bernadette Ficq, was allowed entry but decided to return home with her banned colleagues instead. In September 2002, some fifty Dutch lawyers had planned to fly together to Tunis in order to attend an earlier session of the trial, but authorities refused to permit their plane to land. Mokhtar Yahyaoui, meanwhile, remains banned from leaving the country.  On February 21, authorities refused to let him travel to Cairo to attend a conference organized for February 21-24 by the Arab Center for the Independence of the Judiciary and the Legal Profession.  Yahyaoui, who holds a valid passport, has been refused permission to travel since the Minister of Justice signed an order in November 2001 stating that, owing to the demands of his position as a judge, Yahyaoui could not absent himself from work in order to travel at that time.  Yahyaoui has since been prevented from leaving the country several times even though since December 2001 he has been relieved from his duties as a judge.  Recommendations Human Rights Watch urges the government of Tunisia to:  End the physical assaults on lawyers and human rights activists, and pursue vigorously the complaint filed by the Bar Association with the State Prosecutor on December 26, with the objective of identifying and prosecuting the perpetrators of the assaults that took place on December 11 and 13; Grant legal recognition to all human rights organizations whose application for legal status is pending, including the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia, the Center for the Independence of the Judiciary in Tunisia, and the International Association for Support of Political Prisoners; Lift the arbitrary travel ban on Mokhtar Yahyaoui and allow him, and all other Tunisian human rights defenders, to exercise their right to travel; Abide by the Declaration of the Right and Responsibility of Individuals, Groups and Organs of Society to Promote and Protect Universally Recognized Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on December 9, 1998, which states in Article 5:  For the purpose of promoting and protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, everyone has the right, individually and in association with others, at the national and international levels: To meet or assemble peacefully; To form, join and participate in nongovernmental organizations, associations or groups; To communicate with non-governmental or intergovernmental organizations.  Abide by the Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, 27 August to 7 September 1990, notably, Articles:  16. Governments shall ensure that lawyers (a) are able to perform all of their professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference; (b) are able to travel and to consult with their clients freely both within their own country and abroad; and (c) shall not suffer, or be threatened with, prosecution or administrative, economic or other sanctions for any action taken in accordance with recognized professional duties, standards and ethics. 23. Lawyers like other citizens are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. In particular, they shall have the right to take part in public discussion of matters concerning the law, the administration of justice and the promotion and protection of human rights and to join or form local, national or international organizations and attend their meetings, without suffering professional restrictions by reason of their lawful action or their membership in a lawful organization. In exercising these rights, lawyers shall always conduct themselves in accordance with the law and the recognized standards and ethics of the legal profession. 24. Lawyers shall be entitled to form and join self-governing professional associations to represent their interests, promote their continuing education and training and protect their professional integrity. The executive body of the professional associations shall be elected by its members and shall exercise its functions without external interference.   1 Plainclothes police have resorted to such short-term abductions previously against human rights defenders.  On December 15, 2000, they intercepted Omar Mestiri of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (Conseil National pour les Libertés en Tunisie, CNLT) as he and others were attempting to deliver a human rights petition to the Ministry of Public Health. They forced him into a car and dropped him outside the village of Mejaz el-Bab, some fifty kilometers from Tunis. 2 Under Tunisian law, Ben Ali, as president of the Republic, presides also over the High Judicial Council.  A French translation of Yahyaoui’s letter to him, which was written in Arabic, can be found in Avocats sans frontières and l’Observatoire pour la protection des défenseurs des droits de l’Homme (a joint program of the International Federation for Human Rights and the World Organization against Torture) “Tunisie: l’affaire Yahyaoui, le combat d’un homme pour l’indépendance de la justice,” May 2002, http://www.fidh.org/magmoyen/rapport/2002/tnobs04f.pdf [retrieved March 12, 2003]. 3 Article 3 of the Law on Associations (Law 59-154 of November 7, 1959, as amended) states that persons wishing to form an association must submit to the office of the governorate a statement containing various information about the association and its founders.  In return, a receipt is provided.  After depositing the documents, the new association is deemed to enjoy legal status unless the Ministry of Interior refuses it, with the motive provided, within three months. Thus, issuance of the dated receipt proves deposit of the documents and starts this three-month countdown. 4 See CNLT communiqué of May 31, 1999, “Pour l'abrogation de la loi sur les associations.” 5 See Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights, “Tunisia: A Lawsuit against the League, An Assault on All Human Rights Activists,” A Human Rights Watch Report, vol. 13, no.3(E), April 2001, http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/tunisia/index.htm [retrieved March 13, 2003]. 6 Law 89-87’s Article 71 provides that appeals of Bar Association decisions are to be heard before the Court of Appeals in the appropriate jurisdiction.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia","Free Speech"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/16/ukraine-informal-political-censorship","Ukraine- Informal Political Censorship","Ukraine: Informal Political Censorship","","03/16/2003","The Presidential Administration of Ukraine blatantly violates freedom of expression through explicit instructions on how television stations may cover the news, Human Rights Watch said in a report released today that included examples of these directives. The forty-eight page report, “Negotiating the News: Informal State Censorship of Ukrainian Television,” documents the impact of secret instructional memoranda, known as temniki (from the Russian phrase, temy nedeli [themes of the week]), on the practice of journalism in Ukraine. Prepared and distributed by the Presidential Administration to top managers and editors of national television stations, temniki delineate which news topics to cover and how to present them in broadcasts. Non-compliance invites a wide range of informal sanctions, including tax audits, license cancellation, arbitrary libel suits, demotions, and pay cuts.  “The Presidential Administration’s directives are an insidious form of censorship,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia Division. “Millions of viewers in Ukraine fail to receive important information about political, economic, and social developments,” said Andersen.  The report comes on the eve of the 2003 European Union-Ukraine Cooperation Council meeting, one of the most important annual gatherings between Ukraine and Europe.  Temniki have a strong coercive impact on news reporting in Ukraine. One pro-presidential perspective dominates television news broadcasts, the most widely used source of news in Ukraine. The activities and platforms of other political figures are distorted or ignored. The clearest example of this occurred during coverage of the September 16, 2002 opposition demonstrations, when stations aired strikingly similar reports and footage that failed to explain who was demonstrating, what their demands were, and the course the demonstrations took.  Threats of legal and administrative repercussions for non-compliance compel editors and journalists to fulfill the Presidential Administration’s guidelines. Even before the appearance of temniki, media outlets that supported opposition parties or failed to comply with official requests faced court challenges, arbitrary administrative inspections, and license withdrawals. Journalists have been demoted, dismissed, had their wages cut, and faced other negative consequences. While some journalists have quit their jobs to protest growing censorship, many continue to practice their profession under trying circumstances, resorting to self-censorship or reporting impartial news despite constant risks.  “Since the end of Soviet censorship, a certain degree of media pluralism has emerged in Ukraine,” said Andersen. “However, truly independent media outlets are quite rare.”  Economic instability has forced the majority of media to accept sponsorship and security from major industrial groups who have formed political parties and purchased media outlets. These patrons often use their media holdings as a mouthpiece for personal or group interests and opinions. Financial-political groups close to President Kuchma now dominate the six national television stations, and this, combined with the appearance of the temniki, has further eroded editorial and journalistic pluralism.  Informal censorship and economic dependence are not the only threats to media freedom in Ukraine. The “disappearance” and murder of oppositional journalist Heorhii Gongadze in September 2000 stirred domestic and international outcry over the threatening climate for journalists. The Gongadze case and other cases like it continue to remain unsolved. Kuchma and other prominent public officials have been implicated in the Gongazde murder, based on tape recordings of a meeting at which the president allegedly asked security officials to “take care” of the journalist.  To address the deteriorating media situation in Ukraine, Human Rights Watch called on the Ukrainian government to:  End immediately the distribution of temniki or any other form of coercive written or verbal instructions from the Presidential Administration to all media; Ensure that censorship by government authorities or private individuals in any form does not continue by enforcing existing laws and obligations that prohibit censorship; Conduct prompt and thorough investigations of government officials and others implicated in censorship or other abuses against members of the media and hold accountable those responsible; Consider introducing legislation to guarantee a realistic minimum wage for journalists and a regulatory framework to guarantee legal recourse for journalists facing retaliation in the form of salary cuts, demotions, or dismissal. Human Rights Watch called on the European Union to make media freedom a top priority in its relations with Ukraine and to require demonstrable improvements in Ukraine’s human rights as part of continued engagement. Human Rights Watch also urged the international community to promote media freedom in Ukraine, recommending that international organizations such as the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe continue to assist and monitor the Ukrainian government in securing freedom of expression.","Europe/Central Asia, Ukraine","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

It was this consensus that led the United Nations Security Council to create the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 1993. The authorities in the region have often resisted the jurisdiction of the ICTY, arguing that war criminals should be tried in national courts. Increasingly, the international community and the ICTY itself expect that national courts will try lower-level alleged war criminals, while the ICTY focuses on the most senior indictees and aims to wind up its activities by 2008. Shifting the burden to local courts will only be successful to the extent that local prosecutors have the will and means to prosecute these cases effectively, and the courts act independently and impartially in accordance with international fair trial standards. With its periodic Balkans Justice Bulletins, Human Rights Watch aims to assess whether these conditions exist, identify areas in which improvements are necessary, and make recommendations to national and international actors to achieve needed reform. Human Rights Watch takes no position as to the guilt or innocence of persons on trial. Introduction On January 20, 2003, the Belgrade district court began an important war crimes trial against four Serbs accused of kidnapping, torturing, and killing seventeen Muslims from Serbia in 1992. The crime occurred in an area of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by Bosnian Serbs, near the border with Serbia. As most of the victims had resided in the village of Sjeverin, in southwest Serbia, the trial is usually referred to as """"the Sjeverin trial."""" Hundreds of individuals responsible for war crimes committed during the wars in Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo live in Serbia and Montenegro, but as of January 2003, only four domestic war-crime trials had taken place, all since the departure of Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic from power in October 2000. Officials in Serbia have nonetheless asserted that war-crime perpetrators as a rule should be tried at home, rather than before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). In this context, the Sjeverin trial presents an important test of the Serbian justice system's ability to prosecute war crimes. During the first four days of the trialÑwhich reconvenes on March 17, 2003Ñthe court heard one of the accused, four prosecution witnesses, and eleven relatives of the victims who, although not witnesses to the crime of October 22, 1992, took the stand to testify about related events prior to and after the crime. When the trial reconvenes, the court is expected to hear additional witnesses proposed at the end of the fourth day by the prosecutor and the lawyers representing the families of the victims. The defense is expected to present their case at a later stage in the trial. Human Rights Watch monitored these first four days of the trial to assess the proceedings. These comments therefore reflect a preliminary assessment of the trial. We are hopeful, in part because of the prosecutor's relatively serious-minded presentation of the evidence, that the Sjeverin trial will represent an advance for Serbia's accountability efforts. However, in other significant waysÑnotably the lack of effective witness protection and the lack of cooperation among justice systems in the former Yugoslavia Ñthe first part of the trial has highlighted additional steps needed to improve the administration of justice in war-crimes cases. The Alleged Crime The Sjeverin indictment alleges that on October 22, 1992, during the armed conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina, members of a Serb """"paramilitary group"""" called Osvetnici (""""The Avengers""""), kidnapped seventeen ethnic Muslims in the village of Mioce, on the Bosnian side of the Bosnian-Yugoslav border. That same day, the perpetrators are charged with taking the victims to Visegrad in Bosnia, and torturing them in a motel. The group of Muslims were then allegedly taken to the nearby bank of the Drina River and beaten, before three of the accused allegedly fired upon them with automatic weapons. The indictment charges that those among the seventeen who were not killed outright were subsequently slaughtered with knives. Although by all accounts there were as many as a dozen persons involved in the killings, only four are being tried by the Belgrade court: Milan Lukic, Oliver Krsmanovic, Dragutin Dragicevic, and Djordje Sevic. Two of the accused are in custody and currently standing trial in Belgrade, while two of them remain at large and are being tried in absentia. The two on trial in Belgrade are Djordje Sevic, a citizen of Serbia and Montenegro, whom the Serbian police arrested in October 2002, and Dragutin Dragicevic, a Bosnian Serb arrested when he entered Serbia in April 2002. Lukic and Krsmanovic are the two being tried in absentia. Lukic, who is believed to be in hiding in eastern Bosnia, has also been indicted by the ICTY for other crimes committed in Visegrad, including the June 1992 mass murder of approximately 135 Bosnian Muslim civilians allegedly locked inside two houses that were set on fire. Krsmanovic reportedly lives openly in Visegrad, Bosnia, according to an interview with his wife published recently in Nezavisne, a credible newspaper from the Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka. The Serbian State Attorney accused the four defendants of a war crime against the civilian population, punishable under article 142 of the Yugoslav Penal Code. This article encompasses the prohibitions contained in the grave breaches provisions of the Geneva Convention (IV) relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (1949).2 Among other acts, article 142 prohibits the taking of hostages, unlawful confinement, torture, and killings of civilians, all of which allegedly occurred in this case.3 Sevic and Dragicevic pleaded not guilty. Dragicevic has to date exercised his right to remain silent, while Sevic has chosen to testify. Sevic has testified that during the kidnapping in Mioce he was unaware of the nature of the action and the ethnicity of the victims, and that he was not present in Visegrad when the torture and killings took place. Testimony presented during the first week of the trial detailed the crimes alleged in the indictment. According to this testimony, on October 22, 1992, seventeen Muslim nationals from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Montenegro) were traveling along with dozens of Yugoslavs of Serb ethnicity by bus to Priboj, a Serbian town where most of them were employed. The bus route included a stretch of a few miles through Bosnian territory. According to trial witnesses, a group of armed men in Mioce, Bosnia stopped the bus and forced off the Muslim passengers. Witnesses stated that the Serb passengers were permitted to proceed, while the armed men loaded the Muslims into the back of a truck and took them to Visegrad. On the way from Mioce to Visegrad, the armed men allegedly forced the victims to sing Serb nationalist songs. According to trial testimony, in Visegrad hundreds of citizens gathered in front of the """"Vilina vlas"""" motel and, later, near the Drina River. Some members of the assembled crowd also allegedly joined the accused in the beating and killing at the riverbank. Positive Developments in the Sjeverin Trial The first phase of the Sjeverin trial reflected certain improvements from past war-crimes trials in Serbia. The handful of previous trials suffered from poor preparation by the prosecution and procedural irregularities.4 The Sjeverin trial is the first war-crime trial to open in the capital Belgrade, and some of the positive developments detailed here may be attributable to this venue, where the judiciary is generally more professional and prosecutors, judges, and, arguably, witnesses too, are less likely to be intimidated. Some observers had expressed concern that in pursuing the Sjeverin case, the Serb authorities have an ulterior political aim to limit responsibility for the October 1992 crime to a small number of marginal individuals, instead of on the political and military leadership in Serbia and the Bosnian Serb entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This concern was heightened by the prosecutor's characterization of the perpetrators in the indictment as a """"paramilitary group,"""" suggesting that they were operating independently. While it is too early for a final assessment of the prosecution case, the early proceedings suggest that these concerns are unwarranted. In fact, during the first four days of the trial, the president of the trial chamber asked a number of questions aimed at clarifying whether the perpetrators were not """"paramilitaries,"""" but members of the Bosnian Serb army. It is hoped that the court will hear from witnesses who will be able to tell more about the role of the Bosnian Serb army and the Serbian authorities during and after the event, in order to shed light on the overall context and circumstances of the crime, and to examine the possible criminal liability of those who were in a position to prevent the commission of the crime. Another positive development from previous trials is that the state prosecutor has apparently gathered substantial evidence, including detailed witness testimonies and photographic evidence of the crime. This more comprehensive investigative effort would appear to reflect a welcome level of cooperation on the part of the Serbian police. Human Rights Watch does remain concerned that this cooperation between the police and the prosecution may be difficult to replicate in other cases: the Sjeverin case is unusual among war crimes committed in Serbia in that there appears to have been no Serbian police directly involved in the commission of the crime. By contrast, members of the police were often directly responsible for crimes in Kosovo, and the police have not to date facilitated prosecutorial investigations. As detailed below, among the positive aspects of the first phase of the trial have also been the ad hoc efforts by the court, the prosecutor, and the police to enhance witness protection in spite of the limited provision Serbian law makes for such measures. Notwithstanding the positive elements observed during the first phase of the Sjeverin trial, a series of potential obstacles related to witness protection, cooperation between states, and lack of resources could still prevent the court from providing a full account of the crime. The following discussion details these remaining challenges faced in the Sjeverin case and identifies steps for the government of Serbia and Montenegro to take to address these concerns in the Sjeverin trial and future national war-crime trials. Protection of Witnesses Successful prosecution of a war-crime case depends significantly on the availability and credibility of witnesses, which in turn requires that witnesses feel they can testify truthfully without fear of retribution. Unfortunately, the criminal procedural law in force in Serbia and Montenegro makes only limited provision for the protection of witnesses. The two provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act (2001) dealing with witness protection are cursory and inadequate.5 During the first stage of the Sjeverin trial, the prosecutor, the police, and the court improvised to achieve some degree of witness protection, but the proceedings highlighted a general need for more thorough-going witness protection mechanisms in the law and practice of Serbia and Montenegro. On January 21, 2003, the second day of the trial, a number of relatives of the victims testified. None of them had been present at the crime scenes, but some gave important testimony about the activities of defendant Milan Lukic's fighters just prior to and after the events of October 22, 1992. On the third day of the trial, prior to leaving Belgrade for the Serbian south or to Bosnia where some of these Muslim witnesses now live, they informally expressed concern about their safety to non-governmental trial monitors. The state prosecutor learned of their concern, and during the afternoon he arranged for the Serbian police to accompany the relatives of the victims to their final destination in Serbia and, for those traveling to Bosnia, to the border. The anxiety expressed by these witnesses may have been heightened by the fact that under Serbian criminal procedure law, the judge reads the address of the witness before examining him or her, and the Sjeverin trial did not deviate from this practice. Given the nature of the crimes at issue, as well as the fact that most of the perpetrators of war crimes during the Bosnian war are believed to be in Serbia, such disclosures unnecessarily expose witnesses to danger. The need to establish this sort of personal data about a witness can be satisfied through sealed written submissions to the court or an in camera examination of the witness by the judges, leaving undisclosed to the public sensitive information such as the witness' precise address. When a key witness for the prosecution was to testify on the fourth day of the Sjeverin trial, the state prosecutor asked in court that the session be closed for the safety of the witness. The Criminal Procedure Act, in a blatant omission, does not include witness safety among the grounds for closing a session. Instead the court invoked """"public order"""" as the legal basis for closing the session, which normally refers to substantial unrest, an unlikely concern here. The witness then testified in a session attended only by monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and non-governmental organizations. The witness ultimately received twenty-four-hour police protection before, during, and after his testimony, but these remain ad hoc arrangements rather than measures taken pursuant to a witness protection program defined by law. Thus the experience of the first phase of the Sjeverin trial highlighted the witness protection issues that such cases raise and the inadequacy of existing law and practice in Serbia and Montenegro. At a symposium on witness protection held in Belgrade in December 2002, a representative of the Serbian Ministry of Interior acknowledged that Serbia does not have a witness protection program that provides, for example, for witnesses to change identities, change residences, or arrange protection for family members. Moreover, the government lacks funds for such measures. Even in trials not related to war crimes, the official said that the lack of witness protection often causes witnesses to alter their testimony at the trial. A meaningful effort to achieve accountability through national war-crime trials in Serbia and Montenegro will require measures to protect witnesses prior to, during, and following trials, including through a long-term witness protection program or resettlement in another country.  The government of Serbia and Montenegro should as a matter of priority enact legislation authorizing and sufficiently funding meaningful witness protection measures. The government should seek technical and financial assistance from other states and intergovernmental organizations to support witness protection efforts.  Issues Regarding Cooperation Between States The Sjeverin trial illustrates the importance of cooperation between the countries in what was formerly Yugoslavia for achieving the successful prosecution of war crimes. Mechanisms for such cooperation have been lacking, which could hinder the prosecution's efforts in the Sjeverin trial. The lack of cooperation among the states of the former Yugoslavia has been first and foremost a function of a legal vacuum in this area. Domestic laws on criminal procedure for each of the jurisdictions provide the only formal rules on cooperation, because Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have no bilateral agreements governing judicial assistance in criminal matters, including extradition. Multilateral agreements such as the European Convention on Extradition and the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters cannot fill the legal void, because Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a party to either convention. (Serbia and Montenegro became a party to both conventions in December 2002.) Human Rights Watch learned from well-informed authorities in Belgrade and Sarajevo that negotiations on a bilateral agreement between the two states are ongoing and may be concluded this year, though likely too late to have any impact on the Sjeverin trial. As detailed below, the lack of clear rules providing for effective cooperation can be seen clearly in the Sjeverin case proceedings.  Cooperation and Extradition of Suspects The lack of cooperation among the states of the former Yugoslavia has to date ensured impunity for some alleged war criminals. As previously noted, two of the four Sjeverin indicteesÑMilan Lukic and Oliver KrsmanovicÑremain at large in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and are being tried in absentia in the on-going Belgrade proceedings. Such trials in absentia raise concerns about respect for the defendants' fair trial rights and the governments in the region should work together to bring the two at-large defendants to justice. Bosnian law prohibits extradition of Bosnian nationals, so unless the two leave the territory of Bosnia and are arrested, only a Bosnian court can try them. Unfortunately, Republika Srpska, the Serb-controlled entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina where Lukic and Krsmanovic reside, has demonstrated no commitment to accountability for wartime atrocities and has yet to try a single Bosnian Serb on war-crimes charges. Continued impunity for crimes such as those with which Lukic and Krsmanovic are charged should not be tolerated. To address this problem, Human Rights Watch recommends:  Bosnia and Herzegovina should promptly accede to the European Convention on Extradition. In accordance with the European Convention on Extradition, if either of the two states exercises its right not to extradite its nationals, the requested state should at the request of the requesting state submit the case to its competent authorities in order that domestic criminal proceedings may commence, if appropriate. The international community, particularly the Council of Europe and the European Union, should highlight the importance of judicial cooperation as a precondition for the continued integration of these states into European institutions.  Pending the development of an extradition regime between the two states, the authorities of Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina should work within existing legal frameworks to bring Lukic and Krsmanovic to justice. Specifically, regarding the case against Krsmanovic, Human Rights Watch recommends that:  The District Court in Belgrade should request the Yugoslav police to issue an international warrant for the arrest of Krsmanovic through Interpol, in order to prevent Krsmanovic's departure from Bosnia and Herzegovina. (The Interpol office in Belgrade declined to answer the Human Rights Watch request for information on whether an arrest warrant against Krsmanovic exists.) The District Court in Belgrade should request that Bosnia and Herzegovina take over the prosecution of Krsmanovic. As part of its request for deferral of prosecution, or after receiving notification from the prosecutor in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the court in Belgrade should submit the relevant judicial records regarding the Krsmanovic case to the Bosnian prosecutor. Following receipt of a deferral request and documentation from the adjudicating court in Belgrade, the competent prosecutorial office in Bosnia and Herzegovina should promptly order the arrest of Oliver Krsmanovic and take over the prosecution. As a practical matter, this would mean that the trial could begin only after the ICTY prosecutor approves local prosecution, in accordance with the so-called """"Rules of the Road,"""" which govern the division of labor between the Bosnian judiciary and the ICTY.6     The other indictee, Milan Lukic, has been in hiding in an attempt to avoid arrest, under the ICTY indictment against him, by the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia.  Republika Srpska police, working together with SFOR troops if necessary, should promptly arrest Lukic and surrender him to the custody of the ICTY.  Cooperation and Witness Testimonies The availability of pertinent evidence, especially witness testimony, is another area in which the lack of cooperation between Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina can be seen in the Sjeverin trial. The statements of one of the accused (Sevic) and some witnesses who testified during the first week of the trial suggest that numerous civilians and uniformed individuals from Visegrad and the surrounding area witnessed the torture and killings on October 22, 1992. Ideally in this context, the Belgrade prosecutor or investigating judge and their counterparts in Republika Srpska would have from the beginning of their investigation worked closely together or set up a joint investigation team, in order to identify and locate witnesses. To our knowledge, this has not been the case. The prosecutor has not to date called any of these witnesses to testify. To address these concerns, Human Rights Watch recommends:  The Belgrade prosecutor should establish cooperation with his counterparts in Republika Srpska. Specifically, for purposes of the Sjeverin case, the Belgrade prosecutor should seek assistance in obtaining testimony of Bosnian witnesses. While Bosnian nationals are under no legal obligation to appear before a court in Serbia and Montenegro, they could be encouraged to testify in the case. Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina should conclude a bilateral agreement that expressly provides for judicial cooperation. Bosnia and Herzegovina should promptly accede to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. Governments in the territory of the former Yugoslavia should, with the possible technical and financial support of international donors, facilitate testimony of witnesses from other jurisdictions by video conference.  Additional Areas for Improvement: In addition to the need for improved witness protection and inter-state judicial cooperation, Human Rights Watch identified several other measures that would strengthen the Sjeverin and other national war-crime proceedings.  Photographic Evidence Display While the primary purpose of the Sjeverin trial is of course to adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the accused, the proceedings can also play an important role in raising the awareness of the Serb public to the crimes committed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, by making the evidence presented more available to the public. Unfortunately, in this regard, some of the most important evidence offered by the prosecutor during the first four days of the trialÑphotographs of the perpetrators and victims taken on the day of the crimeÑwas inaccessible to the public observing the proceedings. During these proceedings, the accused and the victims were asked on a number of occasions to approach the bench and say whether they could identify the persons in these photographs. The public and the media were unable to see this visual material, because there was no slide projector in the room. Human Rights Watch recommends:  The court should install a slide-projector or other mechanism for displaying photographic evidence in the courtroom. Generally they should endeavor to present the evidence in the trial in a manner that makes it as accessible to the general public as possible, consistent with the rights of the victims, witnesses, and the accused.     Monitoring by Foreign Observers As the international community increasingly looks to domestic courts in the former Yugoslavia to take on a larger burden of the post-war accountability effort, it has a significant stake in seeing those proceedings be efficient, effective, and fair. To this end, the U.S. government has recently announced that it will be developing a significant aid package for judicial reform in Serbia and Montenegro. Against this backdrop, other governments and intergovernmental organizations should make a priority of monitoring domestic war-crime trials, including the Sjeverin trial. Only after closely observing the trials can governments arguing for deferral of war-crime cases from the ICTY to national courts be in a position to make a qualified judgment on the existence, or lack thereof, of conditions warranting such deferral. Trial monitoring would also inform efforts to develop an appropriate program of judicial assistance for governments in the region. And finally, the presence of the observers would provide an additional incentive to the prosecutor and the trial chamber to perform their work properly. Unfortunately, during the first four days of the Sjeverin trial, no representatives of intergovernmental organizations or foreign governments were observed in the courtroom.  Human Rights Watch calls on the staff of intergovernmental organizations and foreign embassies in Belgrade to attend the hearings in the Sjeverin trial and other war- crime trials that might follow.     Comprehensive Investigation of the Crime Although in the Sjeverin trial the prosecutor has produced more evidence than has been standard in previous war-crime trials in Serbia and Montenegro, most observers agree that the prosecutor could have proposed a more exhaustive list of witnesses. This might have included: Serb passengers from the bus who witnessed the kidnapping; the only Muslim survivor from the bus; the commander of the Visegrad brigade in the Bosnian Serb army; civilians from Visegrad; the Serbian police and investigating judge from the Serbian town of Uzice, near the border with Bosnia, where Milan Lukic was arrested and subsequently released in October 1992 in relation to the incident; and municipal and police officials in Priboj, the Serbian town where the bus arrived after the kidnapping. While the prosecutor's access to some of these witnesses may have been limited by the lack of cooperation with Bosnian authorities detailed above, many of them may be available to him. In the remaining part of the trial the prosecutor and the representatives of the victims' families have an opportunity to propose additional witnesses.  Human Rights Watch urges the prosecutor to seek all witnesses with information relating to the Sjeverin crimes. The prosecutor should present all relevant evidence so obtained to the court in the current trial, and bring any additional indictments this evidence might support.  1 The former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising six republics, disintegrated in 1991 and 1992, when five independent states were formed: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Macedonia, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (comprised of Serbia and Montenegro). In February 2003, the residual two-member Yugoslav federation became a loose union under a new name, Serbia and Montenegro. 2 See the Fourth Geneva Convention, art. 147. 3 Krivicni zakon Savezne Republike Jugoslavije, preciscen tekst (Penal Code of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, redacted text) [1976], (Pravno istrazivacki centar, Belgrade, 2001), art. 142. 4 The trial of Sasa Cvjetan had to be transferred from the southern town of Prokuplje to Belgrade, after the presiding judge and prosecutor faced acts of intimidation, apparently by the supporters of the defendant, a member of the Serbian special police. The trial recommenced in Belgrade on March 12, 2003. 5 Article 109(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that """"At the proposal of the investigating judge or the president of the chamber, the president of the court or the state prosecutor may request that the organs of internal affairs take necessary measures to protect the witness or the injured party."""" In December 2002, a new chapter was added to the Criminal Procedure Act, dealing exclusively with the prosecution of individuals involved in organized crime. As part of the chapter, article 504 (p) states the following: """"State prosecutor may order that special protection be secured for the witness, witness-collaborator, or members of their families."""" Quoted from Zakonik o krivicnom postupku, sa izmenama i dopunama (Criminal Procedure Act, with Amendments) [2001], (Sluzbeni list, Belgrade, 2002) (unofficial translation). 6 Under the Rules of the Road agreement, concluded in 1996 in Rome by the signatories of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement, the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina cannot proceed with a war crimes prosecution unless the ICTY Prosecutor had verified that the evidence supports reasonable doubt that the suspect committed a gross violation of international humanitarian law.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

In the aftermath of the March 12 assassination of Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic, Human Rights Watch underscored the importance of credible national efforts to hold war criminals accountable, some of whom are believed linked to the Djindjic murder.  The trial concerns four Serbs accused of kidnapping, torturing, and killing seventeen Muslims from Serbia on October 22, 1992. The case, often referred to as the “Sjeverin case,” after the town where most of the victims lived, commenced with an initial four days of hearings in late January. Human Rights Watch’s report is one in a series of “Balkans Justice Bulletins” aimed at assessing the efforts of national authorities to hold war criminals accountable. Serbia has to date held only four war-crime trials, but the Belgrade authorities have long argued that war criminals should be tried in national courts instead of before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in the Hague, an approach increasingly embraced by a number of other governments as well. The ICTY has said that it would like to try only senior-level war criminals, leaving trial of lower level perpetrators to the judiciaries in the region.  “Previous war-crime trials in Serbia and Montenegro have been few in number and seriously flawed,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “These cases are the litmus test for the rule of law in Serbia and Montenegro, an opportunity to break with the kind of horrible violence witnessed in Belgrade this week.” Andersen said that in the first phase of the Sjeverin trial there were some positive signs, coupled with areas of continued concern that should be addressed as the trial reconvenes.  Human Rights Watch said that compared to past war-crime trials, the state prosecutor in this case seems to have assembled a stronger case, apparently benefiting from better cooperation from the Serbian police. Human Rights Watch cautioned, however, that this cooperation could be difficult to replicate in other war-crime cases that—in contrast to the Sjeverin case—implicate the police in the commission of the crime.  Among the positive aspects of the first phase of the trial, the president of the trial chamber asked a number of questions aimed at clarifying that the perpetrators were regular members of the Bosnian Serb army, not free-lancing paramilitaries.  Human Rights Watch also welcomed efforts by the court and prosecutor to protect vulnerable witnesses, but urged the development of a more systematic, properly funded witness protection program. The Criminal Procedure Act of Serbia and Montenegro contains only two very brief and general provisions addressing witness protection. Serbia does not have a witness protection program enabling witnesses, for example, to change identities, change residences, or arrange protection for family members. Even in trials not related to war crimes, the lack of witness protection often causes witnesses to alter their testimony at the trial.  Human Rights Watch said the first phase of the case had also highlighted serious gaps in cooperation between the authorities of Serbia and Montenegro and their counterparts in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Two of the indictees, Dragutin Dragicevic and Djordje Sevic, pleaded not guilty on the opening day of the trial. The remaining two indictees, Milan Lukic and Oliver Krsmanovic, are believed to be at large in Bosnia, and are being tried in absentia by the Belgrade court. Lukic is also wanted by the ICTY.  Human Rights Watch said that trying Lukic and Krsmanovic in absentia raises concerns about their fair trial rights and pressed for the governments in the region to work together to bring them to account. Such efforts are complicated because Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnia and Herzegovina have no bilateral agreements governing judicial assistance in criminal matters.  Human Rights Watch called for an international arrest warrant to prevent the two from fleeing Bosnia, and also urged the Serbian court to request that the Bosnian authorities take over the prosecution of Krsmanovic and try him in accordance with international standards. At the same time, Human Rights Watch called on the authorities of the Republika Srpska (the majority Serbian entity of Bosnia) to arrest Lukic and transfer him to the ICTY. Andersen said that the authorities in Belgrade should also seek assistance from Bosnia and Herzegovina in obtaining testimony from Bosnian witnesses.  Human Rights Watch recommended a series of additional measures to improve the quality of the Sjeverin trial and other, future war-crime trials. These recommendations include:  The court should endeavor to present the evidence in the trial in a manner that makes it as accessible to the general public as possible, consistent with the rights of the victims, witnesses, and the accused. In that context, the court should install a slide-projector or other mechanism for displaying photographic evidence in the courtroom; The staff of intergovernmental organizations and foreign embassies in Belgrade should monitor the hearings in the Sjeverin trial and other war-crime trials that might follow; The prosecution should seek all witnesses with information relating to the Sjeverin crime. These might include Serbs who witnessed the kidnapping; the only Muslim survivor; the commander of the brigade in the Bosnian Serb army to which the perpetrators belonged; civilians from Visegrad; the Serbian police and investigating judge from the Serbian town of Uzice, near the border with Bosnia, where Milan Lukic was arrested and subsequently released in October 1992 in relation to the incident; and municipal and police officials in Priboj, the Serbian town where the bus arrived after the kidnapping.

These laws have blocked most prosecutions for human rights abuses during military rule in Argentina, when an estimated 15,000 people """"disappeared."""" Among those implicated in on-going human rights investigations is Gen. Ricardo Brinzoni, currently the chief-of-staff of Argentina's army.   Enacted in 1986 and 1987 to appease army unrest provoked by human rights trials,     Argentina's """"full-stop"""" and """"due obedience"""" laws prevent courts from punishing those responsible for gross violations of human rights committed between 1976 and 1983, when Argentina was under military rule. Lower courts have challenged the laws, and the matter is now before the country's nine-member Supreme Court.     The laws were reportedly the sole topic in a meeting held last month between seven Supreme Court justices and army bishop Antonio Juan Baseotto. According to Supreme Court sources reported in the newspaper La Nación, Monsignor Baseotto argued that ratifying the amnesty laws would help national reconciliation. One of the justices, Adolfo Vázquez, reportedly assured the bishop that the court would soon rule the laws constitutional, thus ensuring impunity for human rights crimes.     In his letter to Chief Justice Julio Nazareno, José Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division, said that Vázquez's remarks in advance of the ruling were """"absolutely impermissible.""""     """"The case before the Supreme Court is of the utmost importance, indeed it is crucial to the future of Argentine democracy,"""" Vivanco noted. """"The court must reaffirm the right to justice, a right enshrined in human right treaties to which Argentina is a party and which has the status of constitutional law in Argentina.""""     Lower courts have challenged the amnesty laws repeatedly. In a landmark decision, on March 6, 2001, federal judge Gabriel Cavallo ruled that the amnesty laws were unconstitutional. Another federal judge issued a similar ruling the following October. The Federal Court of Buenos Aires unanimously confirmed both decisions, prompting a final appeal to the Supreme Court by former officers accused of torture and enforced disappearances.     In August 2002, Attorney General Nicolás Becerra recommended that the Supreme Court endorse the Federal Court of Buenos Aires decision.     On March 7, 2003, judge Carlos Skidelsky, who is investigating the December 1976 killing of twenty-two political prisoners in Margarita Belén, Chaco province, became the third federal judge to strike down the amnesty laws. One of those who could face prosecution for this crime is the current chief-of-staff of the Argentine army, Gen. Ricardo Brinzoni, who was secretary general of the Chaco provincial government at the time of the massacre.     The United Nations Human Rights Committee has stated repeatedly that amnesties applied to gross violations of human rights are incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The Inter-American Court of Human Rights, established under the American Convention on Human Rights, gave a similar ruling in 2001. Argentina has ratified both the ICCPR and the American Convention on Human Rights.","Americas, Argentina","International Justice"

This year, it faces a particularly challenging test: whether to hold China and North Korea accountable for their poor human rights records.   Depending on the actions of some key members, the Commission could increase its credibility by acting on the basis of human-rights principles, or allow geopolitical considerations to undermine its mandate. The 53-member body is unwieldy and has no enforcement power. Yet its voice still matters. Whether democracies or dictatorships, or countries """"in transition,"""" governments worldwide seek to avoid the commission's censure.   Even a closed, highly repressive government like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) wants to be seen as part of the U.N. human-rights system -- in form if not in substance. In 1981, North Korea ratified two core treaties, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. More recently, Kim Jong Il's government filed detailed reports with the U.N. committees charged with monitoring compliance.   North Korea may have the worst human-rights record in Asia. But in 2001, Pyongyang told the U.N. that torture is prohibited by law, forced labor """"is never used as a means of political coercion or social and religious punishment,"""" and that North Korean criminal law strictly limits detentions and arrests. It maintained that under the DPRK constitution, basic freedoms of speech, press, assembly, association and religion are fully guaranteed.   Last year, North Korea submitted a second report describing legal protections of the right to work, the freedom of workers to """"form and join a trade union of their choice,"""" and the rights to health and education. The government said it is committed to """"steadily improve the material and cultural life of people."""" While acknowledging the devastating effect of floods and typhoons in the 1990s on grain production, North Korea insisted that it puts a high priority on the right to adequate food for all of its citizens.   Despite the obvious credibility gap, by submitting these reports to the U.N., North Korea has officially affirmed its commitment to internationally recognized rights and standards, and is providing benchmarks that can be used to evaluate its actual performance. But getting access to North Korea to objectively investigate and monitor human rights conditions is a huge problem.   Defectors' stories and accounts by refugees open a narrow window on horrific conditions in North Korean labor camps and prisons, and other systematic abuses. Persuading North Korea to open itself up to visits by U.N. human rights experts, independent monitors and other international observers would be a real breakthrough.   No single diplomatic initiative can solve North Korea's human rights and humanitarian disaster. But it would be a useful first step to get a resolution on North Korea introduced and debated at the Commission critical of abuses and calling for unrestricted access by U.N. human rights experts.   The European Union has agreed in principle to take the lead, pending a signal from Seoul that it will not oppose such a resolution. South Korea has a seat on the commission. The newly elected administration of President Roh Moo Hyun -- a human-rights lawyer by training -- should see this as a constructive, multilateral way to address an extremely difficult issue, and an approach that is completely consistent with his """"sunshine policy.""""   China, for its part, has responded to international criticism of its human-rights record by cooperating with the U.N. -- though reluctantly, and within certain limits. For more than a decade, Beijing has lobbied vigorously to keep any resolutions critical of China off the U.N.'s agenda. Only once, in 1995, was a resolution actually debated, and came within one vote of being adopted. That close call has increased China's determination to prevent any future U.N. action.   At the same time, the threat of censure has pushed Beijing to sign U.N. rights treaties, to release some political prisoners, and to invite U.N. human-rights experts to visit China to conduct investigations or educational seminars.   The UN's expert on torture, Theo van Boven, was recently invited by Beijing, though it's unclear whether he'll be given the cooperation necessary to do a credible investigation. And there's little hope of getting China to implement any of the U.N.'s recommendations for reform unless international pressure is sustained.   With Hu Jintao and a new leadership team coming to power, it is more crucial than ever for the international community to underscore the importance of human rights for China's continued economic and social development. The recent execution of former Tibetan monk Lobsang Dhondup, and the life sentence given to Chinese democracy activist Wang Bingzhang following secret trials, seem to indicate a hardening of official policy. Basic rights of free association and free expression remain under threat. Authorities continue to crack down on independent labor activists, and on users of the Internet who expose corruption or urge political reform.   Last year, no resolution on China was introduced in Geneva: the EU ducked the issue, and the U.S., previously a leading sponsor, didn't put forward a measure citing the fact that it didn't have a seat at the Commission. The EU's foreign ministers meet in Brussels on March 18-19 to make final decisions on the EU's priorities for the commission this year, and will wait until then to see what Washington decides to do about China.   According to the U.S. State Department, President George W. Bush will make the call. With the White House preoccupied with coaxing Beijing to cooperate at the U.N. on Iraq and with the U.S. on nuclear issues in North Korea, the outcome is unpredictable.   The U.S. may drop a China resolution all together, or introduce one only at the last minute in a token effort that China and other commission members can easily ignore. But to allow China to blackmail the U.S. into silence on human rights would be a huge mistake.   Can the U.N. Commission on Human Rights overcome its inherent weaknesses to address some of Asia's serious human-rights problems? Or will it inevitably be driven by geopolitical considerations that make a mockery of its role as the U.N.'s premier human-rights body? How key commission members deal with China and North Korea in the coming weeks will largely determine the outcome.  Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington D.C.

The annual meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights is due to begin on Monday, March 17. Several of the world’s worst rights violators are now among its 53 members, Human Rights Watch said.  “The sustained attention of the world’s major powers can still reverse this dangerous trend,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “But if the United States and the European Union don’t engage themselves systematically in the work of the Commission this year, it could slide into irrelevance.”  With Libya assuming the chairmanship of the Commission, media attention has focused on the abusive governments who have gained seats there in recent years. Indeed, governments who have felt the sting of human rights scrutiny have sought to immunize themselves against criticism by working energetically to limit monitoring by the Commission.  The West, in particular the European Union countries and the United States, have been largely indifferent to this trend, and at times complicit in it, Human Rights Watch said. The European Union still sponsors most country resolutions and takes the lead on many other initiatives at the Commission. But its effectiveness has been diminished in recent years by its internal consensus rule, under which resolution drafts and statements have settled at the most watered-down version presented by one of the fifteen.  Human Rights Watch called on the Commission to pass resolutions on several countries, including: China, Colombia, Iran, North Korea, the Russian Federation (Chechnya), and Turkmenistan.  Human Rights Watch has also urged the appointment of a Special Representative to monitor counter terrorist measures worldwide and their impact on human rights, as well as the appointment of a special envoy to secure the release of children abducted in northern Uganda.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Global","United Nations"

Djindjic was a leading force behind the progress Serbia has made in respect for human rights and the rule of law since the October 2000 fall of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Human Rights Watch said. Zoran Djindjic, age 50, was fatally shot twice in front of the main government building in central Belgrade mid-day Wednesday. Unconfirmed press reports indicated that the police arrested two suspects. Djindjic had been prime minister since January 2001, after a coalition of democratic parties won the December 2000 parliamentary elections in Serbia.  “Zoran Djindjic recognized that pursuing reform and respecting Serbia’s international obligations will pave the way to a prosperous future for the country, thoroughly integrated into Europe,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. Djindjic is credited with the arrest and transfer or surrender of a number of indicted war criminals, including former President Slobodan Milosevic, to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  While the identity and motives of Djindjic’s assassins are currently unknown, Human Rights Watch said that the perpetrators may be connected to those responsible for war crimes, political crimes, and other grave violations of human rights committed in the former Yugoslavia over the past decade. Despite some progress toward accountability at the ICTY and in Serbia’s own courts, many of those individuals remained at large and involved in organized crime after the change of government in late 2000. Human Rights Watch called on the government to step up its efforts to bring to justice the human rights violators from the Milosevic era.  “The rule of law will remain fragile in Serbia until the work Djindjic began is completed,” Andersen said.  Acting on a proposal from the government of Serbia, Acting Serbian President Natasa Micic declared a state of emergency Wednesday evening. The government’s proposal included a provision authorizing the army of the union of Serbia and Montenegro to assume responsibilities normally belonging to the Serbian police.

The Sierra Leone Special Court Prosecutor, David Crane, yesterday announced indictments against Foday Saybana Sankoh, Johnny Paul Koroma, Sam Bockarie, Issa Hassan Sesay, Alex Tamba Brima, Morris Kallon and Sam Hinga Norman, for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and violations of international humanitarian law. Sankoh, Sesay, Brima, Kallon, and Norman are in custody. """"This is a key step towards accountability for the horrific crimes of the civil war in Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"We applaud the court for having the courage to indict persons who were on all sides of the conflict.""""  The crimes alleged in the indictments include murder, rape, extermination, acts of terror, enslavement, looting and burning, sexual slavery, conscription of children into an armed force, and attacks on UNAMSIL peacekeepers and humanitarian assistance workers.  The civil war in Sierra Leone was marked by serious atrocities committed principally by the members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)/Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) rebel alliance. Civilians bore the brunt of these abuses in widespread and systematic attacks characterized by murder, mutilation, amputation, torture, rape and forced abductions. Civilian Defense Forces (CDF) militias fighting on behalf of the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah also committed numerous human rights violations, albeit on a smaller scale and of a different nature than those committed by the rebel alliance.  Foday Sankoh was leader of the RUF. Johnny Paul Koroma was head of the AFRC. Sam Bockarie was a particularly notorious RUF commander, and Sam Hinga Norman led the Kamajors, the largest and most powerful group of the CDF. Norman is currently Sierra Leone Minister of Internal Affairs.  The Special Court is a """"mixed"""" tribunal that has both international and domestic elements, including international and Sierra Leonean judges and staff. The court is designed to function for three years and has power to prosecute those """"who bear the greatest responsibility"""" for serious violations of international humanitarian law and certain violations of Sierra Leone law committed in Sierra Leone since November 30, 1996.  While Human Rights Watch welcomed the indictments, Takirambudde said that """"they are only one step on the long road to a full accounting of crimes committed in Sierra Leone.""""  Because the Special Court is anticipated to prosecute around twenty persons, it will leave many crimes unaddressed. A Truth and Reconciliation Commission is also at work in Sierra Leone. Its mandate is to seek to establish an impartial historical record of the conflict and promote reconciliation, but it will not have the capacity to adjudicate criminal responsibility.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice"

He described the use of electric shock, burning with hot irons, acid, and rape.  He said that the Iraqi government tortured children to get their parents to confess to crimes.  President Bush concluded:  """"If this isn't evil, then evil has no meaning.""""There is now strong evidence that the United States itself has engaged in   torture and condoned its use by others as part of its war against terrorism.   Photographs of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, hooded, naked,   attached to wires, attacked by dogs, forced to simulate sex acts and assume   humiliating and painful postitions, and presided over by smiling U.S. military   personnel have shocked the world. Other incidents of abuse and even murder   have come to light and received new attention.    Although President Bush apologized for the Abu Ghraib incident and military   investigations are proceeding against the individuals involved in these incidents   and others, there as yet has been no commitment by the United States to prosecute   those found responsible for torture or inhuman and degrading treatment for   war crimes.    The number of such incidents reported in the media   since 2002, confidential and internal reports of abuse to superior officers   with responsibility for prison policies, and statements that guards were instructed   to “soften up” prisoners for interrogation, all suggest that these   incidents are indicative of a policy condoning or tolerant of torture, official   denials notwithstanding.    Long before the Abu Ghraib scandal, newspapers such as the New York Times and   the Washington Post published credible reports, based on interviews   with former detainees and unnamed U.S. officials, alleging that U.S. agents   abused   terrorist suspects or handed them over to foreign governments with documented   records of torture. None of the reported allegations suggest the United States   has utilized such horrific techniques as electric shock or burning. They do,   however, suggest that the United States has been willing to inflict other forms   of physical or mental pain in an effort to obtain intelligence from captured   terrorist suspects.According to a December 26, 2002 story in the Washington Post, """"U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations"""" captured al-Qaeda operatives and Taliban commanders held at the U.S.-occupied Bagram air base in Afghanistan are subjected to physical and psychological """"stress and duress"""" techniques, including being held blindfolded or hooded, bound in awkward painful positions, and deprived of sleep for prolonged periods.  Prior to interrogation, some captives have been beaten.  One unnamed U.S. official quoted in the Washington Post stated, """"If you don't violate someone's human rights some of the time, you probably aren't doing your job."""" U.S. papers have also reported that the United States handed over some suspects to countries with documented histories of torture.  One U.S. official directly involved in the rendition of suspects to third countries told Washington Post reporters that he knew they were likely to be tortured.  The story suggested that CIA officials are willing to use the fruits of intelligence foreign countries obtained using torture.  On March 4, 2003, the Wall     Street Journal, in an article entitled """"How do U.S. Interrogators make a Captured Terrorist Talk?,"""" quoted a senior federal law-enforcer as saying that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al-Qaeda's alleged leader of terrorist operations against the United States, would be interrogated """"in some other country that'll let us pistol whip this guy."""" Men who had been held under American custody at Bagram have described standing   naked, their faces hooded, their arms raised, and chained to the ceiling, their   feet shackled for days on end (thirteen days in the case of one of them) without   being allowed to sleep. The U.S. military has begun a criminal investigation   into the deaths two Afghan men held at Bagram, both of whom died as a result   of blunt force injuries. An U.S. Army pathologist reportedly classified the   deaths as homicides. (See, New     York Times, """"Threats and Responses: Prisonsers; U.S. Military Investigating     Death of Afghan in Custody,"""" March 4, 2003, and Washington     Post, """"Army Probing Deaths of 2 Afghan Prisoners,"""" March 5, 2003.) On March 6, 2003, President Bush told visiting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio Vieira de Mello that the United States is not using torture on al-Qaeda detainees.  To date, however, no senior administration official has refuted the specific allegations of abusive interrogations presented in the media.  No senior administration official has unequivocally stated that it is against U.S. policy to engage in the techniques described in media accounts or to send detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured.  No official has said that U.S. agents who use torture, who are complicit in its use, or who send suspects to countries where they are tortured, will be held accountable.  The recent capture of high-ranking al-Qaeda suspects has rekindled a debate   in the United States about whether torture is or should be used during their   interrogation. Many Americans—including, apparently, U.S. officials—are unaware   of the absolute, unequivocal prohibition against torture or other cruel, inhuman   or degrading treatment of any person, including terrorist suspects. The right   to be free from such mistreatment is one of the most fundamental and unequivocal   human rights. As the United States confronts terrorism, legitimate national   security needs, public anxiety, and the desire for retribution may give rise   to the temptation to sacrifice certain fundamental rights. But that temptation   must be vigorously resisted. The right not to be tortured or mistreated is   not a luxury to be dispensed with in difficult times, but the very essence   of a society worth defending.  President Bush has said that the war on terrorism is about values; he has pledged that as it fights, the United States will always stand for """"the non-negotiable demands of human dignity.""""  Standing for human dignity means rejecting torture and other forms of ill treatment. Rejecting torture does not mean forgoing effective interrogations of terrorist suspects.  Patient, skillful, professional interrogations obtain critical information without relying on cruelty or inhuman or degrading treatment.  Indeed, most seasoned interrogators recognize that torture is not only immoral and illegal, but ineffective and unnecessary as well.  Given that people being tortured will say anything to stop the pain, the information yielded from torture is often false or of dubious reliability. The prohibition against torture is firmly embedded in customary international law, international treaties signed by the United States, and in U.S. law. As the U.S. Department of State has noted, the """"United States has long been a vigorous supporter of the international fight against torture…Every unit of government at every level within the United States is committed, by law as well as by policy, to the protection of the individual's life, liberty and physical integrity"""" [U.S. Department of State, """"Initial Report of the United States of America to the UN Committee Against Torture."""" Oct 15, 1999. (15 Nov. 2001)]. That commitment should not be abandoned. Indeed, it must be deepened as the world watches how the U.S. responds to the challenges before it. If the U.S. were to condone torture by government officials or foreign governments in its fight against terrorism, it would betray its own principles, laws, and international treaty obligations. It would irreparably weaken its standing to oppose torture elsewhere in the world. And it would provide a handy excuse to other governments to use torture to pursue their own national security objectives. In this paper, Human Rights Watch provides an overview of the international and national prohibitions against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, with a focus on the prohibition as it applies to the interrogation of detainees.  What is torture? What laws prohibit torture? Do non-citizens in the U.S. have the same right not to be tortured as U.S. citizens? Can a person be compelled to provide evidence? Can limited physical force be used during interrogations? Is the use of """"truth serums"""" permitted? Are there any situations in which torture is permitted? Shouldn't torture be permitted if its use will save lives? Does the U.S. lose valuable information if torture is prohibited? May the U.S. send detainees to other countries to be questioned? What are the remedies against torture?  Q: What is torture? The Convention against Torture defines torture as """"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession…."""" (Art. 1). It may be """"inflicted by or at the instigation of or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity."""" The prohibition against torture under international law applies to many measures—e.g.   beating on the soles of the feet; electric shock applied to genitals and nipples;   rape; near drowning through submersion in water; near suffocation by plastic   bags tied around the head; burning; whipping; needles inserted under fingernails;   mutilation; hanging by feet or hands for prolonged periods. International law also prohibits mistreatment that does not meet the definition   of torture, either because less severe physical or mental pain is inflicted,   or because the necessary purpose of the ill-treatment is not present. It affirms   the right of every person not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading   treatment. Examples of such prohibited mistreatment include being forced to   stand spread eagled against the wall; being subjected to bright lights or   blindfolding; being subjected to continuous loud noise; being deprived of sleep,   food or drink; being subjected to forced constant standing or crouching; or   violent shaking. In essence, any form of physical treatment used to intimidate,   coerce or """"break"""" a person during an interrogation constitutes prohibited ill-treatment.   If these practices are intense enough, prolonged in duration, or combined with   other measures that result in severe pain or suffering, they can qualify as   torture. The prohibition against torture as well as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment   is not limited to acts causing physical pain or injury. It includes acts that   cause mental suffering—e.g. through threats against family or loved ones. As   the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, """"coercion can be mental as well as physical…the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition"""" Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 448, (1966) citing Blackburn v. State of Alabama, 361 U.S. 199 (1960).  As discussed below, the use of mind-altering drugs to compel a person to provide information would at least amount to inhuman or degrading treatment under the Convention against Torture.  Q: What laws prohibit torture? Torture is universally condemned, and whatever its actual practice, no country publicly supports torture or opposes its eradication.  The prohibition against torture is well established under customary international law as jus cogens; that is, it has the highest standing in customary law and is so fundamental as to supercede all other treaties and customary laws (except laws that are also jus cogens).  Criminal acts that are jus cogens are subject to universal jurisdiction, meaning that any state can exercise its jurisdiction, regardless of where the crime took place, the nationality of the perpetrator or the nationality of the victim. In 1948, following the horrific abuses of World War II, the General Assembly of the United Nations inserted the prohibition against torture in the landmark Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  Article 5 states: """"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""""  This ban on torture and other ill-treatment has subsequently been incorporated into the extensive network of international and regional human rights treaties.  It is contained in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by 153 countries, including the United States in 1992, and in the Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment  (the Convention against Torture), ratified by 136 countries, including the United States in 1994.  It is also codified in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and the American Convention on Human Rights. The prohibition against torture is also fundamental to humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war), which governs the conduct of parties during armed conflict.  An important element of international humanitarian law is the duty to protect the life, health and safety of civilians and other noncombatants, including soldiers who are captured or who have laid down their arms.  Torture of such protected persons is absolutely forbidden.  Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, for example, bans """"violence of life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"""" as well as  """"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.""""  The use of force to obtain information is specifically prohibited in Article 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention: """"No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected persons, in particular to obtain information from them or from third parties."""" According to the 1999 Initial Report of the United States to the U.N. Committee against Torture, in the United States, the use of torture """"is categorically denounced as a matter of policy and as a tool of state authority…No official of the government, federal, state or local, civilian or military, is authorized to commit or to instruct anyone else to commit torture.  Nor may any official condone or tolerate torture in any form…Every act of torture within the meaning of the [Convention against Torture] is illegal under existing federal and state law, and any individual who commits such an act is subject to penal sanctions as specified in criminal statutes."""" Although no single provision of the U.S. Constitution expressly prohibits torture as a means to extract information, secure a confession, punish for an act committed, intimidate or coerce, or for any reason based on discrimination, there is no question that torture violates rights established by the Bill of Rights.  The U.S. courts have located constitutional protections against interrogations under torture in the Fourth Amendment's right to be free of unreasonable search or seizure (which encompasses the right not be abused by the police), the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination (which encompasses the right to remain silent during interrogations), the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments' guarantees of due process (ensuring fundamental fairness in criminal justice system), and the Eighth Amendment's right to be free of cruel or unusual punishment.  In numerous cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has condemned the use of force amounting to torture or other forms of ill treatment during interrogations, including such practices as whipping, slapping, depriving a victim of food, water, or sleep, keeping him naked or in a small cell for prolonged periods, holding a gun to his head, or threatening him with mob violence.  Torture would also violate state constitutions, whose provisions generally parallel the protections set forth in the federal Bill of Rights. Article 4 of the Convention against Torture obligates state parties to ensure that all acts of torture are criminal offenses under domestic legislation.  Although there is no single federal law specifically criminalizing torture, the United States has insisted that existing federal and state laws render illegal any act falling with the Convention against Torture's definition of torture.  In the United States, most criminal laws are state rather than federal.  Although a few states have laws addressing torture as such, each state has laws that criminalize violence against persons (e.g. assault, rape), regardless of whether committed by public officials or private individuals.  In addition, states typically have specific laws that criminalize acts by public officials that constitute abuses of authority, """"official oppression,"""" or the unlawful infliction of bodily injury.  The principal federal law that would apply to torture against detainees is 18 U.S.C. 242, which makes it a criminal offense for any public official to willfully to deprive a person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  Q: Do non-citizens in the U.S. have the same right not to be tortured as U.S. citizens? Yes.  Neither international nor domestic law conditions the right not to be   subjected to torture on citizenship or nationality. No detainee held by U.S.   authorities—regardless of nationality, regardless of whether held in the U.S.   or in another country, and regardless of whether the person is deemed a combatant   or civilian—may be tortured. All applicable international law applies to   U.S. officials operating abroad, including the Convention against Torture and   the Geneva Conventions. The prohibition against torture is universal and covers   all countries both regarding U.S. citizens and persons of other nationalities. Q: Can a person be compelled to provide evidence? Using force or the infliction of pain to overcome an individual's desire to maintain silent during interrogations not only violates the victim's right to be free from torture but also his or her right not to speak during an interrogation.  The right against being compelled to testify against oneself is contained in Article 14 of the ICCPR.  The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution also affirms the right against self-incrimination.  This right has been interpreted to include the right to remain silent during custodial interrogations, regardless of whether the information sought would be incriminating.  There are only extremely limited exceptions to the right to remain silent.  For example, the threat of imprisonment can be used to lawfully compel a witness to speak in grand jury proceedings provided the witness has been granted some form of immunity, i.e. protection against having the testimony used against him in subsequent criminal proceedings. But these exceptions to the right against self-incrimination do not in any sense permit violations of the separate right to be free of torture.  Torture is never permitted to overcome a witness's desire to remain silent. Recognizing the potential for abuse during interrogations, U.S. courts have   constructed special rules to diminish the likelihood of coerced testimony.   They have, for example, ruled that coerced statements are not admissible at   trial—whether they are deemed compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment's   privilege against self-incrimination or """"involuntary"""" in violation of the right to due process.  The U.S. Supreme Court in 1966 also established a rule requiring the police who seek to question detainees to inform them of their """"Miranda"""" rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during the questioning [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)].  In explaining the need for this rule, the Court noted the continuing police practice of using physical force to extract confessions, citing, as an example, a case in which police beat, kicked and burned with lighted cigarette butts a potential witness under interrogation. The Convention against Torture provides that any statement that has been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. Q: Can limited physical force be used during interrogations?Force can never be used to pressure a detainee to speak, even if it seems only slight or moderate. The absolute injunction against force has practical as well as moral underpinnings.  Historical practice shows there is no such thing as a """"little bit"""" of physical pressure to compel someone to speak during an interrogation.  Once a degree of force is permitted, interrogators face an overwhelming temptation to continue applying as much force as is necessary to acquire the sought-for information. Q: Is the use of """"truth serums"""" permitted? While the forcible administration of so-called """"truth serums""""—drugs   such as sodium pentothal, sodium amytal, and scopolamine —does not involve   the infliction of severe pain, its use to secure information from a person   would nonetheless be prohibited under international law. Human Rights Watch   believes that at a minimum it would violate the person's right to be free from """"inhuman or degrading"""" treatment.  We note that Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture expressly defines torture as including """"the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish."""" The prohibition against the ill-treatment of persons under interrogation is   rooted in respect for human dignity and the inviolability of the human body   and mind. To force a person to talk through the application of drugs is as   much a denial of human dignity as to coerce talk through the use of physical   force. Securing testimony through the involuntary administration of drugs would   also violate the right against self-incrimination if it were not done under   a grant of use immunity. But even if such immunity were given—thus solving   the problem of self-incrimination—drugging would still be prohibited because   of its inhuman and degrading nature. Because of its profound compromise of   the human personality, the use of drugs is quite different from the forcible   taking of physical evidence—hair, blood, DNA, etc.—which is permitted under   U.S. and international law. The administration of any of the drugs identified as having the potential for causing a person to talk is an involved medical procedure requiring delivery of the drug intravenously over a period that can range from two to twelve hours.  The international Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the Role of Health Personnel provide that the participation of doctors or other medical practitioners in the administration of such drugs for interrogation purposes would violate medical ethics. The use of truth serums is not an authorized method of interrogation in the United States. Under U.S. law, confessions made under the influence of truth serums are not """"voluntary"""" and are consequently inadmissible as evidence Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963). Investigators are not severely handicapped by not being able to use """"truth serums.""""  While certain drugs may reduce a person's inhibitions against talking, they do not guarantee that the person will in fact tell the truth.  Under the influence of such drugs, people may become highly suggestible, picking up cues from the interrogators and agreeing to information that is not true; they may relate fantasies; and they may still be able to deliberately mislead.  According to a study by medical and legal experts:    """"experimental and clinical findings indicate that only individuals who have conscious and unconscious reasons for doing so are inclined to confess and yield to interrogation under drug influence.  On the other hand, some are able to withhold information and some, especially character neurotics, are able to lie.  Others are so suggestible they will describe, in response to suggestive questioning, behavior which never in fact occurred....But drugs are not 'truth sera.'  They lessen inhibitions to verbalization and stimulate unrepressed expression not only of fact but of fancy and suggestions as well.  Thus the material produced is not 'truth' in the sense that it conforms to empirical fact"""" [Dession, Freedman, Donnelly, and Redlich, """"Drug Induced Revelation and Criminal Investigation,"""" 62 Yale L.J. 315, 319 (1953)].       As another expert noted, """"the intravenous injection of a drug by a physician in a hospital may appear more scientific than the drinking of large amounts of bourbon in a tavern, but the end result displayed in the subject's speech may be no more reliable."""" MacDonald, """"Truth Serums,"""" 46 Crim. L.C.& P.S. 259 (1955). U.S. courts have generally ruled the use of truth serums is not a """"trustworthy truth-extracting procedure"""" and have held evidence thus acquired is inadmissible, regardless of whether the drugs were administered voluntarily or involuntarily. E.g., Lindsey v. U.S., 237 F.2d 893, 897 (9th Cir.1956). Q: Are there any situations in which torture is permitted? Under customary international law as well as underinternational human rights treaties, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is prohibited at all times and in all circumstances.  It is a non-derogable right, one of those core rights that may never be suspended, even during times of war, when national security is threatened, or during other public emergencies. According to the U.S. government, """"U.S. law contains no provision     permitting otherwise prohibited acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman     or degrading treatment or punishment to be employed on grounds of exigent     circumstances (for example, during a """"state of public emergency"""") or on orders     from a superior officer or public authority."""" The European Court of Human Rights has applied the prohibition against torture contained in European Convention on Human Rights in several cases involving alleged terrorists.  As it noted in one case, """"The Court is well aware of the immense difficulties faced by States in modern times in protecting their communities from terrorist violence.  However, even in these circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct."""" (Chahal v. United Kingdom, Nov. 15, 1996) Similarly, the Committee against Torture, reviewing Israel's use of torture as a method of interrogation against suspected Palestinian terrorists, stated, """"The Committee acknowledges the terrible dilemma that Israel confronts in dealing with terrorist threats to its security, but as a State party to the Convention Israel is precluded from raising before this Committee exceptional circumstances as justification for [prohibited] acts"""" [United Nations Committee against Torture. """"Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture"""" (1997), A/52/44,paras.253-260. (15 Nov. 2001).] Q: Shouldn't torture be permitted if its use will save lives? Some people argue that the goal of saving innocent lives must override a person's right not to be tortured.   This argument is presented in its starkest form in the """"ticking bomb"""" scenario: a bomb has been set to explode that will kill thousands of people and a detained person is known to have information on where the bomb is and how to defuse it.  Is torture justified in such a case to force the detainee to talk?  Those who say that it is argue that governments should be permitted to choose torture as the lesser of two evils in such a situation. The international community, however, rejected the use of torture even in the """"ticking bomb"""" case.  International human rights law - as well as U.S. law - do not contain any exceptions to the prohibition against torture. There are practical as well as moral reasons for not permitting a """"ticking bomb"""" -or terrorist attack -- exception to the ban on torture.  Although such an exception might appear to be highly limited, experience shows that the exception readily becomes the standard practice.  For example, how imminent must the attack be to trigger the exception and justify torture - an hour, a week, a year?  How certain must the government be that the detainee actually has the necessary information?  Under the utilitarian logic that the end (saving many innocent lives) justifies the means, torture should be permitted even if the disaster might not occur until some point in the future, and it should be permitted against as many people as is necessary to secure the information that could be used to avert the disaster. Israel provides a good example of how this logic works in practice.  For years Israel justified its use of torture - what it called """"moderate physical force"""" - by citing the """"ticking bomb"""" scenario.  But despite a genuine security threat, Israeli security forces rarely if ever were able to identify a particular suspect with knowledge about a particular bomb set to explode imminently.  Rather, they ended up applying the scenario metaphorically to justify torturing virtually every Palestinian security detainee - thousands of people - on the theory that they might know something about some unspecified, future terrorist act.  In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the use of torture, although the practice seems to have increased in the past year. In addition, the ticking bomb scenario offers no logical limitations on how much or what kind of torture would be permitted.  If the detainee does not talk when shaken or hit, why shouldn't the government move unto more severe measures, such as the application of electric shocks?  Why not threaten to rape the suspect's wife or to torture his children?  Once torture is allowed, setting limits is extraordinarily difficult. Q: Does the U.S. lose valuable information if torture is prohibited? Torture is as likely to yield false information as it is to yield the truth. Cesare Beccaria, the eighteenth century philosopher whose critique of torture remains influential today, observed that when a person is tortured, the """"impression of pain…may increase to such a degree, that, occupying the mind entirely, it will compel the sufferer to use the shortest method of freeing himself from torment…[H]e will accuse himself of crimes of which he is innocent."""" Beccaria also pointed out the problem of using torture to discover the accused's accomplices: """"Will not the man who [under torture falsely] accuses himself yet more readily accuse others?"""" [Beccaria, Cesare, Of Crimes and Punishments.  (15 Nov. 2001).] .  Contemporary law enforcement professionals concur. Oliver Ravel, former deputy director of the FBI, has stated that force is not effective: """"people will even admit they killed their grandmother, just to stop the beatings.""""  Indeed, the unreliability of forced confessions was one of the principal reasons that U.S. courts originally prohibited their use. The prohibition on torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading conduct does not leave the government helpless before terrorists.  Convictions in recent cases involving terrorism show that investigators currently have the means and legal methods to acquire the evidence necessary for successful prosecutions. Q: May the U.S. send detainees to other countries to be questioned? The United States may not send detainees to another country to be questioned by police or security forces who use torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during their interrogation.  Article 3 of the Convention against Torture expressly prohibits sending a person to another state """"where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.""""  Human Rights Watch believes that the U.S. government would be complicit in torture - in essence, aiding and abetting torture - if it sent detainees to another country aware that they might be tortured there.  The purpose of U.S. human rights commitments would be circumvented if the U.S. government could effectively subcontract interrogation techniques that it is prohibited from using itself. Q: What are the remedies against torture? Under U.S. law, victims of torture can sue in state or federal court for damages. But there are numerous practical obstacles to such lawsuits - including the difficulty of securing evidence of torture and the financial costs of legal representation - as well as legal and procedural impediments to a successful conclusion.  Moreover, even if a case is successful and damages are awarded, the financial compensation does not undo the harm done - the experience of torture and its often ongoing physical, psychological, and emotional consequences.  Officials who engage in torture - including those who give the orders as well as those who carry them out - can and should be prosecuted criminally as well as disciplinarily sanctioned.  Nevertheless, history counsels that the decision to prosecute public officials, the actual charges brought, and the penalties sought are often influenced by such extra-legal considerations as public sympathy for the victim or support for the officials and the political context in which the crime took place. The best """"remedy"""" for torture is thus prevention.  U.S. officials should resolutely resist any temptation or encouragement to use torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment against detainees held and questioned in connection with its campaign against terrorism.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/03/11/legal-prohibition-against-torture-0","The Legal Prohibition Against Torture","The Legal Prohibition Against Torture","","03/11/2003","During his State of the Union address, President Bush spoke about the horrifying torture techniques Saddam Hussein has inflicted on prisoners in Iraq. He described the use of electric shock, burning with hot irons, acid, and rape. He said that the Iraqi government tortured children to get their parents to confess to crimes. President Bush concluded: """"If this isn't evil, then evil has no meaning."""" There is now strong evidence that the United States itself has engaged in torture and condoned its use by others as part of its war against terrorism. Photographs of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, hooded, naked, attached to wires, attacked by dogs, forced to simulate sex acts and assume humiliating and painful postitions, and presided over by smiling U.S. military personnel have shocked the world. Other incidents of abuse and even murder have come to light and received new attention.  Although President Bush apologized for the Abu Ghraib incident and military investigations are proceeding against the individuals involved in these incidents and others, there as yet has been no commitment by the United States to prosecute those found responsible for torture or inhuman and degrading treatment for war crimes. The number of such incidents reported in the media since 2002, confidential and internal reports of abuse to superior officers with responsibility for prison policies, and statements that guards were instructed to “soften up” prisoners for interrogation, all suggest that these incidents are indicative of a policy condoning or tolerant of torture, official denials notwithstanding.  Long before the Abu Ghraib scandal, newspapers such as the New York Times and the Washington Post published credible reports, based on interviews with former detainees and unnamed U.S. officials, alleging that U.S. agents abused terrorist suspects or handed them over to foreign governments with documented records of torture. None of the reported allegations suggest the United States has utilized such horrific techniques as electric shock or burning. They do, however, suggest that the United States has been willing to inflict other forms of physical or mental pain in an effort to obtain intelligence from captured terrorist suspects. According to a December 26, 2002 story in the Washington Post, """"U.S. Decries Abuse but Defends Interrogations"""" captured al-Qaeda operatives and Taliban commanders held at the U.S.-occupied Bagram air base in Afghanistan are subjected to physical and psychological """"stress and duress"""" techniques, including being held blindfolded or hooded, bound in awkward painful positions, and deprived of sleep for prolonged periods. Prior to interrogation, some captives have been beaten. One unnamed U.S. official quoted in the Washington Post stated, """"If you don't violate someone's human rights some of the time, you probably aren't doing your job."""" U.S. papers have also reported that the United States handed over some suspects to countries with documented histories of torture. One U.S. official directly involved in the rendition of suspects to third countries told Washington Post reporters that he knew they were likely to be tortured. The story suggested that CIA officials are willing to use the fruits of intelligence foreign countries obtained using torture. On March 4, 2003, the Wall Street Journal, in an article entitled """"How do U.S. Interrogators make a Captured Terrorist Talk?,"""" quoted a senior federal law-enforcer as saying that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, al-Qaeda's alleged leader of terrorist operations against the United States, would be interrogated """"in some other country that'll let us pistol whip this guy."""" Men who had been held under American custody at Bagram have described standing naked, their faces hooded, their arms raised, and chained to the ceiling, their feet shackled for days on end (thirteen days in the case of one of them) without being allowed to sleep. The U.S. military has begun a criminal investigation into the deaths two Afghan men held at Bagram, both of whom died as a result of blunt force injuries. An U.S. Army pathologist reportedly classified the deaths as homicides. (See, New York Times, """"Threats and Responses: Prisonsers; U.S. Military Investigating Death of Afghan in Custody,"""" March 4, 2003, and Washington Post, """"Army Probing Deaths of 2 Afghan Prisoners,"""" March 5, 2003.) On March 6, 2003, President Bush told visiting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio Vieira de Mello that the United States is not using torture on al-Qaeda detainees. To date, however, no senior administration official has refuted the specific allegations of abusive interrogations presented in the media. No senior administration official has unequivocally stated that it is against U.S. policy to engage in the techniques described in media accounts or to send detainees to countries where they are likely to be tortured. No official has said that U.S. agents who use torture, who are complicit in its use, or who send suspects to countries where they are tortured, will be held accountable. The recent capture of high-ranking al-Qaeda suspects has rekindled a debate in the United States about whether torture is or should be used during their interrogation. Many Americans—including, apparently, U.S. officials—are unaware of the absolute, unequivocal prohibition against torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of any person, including terrorist suspects. The right to be free from such mistreatment is one of the most fundamental and unequivocal human rights. As the United States confronts terrorism, legitimate national security needs, public anxiety, and the desire for retribution may give rise to the temptation to sacrifice certain fundamental rights. But that temptation must be vigorously resisted. The right not to be tortured or mistreated is not a luxury to be dispensed with in difficult times, but the very essence of a society worth defending. President Bush has said that the war on terrorism is about values; he has pledged that as it fights, the United States will always stand for """"the non-negotiable demands of human dignity."""" Standing for human dignity means rejecting torture and other forms of ill treatment. Rejecting torture does not mean forgoing effective interrogations of terrorist suspects. Patient, skillful, professional interrogations obtain critical information without relying on cruelty or inhuman or degrading treatment. Indeed, most seasoned interrogators recognize that torture is not only immoral and illegal, but ineffective and unnecessary as well. Given that people being tortured will say anything to stop the pain, the information yielded from torture is often false or of dubious reliability. The prohibition against torture is firmly embedded in customary international law, international treaties signed by the United States, and in U.S. law. As the U.S. Department of State has noted, the """"United States has long been a vigorous supporter of the international fight against torture…Every unit of government at every level within the United States is committed, by law as well as by policy, to the protection of the individual's life, liberty and physical integrity"""" [U.S. Department of State, """"Initial Report of the United States of America to the UN Committee Against Torture."""" Oct 15, 1999. (15 Nov. 2001)]. That commitment should not be abandoned. Indeed, it must be deepened as the world watches how the U.S. responds to the challenges before it. If the U.S. were to condone torture by government officials or foreign governments in its fight against terrorism, it would betray its own principles, laws, and international treaty obligations. It would irreparably weaken its standing to oppose torture elsewhere in the world. And it would provide a handy excuse to other governments to use torture to pursue their own national security objectives. In this paper, Human Rights Watch provides an overview of the international and national prohibitions against torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, with a focus on the prohibition as it applies to the interrogation of detainees. What is torture? What laws prohibit torture? Do non-citizens in the U.S. have the same right not to be tortured as U.S. citizens? Can a person be compelled to provide evidence? Can limited physical force be used during interrogations? Is the use of """"truth serums"""" permitted? Are there any situations in which torture is permitted? Shouldn't torture be permitted if its use will save lives? Does the U.S. lose valuable information if torture is prohibited? May the U.S. send detainees to other countries to be questioned? What are the remedies against torture?  What is torture? What laws prohibit torture? Do non-citizens in the U.S. have the same right not to be tortured as U.S. citizens? Can a person be compelled to provide evidence? Can limited physical force be used during interrogations? Is the use of """"truth serums"""" permitted? Are there any situations in which torture is permitted? Shouldn't torture be permitted if its use will save lives? Does the U.S. lose valuable information if torture is prohibited? May the U.S. send detainees to other countries to be questioned? What are the remedies against torture?  Q: What is torture? The Convention against Torture defines torture as """"any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession…."""" (Art. 1). It may be """"inflicted by or at the instigation of or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity."""" The prohibition against torture under international law applies to many measures—e.g. beating on the soles of the feet; electric shock applied to genitals and nipples; rape; near drowning through submersion in water; near suffocation by plastic bags tied around the head; burning; whipping; needles inserted under fingernails; mutilation; hanging by feet or hands for prolonged periods. International law also prohibits mistreatment that does not meet the definition of torture, either because less severe physical or mental pain is inflicted, or because the necessary purpose of the ill-treatment is not present. It affirms the right of every person not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Examples of such prohibited mistreatment include being forced to stand spread eagled against the wall; being subjected to bright lights or blindfolding; being subjected to continuous loud noise; being deprived of sleep, food or drink; being subjected to forced constant standing or crouching; or violent shaking. In essence, any form of physical treatment used to intimidate, coerce or """"break"""" a person during an interrogation constitutes prohibited ill-treatment. If these practices are intense enough, prolonged in duration, or combined with other measures that result in severe pain or suffering, they can qualify as torture. The prohibition against torture as well as cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is not limited to acts causing physical pain or injury. It includes acts that cause mental suffering—e.g. through threats against family or loved ones. As the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, """"coercion can be mental as well as physical…the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition"""" Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 448, (1966) citing Blackburn v. State of Alabama, 361 U.S. 199 (1960). As discussed below, the use of mind-altering drugs to compel a person to provide information would at least amount to inhuman or degrading treatment under the Convention against Torture. Q: What laws prohibit torture? Torture is universally condemned, and whatever its actual practice, no country publicly supports torture or opposes its eradication. The prohibition against torture is well established under customary international law as jus cogens; that is, it has the highest standing in customary law and is so fundamental as to supercede all other treaties and customary laws (except laws that are also jus cogens). Criminal acts that are jus cogens are subject to universal jurisdiction, meaning that any state can exercise its jurisdiction, regardless of where the crime took place, the nationality of the perpetrator or the nationality of the victim. In 1948, following the horrific abuses of World War II, the General Assembly of the United Nations inserted the prohibition against torture in the landmark Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 5 states: """"No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."""" This ban on torture and other ill-treatment has subsequently been incorporated into the extensive network of international and regional human rights treaties. It is contained in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by 153 countries, including the United States in 1992, and in the Convention against Torture or Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Convention against Torture), ratified by 136 countries, including the United States in 1994. It is also codified in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, and the American Convention on Human Rights. The prohibition against torture is also fundamental to humanitarian law (also known as the laws of war), which governs the conduct of parties during armed conflict. An important element of international humanitarian law is the duty to protect the life, health and safety of civilians and other noncombatants, including soldiers who are captured or who have laid down their arms. Torture of such protected persons is absolutely forbidden. Common Article 3 to the Geneva Conventions, for example, bans """"violence of life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"""" as well as """"outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment."""" The use of force to obtain information is specifically prohibited in Article 31 of the Fourth Geneva Convention: """"No physical or moral coercion shall be exercised against protected persons, in particular to obtain information from them or from third parties."""" According to the 1999 Initial Report of the United States to the U.N. Committee against Torture, in the United States, the use of torture """"is categorically denounced as a matter of policy and as a tool of state authority…No official of the government, federal, state or local, civilian or military, is authorized to commit or to instruct anyone else to commit torture. Nor may any official condone or tolerate torture in any form…Every act of torture within the meaning of the [Convention against Torture] is illegal under existing federal and state law, and any individual who commits such an act is subject to penal sanctions as specified in criminal statutes."""" Although no single provision of the U.S. Constitution expressly prohibits torture as a means to extract information, secure a confession, punish for an act committed, intimidate or coerce, or for any reason based on discrimination, there is no question that torture violates rights established by the Bill of Rights. The U.S. courts have located constitutional protections against interrogations under torture in the Fourth Amendment's right to be free of unreasonable search or seizure (which encompasses the right not be abused by the police), the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination (which encompasses the right to remain silent during interrogations), the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments' guarantees of due process (ensuring fundamental fairness in criminal justice system), and the Eighth Amendment's right to be free of cruel or unusual punishment. In numerous cases, the U.S. Supreme Court has condemned the use of force amounting to torture or other forms of ill treatment during interrogations, including such practices as whipping, slapping, depriving a victim of food, water, or sleep, keeping him naked or in a small cell for prolonged periods, holding a gun to his head, or threatening him with mob violence. Torture would also violate state constitutions, whose provisions generally parallel the protections set forth in the federal Bill of Rights. Article 4 of the Convention against Torture obligates state parties to ensure that all acts of torture are criminal offenses under domestic legislation. Although there is no single federal law specifically criminalizing torture, the United States has insisted that existing federal and state laws render illegal any act falling with the Convention against Torture's definition of torture. In the United States, most criminal laws are state rather than federal. Although a few states have laws addressing torture as such, each state has laws that criminalize violence against persons (e.g. assault, rape), regardless of whether committed by public officials or private individuals. In addition, states typically have specific laws that criminalize acts by public officials that constitute abuses of authority, """"official oppression,"""" or the unlawful infliction of bodily injury. The principal federal law that would apply to torture against detainees is 18 U.S.C. 242, which makes it a criminal offense for any public official to willfully to deprive a person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Q: Do non-citizens in the U.S. have the same right not to be tortured as U.S. citizens? Yes. Neither international nor domestic law conditions the right not to be subjected to torture on citizenship or nationality. No detainee held by U.S. authorities—regardless of nationality, regardless of whether held in the U.S. or in another country, and regardless of whether the person is deemed a combatant or civilian—may be tortured. All applicable international law applies to U.S. officials operating abroad, including the Convention against Torture and the Geneva Conventions. The prohibition against torture is universal and covers all countries both regarding U.S. citizens and persons of other nationalities. Q: Can a person be compelled to provide evidence? Using force or the infliction of pain to overcome an individual's desire to maintain silent during interrogations not only violates the victim's right to be free from torture but also his or her right not to speak during an interrogation. The right against being compelled to testify against oneself is contained in Article 14 of the ICCPR. The Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution also affirms the right against self-incrimination. This right has been interpreted to include the right to remain silent during custodial interrogations, regardless of whether the information sought would be incriminating. There are only extremely limited exceptions to the right to remain silent. For example, the threat of imprisonment can be used to lawfully compel a witness to speak in grand jury proceedings provided the witness has been granted some form of immunity, i.e. protection against having the testimony used against him in subsequent criminal proceedings. But these exceptions to the right against self-incrimination do not in any sense permit violations of the separate right to be free of torture. Torture is never permitted to overcome a witness's desire to remain silent. Recognizing the potential for abuse during interrogations, U.S. courts have constructed special rules to diminish the likelihood of coerced testimony. They have, for example, ruled that coerced statements are not admissible at trial—whether they are deemed compelled in violation of the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination or """"involuntary"""" in violation of the right to due process. The U.S. Supreme Court in 1966 also established a rule requiring the police who seek to question detainees to inform them of their """"Miranda"""" rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present during the questioning [Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966)]. In explaining the need for this rule, the Court noted the continuing police practice of using physical force to extract confessions, citing, as an example, a case in which police beat, kicked and burned with lighted cigarette butts a potential witness under interrogation. The Convention against Torture provides that any statement that has been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made. Q: Can limited physical force be used during interrogations? Force can never be used to pressure a detainee to speak, even if it seems only slight or moderate. The absolute injunction against force has practical as well as moral underpinnings. Historical practice shows there is no such thing as a """"little bit"""" of physical pressure to compel someone to speak during an interrogation. Once a degree of force is permitted, interrogators face an overwhelming temptation to continue applying as much force as is necessary to acquire the sought-for information. Q: Is the use of """"truth serums"""" permitted? While the forcible administration of so-called """"truth serums""""—drugs such as sodium pentothal, sodium amytal, and scopolamine —does not involve the infliction of severe pain, its use to secure information from a person would nonetheless be prohibited under international law. Human Rights Watch believes that at a minimum it would violate the person's right to be free from """"inhuman or degrading"""" treatment. We note that Article 2 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture expressly defines torture as including """"the use of methods upon a person intended to obliterate the personality of the victim or to diminish his physical or mental capacities, even if they do not cause physical pain or mental anguish."""" The prohibition against the ill-treatment of persons under interrogation is rooted in respect for human dignity and the inviolability of the human body and mind. To force a person to talk through the application of drugs is as much a denial of human dignity as to coerce talk through the use of physical force. Securing testimony through the involuntary administration of drugs would also violate the right against self-incrimination if it were not done under a grant of use immunity. But even if such immunity were given—thus solving the problem of self-incrimination—drugging would still be prohibited because of its inhuman and degrading nature. Because of its profound compromise of the human personality, the use of drugs is quite different from the forcible taking of physical evidence—hair, blood, DNA, etc.—which is permitted under U.S. and international law. The administration of any of the drugs identified as having the potential for causing a person to talk is an involved medical procedure requiring delivery of the drug intravenously over a period that can range from two to twelve hours. The international Principles of Medical Ethics Relevant to the Role of Health Personnel provide that the participation of doctors or other medical practitioners in the administration of such drugs for interrogation purposes would violate medical ethics. The use of truth serums is not an authorized method of interrogation in the United States. Under U.S. law, confessions made under the influence of truth serums are not """"voluntary"""" and are consequently inadmissible as evidence Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963). Investigators are not severely handicapped by not being able to use """"truth serums."""" While certain drugs may reduce a person's inhibitions against talking, they do not guarantee that the person will in fact tell the truth. Under the influence of such drugs, people may become highly suggestible, picking up cues from the interrogators and agreeing to information that is not true; they may relate fantasies; and they may still be able to deliberately mislead. According to a study by medical and legal experts: """"experimental and clinical findings indicate that only individuals who have conscious and unconscious reasons for doing so are inclined to confess and yield to interrogation under drug influence. On the other hand, some are able to withhold information and some, especially character neurotics, are able to lie. Others are so suggestible they will describe, in response to suggestive questioning, behavior which never in fact occurred....But drugs are not 'truth sera.' They lessen inhibitions to verbalization and stimulate unrepressed expression not only of fact but of fancy and suggestions as well. Thus the material produced is not 'truth' in the sense that it conforms to empirical fact"""" [Dession, Freedman, Donnelly, and Redlich, """"Drug Induced Revelation and Criminal Investigation,"""" 62 Yale L.J. 315, 319 (1953)]. As another expert noted, """"the intravenous injection of a drug by a physician in a hospital may appear more scientific than the drinking of large amounts of bourbon in a tavern, but the end result displayed in the subject's speech may be no more reliable."""" MacDonald, """"Truth Serums,"""" 46 Crim. L.C.& P.S. 259 (1955). U.S. courts have generally ruled the use of truth serums is not a """"trustworthy truth-extracting procedure"""" and have held evidence thus acquired is inadmissible, regardless of whether the drugs were administered voluntarily or involuntarily. E.g., Lindsey v. U.S., 237 F.2d 893, 897 (9th Cir.1956). Q: Are there any situations in which torture is permitted? Under customary international law as well as underinternational human rights treaties, torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment is prohibited at all times and in all circumstances. It is a non-derogable right, one of those core rights that may never be suspended, even during times of war, when national security is threatened, or during other public emergencies. According to the U.S. government, """"U.S. law contains no provision permitting otherwise prohibited acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to be employed on grounds of exigent circumstances (for example, during a """"state of public emergency"""") or on orders from a superior officer or public authority."""" The European Court of Human Rights has applied the prohibition against torture contained in European Convention on Human Rights in several cases involving alleged terrorists. As it noted in one case, """"The Court is well aware of the immense difficulties faced by States in modern times in protecting their communities from terrorist violence. However, even in these circumstances, the Convention prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, irrespective of the victim's conduct."""" (Chahal v. United Kingdom, Nov. 15, 1996) Similarly, the Committee against Torture, reviewing Israel's use of torture as a method of interrogation against suspected Palestinian terrorists, stated, """"The Committee acknowledges the terrible dilemma that Israel confronts in dealing with terrorist threats to its security, but as a State party to the Convention Israel is precluded from raising before this Committee exceptional circumstances as justification for [prohibited] acts"""" [United Nations Committee against Torture. """"Concluding observations of the Committee against Torture"""" (1997), A/52/44,paras.253-260. (15 Nov. 2001).] Q: Shouldn't torture be permitted if its use will save lives? Some people argue that the goal of saving innocent lives must override a person's right not to be tortured. This argument is presented in its starkest form in the """"ticking bomb"""" scenario: a bomb has been set to explode that will kill thousands of people and a detained person is known to have information on where the bomb is and how to defuse it. Is torture justified in such a case to force the detainee to talk? Those who say that it is argue that governments should be permitted to choose torture as the lesser of two evils in such a situation. The international community, however, rejected the use of torture even in the """"ticking bomb"""" case. International human rights law - as well as U.S. law - do not contain any exceptions to the prohibition against torture. There are practical as well as moral reasons for not permitting a """"ticking bomb"""" -or terrorist attack -- exception to the ban on torture. Although such an exception might appear to be highly limited, experience shows that the exception readily becomes the standard practice. For example, how imminent must the attack be to trigger the exception and justify torture - an hour, a week, a year? How certain must the government be that the detainee actually has the necessary information? Under the utilitarian logic that the end (saving many innocent lives) justifies the means, torture should be permitted even if the disaster might not occur until some point in the future, and it should be permitted against as many people as is necessary to secure the information that could be used to avert the disaster. Israel provides a good example of how this logic works in practice. For years Israel justified its use of torture - what it called """"moderate physical force"""" - by citing the """"ticking bomb"""" scenario. But despite a genuine security threat, Israeli security forces rarely if ever were able to identify a particular suspect with knowledge about a particular bomb set to explode imminently. Rather, they ended up applying the scenario metaphorically to justify torturing virtually every Palestinian security detainee - thousands of people - on the theory that they might know something about some unspecified, future terrorist act. In 1999, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the use of torture, although the practice seems to have increased in the past year. In addition, the ticking bomb scenario offers no logical limitations on how much or what kind of torture would be permitted. If the detainee does not talk when shaken or hit, why shouldn't the government move unto more severe measures, such as the application of electric shocks? Why not threaten to rape the suspect's wife or to torture his children? Once torture is allowed, setting limits is extraordinarily difficult. Q: Does the U.S. lose valuable information if torture is prohibited? Torture is as likely to yield false information as it is to yield the truth. Cesare Beccaria, the eighteenth century philosopher whose critique of torture remains influential today, observed that when a person is tortured, the """"impression of pain…may increase to such a degree, that, occupying the mind entirely, it will compel the sufferer to use the shortest method of freeing himself from torment…[H]e will accuse himself of crimes of which he is innocent."""" Beccaria also pointed out the problem of using torture to discover the accused's accomplices: """"Will not the man who [under torture falsely] accuses himself yet more readily accuse others?"""" [Beccaria, Cesare, Of Crimes and Punishments. (15 Nov. 2001).] . Contemporary law enforcement professionals concur. Oliver Ravel, former deputy director of the FBI, has stated that force is not effective: """"people will even admit they killed their grandmother, just to stop the beatings."""" Indeed, the unreliability of forced confessions was one of the principal reasons that U.S. courts originally prohibited their use. The prohibition on torture or other forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading conduct does not leave the government helpless before terrorists. Convictions in recent cases involving terrorism show that investigators currently have the means and legal methods to acquire the evidence necessary for successful prosecutions. Q: May the U.S. send detainees to other countries to be questioned? The United States may not send detainees to another country to be questioned by police or security forces who use torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during their interrogation. Article 3 of the Convention against Torture expressly prohibits sending a person to another state """"where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture."""" Human Rights Watch believes that the U.S. government would be complicit in torture - in essence, aiding and abetting torture - if it sent detainees to another country aware that they might be tortured there. The purpose of U.S. human rights commitments would be circumvented if the U.S. government could effectively subcontract interrogation techniques that it is prohibited from using itself. Q: What are the remedies against torture? Under U.S. law, victims of torture can sue in state or federal court for damages. But there are numerous practical obstacles to such lawsuits - including the difficulty of securing evidence of torture and the financial costs of legal representation - as well as legal and procedural impediments to a successful conclusion. Moreover, even if a case is successful and damages are awarded, the financial compensation does not undo the harm done - the experience of torture and its often ongoing physical, psychological, and emotional consequences. Officials who engage in torture - including those who give the orders as well as those who carry them out - can and should be prosecuted criminally as well as disciplinarily sanctioned. Nevertheless, history counsels that the decision to prosecute public officials, the actual charges brought, and the penalties sought are often influenced by such extra-legal considerations as public sympathy for the victim or support for the officials and the political context in which the crime took place. The best """"remedy"""" for torture is thus prevention. U.S. officials should resolutely resist any temptation or encouragement to use torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment against detainees held and questioned in connection with its campaign against terrorism.","Middle East/North Africa, United States","International Justice"

For more than three decades, the government of President Saddam Hussein has sanctioned the use of the death penalty and extrajudicial executions as a tool of political repression, both in order to eliminate real or suspected political opponents and to maintain a reign of terror over the population at large. The executions that have taken place over this period constitute an integral part of more systematic repression - characterized by widespread arbitrary arrests, indefinite detention without trial, death in custody under torture, and large-scale """"disappearances"""" - through which the government has sustained its rule. Iraq's Penal Code provides for a wide range of both criminal and political capital offences, and decrees passed by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council over the past two decades have periodically widened the scope of the death penalty, claiming hundreds of lives every year. Special courts empowered to impose death sentences have also been established within government ministries outside the framework of the normal judicial system, and procedures in these courts fall far short of international fair trial standards. Notwithstanding the vast array of death penalty laws at its disposal, the Iraqi government also has summarily executed thousands of detainees without trial in what some observers have claimed is a policy of """"prison cleansing."""" Relatives are usually not informed in advance of such executions and are compelled to bury their relatives without funeral rites. Many other relatives are never notified and remain in ignorance of the fate of the prisoners for years; the remains of those executed are buried in unmarked or mass graves.  The death penalty violates the right to life and the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman, or degrading punishment, both of which are recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international human rights instruments. The wide array of offenses subject to capital punishment under Iraqi legislation and Iraqi government practiceÑboth its frequent applications of the death penalty and mass extrajudicial executions of prisonersÑmake Iraq among the world's worst violators of these fundamental rights.1 The government of Iraq should place an immediate stay on all pending death sentences and issue a public and permanent moratorium on any use of the death penalty. At a very minimum, it should declare an end to the use of the death penalty for all but the most serious offenses and work towards full abolition. The government should also conduct a thorough review of existing laws and decrees, temporary and otherwise, to ensure their compliance with Iraq's treaty obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In addition, the government should order a thorough and impartial investigation into credible reports of mass extrajudicial executions of prisoners over the past five years, and bring to justice those officials responsible for ordering and carrying out the so-called """"prison cleansing"""" campaign. The international community should demand such an investigation and, if the government of Iraq fails to do so, be prepared to take steps to establish an international tribunal to prosecute those found responsible.2 The United States or other countries that may, as a consequence of armed intervention, take control of Iraq as the occupying power or powers, should as soon as possible issue a moratorium on the use of the death penalty if the government of Iraq has not already done so. This is imperative, notwithstanding the United States' deplorable record regarding application of the death penalty. Such a step would be in accord with the recommendations made to Iraq by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, and with the international trend toward abolition of the death penalty. It would also be in accord with the policies of other states likely to participate in any such intervention, including the United Kingdom. Until a moratorium comes into effect, any occupying powers should, at a minimum, drastically curtail any application of the death penalty. While the laws of the occupied country generally remain in force during an occupation, occupying powers mush also ensure that their practices accord with international standards regarding the administration of justice. In addition to observing basic judicial and fair trial guarantees, such as the right to counsel and to appeal to a higher judicial body, the occupying power(s) must, under the Geneva Conventions, must ensure that any use of the death penalty is proportionate to the offense and only carried out for the most serious crimes.3 In no circumstances may the death penalty be used against women with young children, pregnant women, or children, defined as persons under eighteen years of age at the time of the offense.4 In addition, no death sentence shall be carried out before the expiration of at least six months from the notification of the judgment confirming such a sentence, and anyone sentenced to death has the right to seek clemency measures.5  Introduction It is not possible to determine with certainty the number of people executed by law or government order in Iraq each year. For the past two decades and with depressing regularity, the reported figures for those executed have run into the hundreds each year and, in some years, have reached several thousand. Many of these estimates are impossible to verify, largely due to the clandestine manner in which the executions are carried out. Except in rare cases, the government generally does not release information concerning death sentences passed or carried out. The complete lack of access to Iraq by human rights investigators renders the process of verification very difficult. Given the secrecy surrounding executions in the country, moreover, in many instances it is not possible to ascertain whether victims have been executed following some form of trial, or whether they have been killed in accordance with an executive order. The Iraqi government has said on record, and continues to reiterate, that it does not implement a policy of executing persons """"for political reasons."""" In support of this assertion, government officials have frequently cited article 20 of Iraq's Penal Code,6 which differentiates between ordinary and political offences, and provides for the commutation of death sentences to life imprisonment in the case of political offences.7 Given documented Iraqi practices, the government's frequent lack of regard for the provisions of its own domestic legislation, and its disregard of its international legal obligations, such an assertion does not stand up to scrutiny.8 The Penal Code continues to provide for the death penalty (in some cases mandatory) for a wide range of both criminal and political offences, which fall into three broad categories: offences deemed to constitute a danger to the public, and those considered damaging to external or internal state security.9 Over the years the government has steadily increased the number and range of capital offences through decrees issued by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), contrary to its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which it ratified without reservation.10 While repeatedly assuring the U.N. Human Rights Committee11 that the death penalty was only applicable to the """"most serious crimes,"""" the government introduced mandatory death sentences for a variety of non-violent political acts. These included a range of offences connected with membership of the ruling Ba'th Party, such as the failure by party members to reveal any previous political affiliation; political activity by former Ba'th Party members with any other party; knowingly recruiting a current or former Ba'th Party member to any other political party; political activity within the armed forces deemed detrimental to the Ba'th Party; and membership of any party other than the Ba'th party by former members of the armed forces.12 Any retired army or police personnel taking part in political activities other than within the Ba'th Party also became liable, with retroactive effect, for the death penalty.13 In 1986, publicly insulting the president of the republic or any officials of the RCC, the Ba'th Party, the National Assembly, or the government, with a view to mobilizing public opinion against the authorities, also became a capital offence.14 Legislation other than the penal code was also amended, or new legislation passed, introducing the death penalty for additional offences.15 The offences in question included desertion from the armed forces in certain cases,16 robbery committed in wartime,17 the smuggling of Iraqi or foreign currency or gold """"with the Persian enemy,""""18 and causing damage to the national economy through the use of forged documents.19 The death penalty was also introduced, with retroactive effect, for membership in al-Da'wa al-Islamiyya (Islamic Call), a Shi'a Muslim opposition group.20  Widening the scope of the death penalty  All these capital offences were introduced during the 1970s and 1980s and remain on the statute books.21 A range of other capital offences were introduced in the first half of the 1990s, many of them relating to economic crimes. The government sought to justify these by saying that the humanitarian crisis resulting from the imposition of sanctions on the country directly spurred a rise in the level of crime, with the worsening of economic hardship and poverty. In its fourth periodic report to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, submitted in November 1996, the government referred to """"the exceptional circumstances through which Iraq is passing,"""" arguing that """"if the human individual's right to life has become a principle of international law, it is befitting that the conscience of the international community should be stirred to protect the right to life of the entire Iraqi people, who are being subjected to virtual genocide"""" by economic sanctions.22 The government pointed to theft, armed robbery, embezzlement, and bribery as being among the most serious crimes whose rates had increased due to economic hardships caused by economic sanctions. """"Consequently, in order to protect the public interest and the legal and economic security of society, the legislature was forced to adopt heavier penalties not as a strict matter of principle but primarily as a public deterrent to protect the right of society to security, which has become a form of struggle for survival, since the adoption of heavier penalties is not part of the criminal policy of the Iraqi legislature.""""23 In this spirit, car theft became a capital offence in 1992,24 as did the offence of manufacturing or circulating counterfeit currency the following year.25 Subsequently, a series of decrees passed by the RCC widened even more extensively the scope of the death penalty, making it a mandatory punishment in most cases and having retroactive effect in one case. All but one of these decrees was passed in 1994. The new capital offences included:  Sabotage of the national economy (Decree 39 of April 2, 1994). The offences specified in this decree relate to the possession or trade in medicines and medical equipment.26 The penalty is death or life imprisonment. Theft committed with a weapon or resulting in the death of another person (Decree 59 of June 4, 1994).27 The death penalty for this offense was mandatory until 2001, when it was replaced by """"the maximum term of imprisonment established by the provisions of the penal laws in force.""""28 Smuggling of antiquities from archeological sites or on a scale resulting in damage to the national economy (Decree 76 of June 29, 1994).29 The death penalty is mandatory. Premeditated crimes punishable by not less than fifteen years' imprisonment committed by members of the internal or special security forces (Decree 91 of July 21, 1994).30 The death penalty is mandatory. Smuggling of cars, trucks, and certain construction machinery outside Iraq or to a hostile party (Decree 95 of July 27, 1994). The death penalty is mandatory. Theft, embezzlement, forgery of official documents, and bribery committed by military personnel (Decree 111 of August 23, 1994). The penalty is death or life imprisonment. Deserting from the army on three occasions or providing cover or shelter for a deserter on three occasions (Decree 115 of August 25, 1994).31 The death penalty is mandatory, and the decree has retroactive effect with respect to past offenders who fail to surrender to the authorities within the period stipulated in the decree.32 Organizing a group for the purposes of pimping or procurement (Decree 118 of August 27).33 The death penalty is mandatory. Loss of life caused by a member of the armed forces, internal security forces, or a government employee in circumstances other than those stipulated in Decree 59 of 1994 mentioned above (Decree 114 of September 5, 1994).34 Falsification of military service documents (Decree 179 of October 8, 1994). The death penalty for this offence was abolished in January 2003 and replaced with a term of imprisonment ranging between ten and fifteen years.35 Engaging in fraudulent investments during wartime or while economic sanctions remain in force, or if they result in the undermining of the economy (Decree 16 of February 27, 1995).  Special courts  Several of these decrees also provided for the establishment of special courts within government ministries, empowered to hear cases and impose death sentences outside the framework of the normal judicial system. For example, suspects accused of damaging the national economy under Decree 39/1994 are tried by a special tribunal within the Ministry of Interior, while a similar court within the Ministry of Defense hears cases of embezzlement, forgery, and bribery committed by military personnel under Decree 111/1994. The relevant minister appoints the court bench in each case. Other special courts were also established within the intelligence and security services, namely the General Security Directorate (Mudiriyyat al-Amn al-ÔAam) and the main intelligence apparatus, the Mukhabarat. The enactment of such legislation, which blatantly violates Iraq's own constitution as well as its international legal obligations, is not unique. Indeed, these RCC decrees coincided with the extension of law enforcement powers in others spheres, including giving officials within the Ba'th Party and the National Assembly the power to detain without trial individuals accused of certain offences for up to three years,36 and giving the head of the Presidency Office (Diwan al-Ri'asa) judicial powers to initiate crime investigations.37 In its fourth periodic report the Iraqi government, while conceding the existence of a """"Special Court,"""" made no mention of these many extra-legal procedures. It did, however, link the existence of a special court to what it said was an increased crime rate resulting directly from the effects of economic sanctions, which """"induced the legislature [to form] a Special Court, presided over by a civil court judge, in which defendants are prosecuted by a public prosecutor from a civil court.""""38 The court's proceedings were said to follow Iraq's penal code and code of criminal procedure, with its jurisdiction limited to the following:  Cases referred to it by the Minister of Interior. Cases of vehicle theft associated with murder or violence. Offences committed by gangs that steal vehicles and smuggle them out of the country. Highway robbery. Offences that, by law, must be referred to the Special Court. Economic offences that are referred to the Special Court by the Office of the President of the Republic.39  In January 2003, a new law was passed establishing a state security court and providing for the abolition of the special courts.40 According to Iraqi officials, the state security court falls within the jurisdiction of the ministry of justice and the existing Code of Criminal Procedure governs its proceedings.41 The minister announces appointments to the court's three-member bench and to the post of prosecutor general, subject to approval by the Presidency Council. The court is empowered to hear cases involving a wide range of offences (some of which carry the death penalty): crimes against the internal and external security of the state, drug-related offences, trafficking in women, and child prostitution, as well as cases pending from the special courts. At the time of writing, Human Rights Watch could not verify whether the special courts had in fact been abolished, and had no further information on the functioning of the state security court.  Iraq and U.N. human rights mechanisms In their consideration of Iraq's fourth periodic report,42 members of the Human Rights Committee pointed out that the """"Special Court"""" proceedings were incompatible with the provisions of article 14(5) of the ICCPR,43 given that the decisions of these courts were final and not subject to appeal. They also expressed grave concern about the imposition of the death penalty for other than """"the most serious crimes,"""" as required by article 6 of the ICCPR, and that punishment in certain cases was not commensurate with the offence committed. One such offence, for example, was the smuggling of antiquities (Decree 39/1994), to which the Iraqi government's representative responded by saying that the destruction of his country's cultural heritage qualified as a serious crime.44 Another example was the imposition of the death penalty for the theft of drugs by members of the medical profession, regarding which the government representative said that it was necessary to protect medical supplies due to shortages caused by economic sanctions.45 He added that """"the problem hardly ever arose in practice since such punishments were carried out only in exceptional cases,"""" but provided no data to back up his claim. 46 A third example was the imposition of the death penalty for insulting the president of the republic (Decree 840/1986). Here, the government representative said: """"In itself, the crime was not sufficient for the imposition of the death penalty: it must have been aimed at inciting armed conflict or revolt. The crime was not one of lese-majestŽe [sic]; rather it was a crime against the security of the State, the President serving as the symbol of that security.""""47 The Human Rights Committee also expressed concern about the retroactivity of death penalty legislation, namely Decree 115/1994, since it violated article 15 of the ICCPR. The government representative said the decree """"was not precisely retroactive. Certain crimes known as continuing crimes, required time for the relevant legislation to be applied. Thus, if somebody were to drive a vehicle without a license in 1991, for example, and to be arrested for that offence in 1992, he would be liable to a penalty under the legislation in effect at the time of the arrest rather than the time of the offence. Since the offence was in a sense ongoing, the penalty could not be regarded as retroactive.""""48 In defending the enactment of this legislation, the Iraqi government's representative said that while these laws """"might appear to be extremely severe, [they] were essentially of a deterrent nature, and that only rarely were the punishments envisaged actually carried out.""""49 However, the government failed to provide, as requested by the Human Rights Committee, data on the number of persons sentenced to death, the number of executions carried out, and the number of people who benefited from amnesties.50 Neither has the government ever made public, to Human Rights Watch's knowledge, any data on crime figures from which a determination could be made as to whether such draconian laws had indeed had a deterrent effect. Additionally, and in contradiction to the government's assertion that special courts were subject to the same legislation as ordinary criminal courts, its fourth periodic report stated that """"the decrees in question would all be abrogated as soon as the situation in the country returned to normal when the Penal Code could once again be applied.""""51 In respect of the death penalty and related special courts, the Human Rights Committee expressed concern in its concluding observations about the following:52  The incompatibility of some of the provisions of these decrees with certain non-derogable rights under the ICCPR, including the right to life and the non-retroactivity of criminal laws. The increase in the categories of crimes punishable by the death penalty, and that the new categories include non-violent and economic offenses. The fact that special courts, empowered to impose the death penalty, violate procedural guarantees required by article 14 of the ICCPR, in particular the right of appeal. The discretionary authority of the Minister of the Interior and the Office of the President of the Republic to refer to the special courts cases additional to those listed as being within their jurisdiction.  The Human Rights Committee recommended """"a thorough review of existing temporary laws and decrees"""" to ensure their compliance with the provisions of the ICCPR; that Iraq abolish the death penalty """"for crimes which are not among the most serious crimes, in accordance with article 6, paragraph 2, of the Covenant, and that total abolition of the death penalty be considered""""; that the application of Decree 115/1994, which has retroactive effect,53 be suspended without delay and steps taken to repeal it; and that courts exercising criminal jurisdiction be in full compliance with all procedural safeguards protected by article 14 of the ICCPR, including the right of appeal. In recent communications with U.N. Special Rapporteur on Iraq, Andreas Mavrommatis, the Iraqi government for the first time provided limited data on the use of the death penalty. It stated that a total of 157 persons were executed in 2000. Of these, 106 were for the crimes of homicide and homicide accompanied by robbery, forty for drug-related offences, and eleven for """"immoral offences (rape of a close female blood relative).""""54 For 2001, the government gave a total figure of 106 executions, of which sixty-three were for homicide and homicide accompanied by robbery, forty for drug-related offences, and three for immoral offences.55 No figures for other categories of capital offences were given. The government also provided some data on the number of prisoners whose death sentences it said had been commuted to terms of imprisonment. Among them were prisoners who had been convicted under the now-repealed Decree 59/1994 (see above), of whom forty-six had their sentences commuted in 2001 and seventeen in 2002. A further twenty-one prisoners were said to have had their death sentences commuted in 2001-2001 under the terms of presidential or """"discretionary"""" decrees.56 Other information requested by the special rapporteur, including the names of those executed, the dates of their trials, appeals, and executions, the charges against them, and the legislation under which they were tried and sentenced, was not provided.57 During his visit to Iraq in February 2002,58 the special rapporteur raised a number of related issues with government officials, notably Minister of Justice Mundhir al-Shawi. On the question of the scope of the death penalty, the minister said that """"the Penal Code of Iraq exclusively regulated the application of the death penalty,"""" and that """"there were no other general laws which imposed the death sentence: however, certain legislation might be promulgated increasing the sentence for a specific crime, listed in the Penal Code, to capital punishment.""""59 As an example, he said that the maximum sentence for organized crime had recently been increased to capital punishment. He added that """"if specific circumstances justified such a step,"""" the death penalty for offences not listed in the Penal Code could be introduced by presidential decree.60 In May 2002, the Iraqi government informed the special rapporteur that at a meeting of the Council of Ministers on October 29, 2001, President Saddam Hussein had ordered a review of the death penalty, """"with a view to replacing it by penalties involving deprivation of liberty or appropriate financial penalties.""""61 A committee composed of four ministers - justice, labor, social affairs, and religious endowments - was apparently charged with the task of drafting a report on the issue for consideration by the Council of Ministers. No information has emerged to date on this review. Government officials told the special rapporteur that special courts applied the provisions of the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure, that defendants had the right to appoint defense lawyers of their choice, and that they were guaranteed a fair trial. On the question of appeals, officials said that verdicts """"are reviewed by a special judicial committee, which acts as an appeal body.""""62 Officials had previously told the Human Rights Committee that the decisions of the special court set up in the aftermath of the imposition of economic sanctions were """"irrevocable.""""63  Mass executions and """"prison cleansing"""" In addition to death sentences imposed under the array of capital punishment laws described above, only two of which are known to have been abrogated to date,64 mass executions of detainees continue to be carried out by executive order. In the past five years, in particular, there have been numerous reports of the execution of inmates held at several prisons in the country carried out by executive order. Such information has come from the relatives of victims living abroad and former inmates held in prisons where executions have taken place, as well as Iraqi opposition groups.65 In most cases it was not possible to independently verify these reports due in large part to the secrecy surrounding many executions, and the failure of authorities to notify family members of death sentences passed or subsequently to hand over the remains of the victims. However, testimony from a wide range of sources has consistently supported the existence of mass executions, particularly in some of the more notorious prisons. The majority of victims appear to have been suspected political opponents held without charge or trial (some for periods ranging between ten and fifteen years). They are also believed to include political prisoners sentenced to terms of imprisonment who were not released upon expiry of sentence, prisoners awaiting a ruling after appealing their conviction, and prisoners convicted for criminal offences. The reported frequency and large-scale nature of executions at prisons such as Abu Ghraib and al-Radhwaniyya have given rise to fears that they may be part of a policy of """"prison cleansing"""" by the authorities, aimed at eliminating suspected political opponents and easing overcrowding in the country's prisons. Both Human Rights Watch66 and Max van der Stoel,67 during his term as special rapporteur on Iraq, repeatedly have received reports of such mass executions, particularly since 1997.   In the past two years, testimony by former intelligence officers and other state employees who have fled Iraq has corroborated reports of mass executions in prisons. Captain Khalid Sajit al-Janabi, who was an intelligence operative from 1979 to 1999, attested to the existence of a government prison cleansing policy. 68 He testified in November 2000 that a directive issued in 1998 effectively authorized the mass execution of prisoners. He stated: """"On 15 March 1998 we were advised of a Revolutionary Command Council decision to clean up the prisons. The Presidency Office and the Special Security Forces ordered the security services to set up a committee comprising representatives from Military Intelligence, Public Security, Special Security and the Mukhabarat to act as a supervisory body at Abu Ghraib prison."""" Al-Janabi said that he and three other officers were assigned to Abu Ghraib prison on March 20. According to his testimony, President Saddam Hussein's son Qusay toured the prison on April 26 and issued an order for the execution of an estimated 2,000 inmates held in one section. """"At six the following morning, the executions began. By nine that evening, 2,000 Iraqis had been executed. Most of them were from the South, accused of joining parties and taking part in [opposition] activities É some were hanged, while others were shot. Each victim was shot once in the head."""" Al-Janabi said many of the bodies were then buried in the nearby al-Karkh cemetery, identified only by a serial number. The former director of the Abu Ghraib prison hospital, Maher Fakher al-Khashan, who fled Iraq in July 2001, attested to regular mass executions of prisoners. Al-Khashan said that most of those executed were political detainees identified by serial number rather than by name, whose bodies were removed for burial in special vehicles, and that he had most recently witnessed thirty-four such executions on July 8, 2001. He reported that prison authorities forced doctors to inject some detainees with poison and then issue death certificates attributing their deaths to natural causes. In a six-month period between October 1999 and March 2000, an estimated 233 inmates were reportedly executed in various prisons, in most cases by hanging. They included twenty-six political detainees executed on November 26, 1999, and a further twenty-six executed on January 27, 2000, all in Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. The majority were Shi'a Muslims from Basra, al-Samawa, al-Nasiriyya, al-Diwaniyya, al-Hilla, al-ÔAmara, and Baghdad, some of whom had been held without judicial due process since 1991 on suspicion of having participated in the March 1991 uprising. The bodies of the victims were reportedly buried in mass graves near the prison. The authorities also reportedly executed many inmates at Abu Ghraib, al-Makasib, and other prisons in 1999, including long-term political detainees and convicted prisoners. Some were apparently tortured first. Relatives reported that the body of 'Abd al-Wahed al-Rifa'i, hanged in March after two years in detention without trial, bore marks of torture when they collected it on March 26 from the General Security Directorate in Baghdad. Thirteen other detainees at Abu Ghraib Prison, including students, were executed in August 2001, and twenty-one prisoners convicted by special courts of killing several security agents were executed two months later, including Falah Ahmad Hussain, Muhsin Yassin Kadhim, and Baqer Jassim 'Ali. Between March and July 2002, at least fifty-eight people were reported to have been executed, among them thirty-three political detainees who had been held at Abu Ghraib prison. They included Khalil Baqer Hashem from Baghdad, executed on June 23; Salman Muhsin ÔAbed from al-Najaf, executed in mid-July; and Khaz'al Ibrahim Naji from Dhi Qar, executed in mid-July. In some instances, the families of the victims were not informed of the executions for several months after they were carried out. They were reportedly barred from examining the mortal remains of their relatives and prevented from performing traditional burial rites. There have also been numerous executions, usually by firing squad, of military personnel reported in recent years, following alleged coup attempts. On December 29, 1999, five Republican Guard officers were reportedly executed after being accused of complicity in the alleged attempted murder of President Saddam Hussain's younger son, Qusay. Among them were Lieutenant Colonel Ibrahim Jassem and Captain ÔUmar Abdul Razzaq. In May 2000 four officers belonging to the Special Security Forces, among them staff colonels Kadhim Jawad ÔAli and ÔAli Muhammad Salman, were reported to have been executed. In March 2001, three air force officers, including Fawzi Hamed al-'Ubaidi and Faris Ahmad al-'Alwan, and an army major general, Tareq al-Sa'dun, were reportedly executed following an alleged coup attempt. In July 2001 the authorities executed two air force officers in Kirkuk, including Kadhim Khairallah al-Dulaimi, and at least five Republican Guard officers, including Staff Colonel Sami Abd al-Ghaffur al-Alusi. In August and October 2001 a number of military personnel were executed at Abu Ghraib prison. The victims included former army colonels ÔAbd al-Salam Hadi al-Tikriti and Saleh Manna' Salman al-Tikriti, detained since 1995 and executed on October 8, 2001. They were among a larger group of senior military personnel reportedly arrested in Baghdad in the latter half of 2001. In mid-November 2001, twenty-two other military personnel were reportedly executed in the same period in Abu Ghraib prison. Among them were Staff Colonel Sa'eb ÔAbdullah al-Samarra'i, Lieutenant Colonel ÔAqil Tale' al-Nu'aimi, Major Yassin Hamid Salem and First Lieutenant Bassem ÔAbdullah Mahmoud. In March 2002 at least nine military personnel were executed in several separate incidents, among them Brigadier General Muhammad ÔAbdullah Shahin from Mosul and an officer, ÔAbdul-Haq Isma'il from Babel.  Recommendations Human Rights Watch urges the government of Iraq to:  Place an immediate stay on all executions and impose a moratorium on any further death sentences and further extensions of the death penalty. Commute all pending death sentences to terms of imprisonment. Conduct a thorough review of the Penal Code, resolutions and decrees passed by the Revolutionary Command Council and other legislation providing for the death penalty, to ensure their compliance with Iraq's treaty obligations under the ICCPR. These include the right to a fair trial within a reasonable time, immediate access to defense counsel, adequate time and facilities to prepare a defense, the presumption of innocence, protection from torture and ill-treatment and the right of detainees not to incriminate themselves. Pending abolition of the death penalty and as part of this review, develop clear sentencing criteria for cases where courts are empowered to pass death sentences, repeal laws or decrees that provide the death penalty for crimes that are not among the most serious offences, and abolish all special or ad hoc courts empowered to impose the death penalty, including the newly established state security court. Make public on a regular basis all information about the use of the death penalty, including the number of death sentences passed and carried out, and complete information on the names and cases of those convicted by the courts. Ensure that the relatives of prisoners under sentence of death are kept fully informed at all stages of the proceedings, and that relatives are informed without delay of when and where executions were carried out. Enable relatives to collect the prisoner's remains and to bury them without hindrance or restrictions. Ensure compensation for the relatives of executed prisoners who were subjected to torture or ill-treatment. Order a thorough and impartial investigation into all credible reports of mass extrajudicial execution of prisoners over the past five years, and bring to justice those officials found responsible for ordering and carrying out the so-called """"prison-cleansing"""" campaign. Provide comprehensive information to the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and to the U.N. special rapporteur on Iraq on the use of the death penalty and on any steps taken in implementation of their recommendations to the government of Iraq.  1 The death penalty is a state-sanctioned act of violence, and in Iraq is often accompanied by torture during pre-trial detention and manifestly unfair trials. Its widespread use in Iraq, moreover, has taken place in an international context in which international human rights standards have progressively placed ever-tighter restrictions on the scope of the death penalty, with a view to its eventual abolition. These international instruments include the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, aimed at the abolition of the death penalty, and the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which excluded the death penalty for grave crimes within its jurisdiction - war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. 2 See Human Rights Watch, """"Justice for Iraq,"""" A Human Rights Watch Policy Paper, December 17, 2002. 3 Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 67. 4 Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 68. 5 Fourth Geneva Convention, Article 75. 6 Law No. 111 of 1969 as amended. 7 The Penal Code defines political offences as those """"committed with a political motive or which are prejudicial to general or individual political rights"""" (article 21a). 8 What the Iraqi government has usually omitted to clarify in this context is that article 21(a) of the Penal Code also makes an exception in the case of certain offences which may have been committed with a political motive, but which nevertheless remain liable to the death penalty. These include not only violent offences such as premeditated murder, terrorist offences, or an attempt on the life of the president of the republic, but also other crimes described as """"immoral,"""" such as theft, embezzlement, forgery, breach of trust, fraud, bribery, and indecent assault. Also included in this category are """"offences committed with a base and selfish motive,"""" which are not specified and thus remain wide open to interpretation in each case. 9 Capital offences deemed damaging to internal state security include membership of Zionist or Masonic institutions or the propagation of such ideas (article 201). 10 Iraq ratified the ICCPR in January 1971, and became bound by its provisions in March 1976 when it came into force. 11 The U.N.

Congo: Civilians at Risk of Revenge Killings in Ituri","","03/10/2003","(New York) - All parties involved in the renewed combat in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) must prevent killings and other abuses of civilians by their troops, Human Rights Watch said today. A coalition of local combatants supported by Ugandan army soldiers ousted the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) from the town of Bunia on March 6. The UPC, generally identified with the Hema ethnic group, opposes political and military groups associated with the Lendu and the Ngiti.  In years of war to control this resource-rich region, various local forces and their more powerful supporters have frequently targeted civilians seen as supporters of other contenders. Assailants often kill on an ethnic basis: the UPC is generally identified with the Hema while other parties are linked to the Lendu and the Ngiti.  “Many military operations in this area have turned into slaughter of civilians or other kinds of abuses, like rape, torture and pillage,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “Military commanders and the political leaders who give them orders have the power to prevent such violations of international law and must do so.”  The UPC, supported by Ugandan army forces until several months ago, is now allied with the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma), itself closely identified with the Rwandan government. Uganda and Rwanda have been struggling to control eastern DRC since 1998. To counter the UPC shift to forces allied with Rwanda, Uganda is now sponsoring a new group, the Front for Peace and Integration in Ituri (FIPI) combining Lendu, Alur and dissatisfied Hema.  The government of Uganda, involved through the presence of its troops, and the government of Rwanda, connected to the struggle through its close partner RCD-Goma, must use their influence to get local actors to protect civilian lives, Human Rights Watch said. Donor nations and other African nations, like South Africa, heavily involved in diplomatic efforts to end the war, should also convey to local actors the importance of avoiding killings and other abuses of civilians.  “Everyone has a responsibility to help prevent further abuse to this devastated population,” said Des Forges","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

This memorandum identifies possible preventative measures to be taken both before and during a conflict to lessen the negative impact of cluster munitions on civilian populations, and cites steps that some States have already taken. This memorandum also updates information provided to delegates by Human Rights Watch in May 2002 regarding global use, production, stockpiling and trade in cluster munitions. Human Rights Watch calls on CCW States Parties and other nations to adopt appropriate preventative measures at the national level, and to build up a body of “best practices” that could be implemented by other states. Human Rights Watch also urges States Parties to engage in a serious and in-depth discussion on submunitions and on international humanitarian law, as described in the mandate agreed to in December 2002. These discussions should lead to a new mandate to negotiate a legally-binding instrument aimed specifically at cluster munitions.","Global","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

Antonio Juan Baseotto. I understand that Mons. Baseotto personally requested the meeting with the justices and that the sole topic discussed was the court's forthcoming decision concerning the Full Stop and Due Obedience laws, which several lower court judges have declared null and unconstitutional in decisions that have been unanimously ratified by the Federal Appeals Court and upheld by the Attorney General of the Nation. At the start of the meeting Mons. Baseotto reportedly said that he had come on behalf of his congregation to intercede for national unity and reconciliation.   During the meeting, Justice Vázquez is said to have reassured the army bishop by saying: """"don't worry. We will get the verdict out very soon. This court has already said that the laws are constitutional. We are tired of judges who don't respect the precedents and are scared of the press.""""   I am most surprised that the court you preside did not decline to discuss with the army bishop sensitive matters affecting members or ex-members of the armed forces that are currently under the court's jurisdiction. Moreover, it is absolutely impermissible for a supreme court justice to anticipate a court verdict by making known the court's thinking before the sentence is announced, let alone express negative opinions about colleagues with whom he disagrees on the issue in question.   I deeply regret that the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to Justice Vásquez presented by one of the parties to one of the case, on the grounds that his comments did not constitute an expression of opinion on the case.   The case before the Supreme Court is of the utmost importance, indeed it is crucial to the future of Argentine democracy. The court must reaffirm or deny the right to justice, a right enshrined in human right treaties to which Argentina is a party and which has the status of constitutional law in Argentina.   The State is obliged under these treaties to guarantee respect for human rights by preventing violations, investigating them when they occur, bringing to justice and punishing their perpetrators, and providing reparations for the damage they cause. Failure to meet this obligation amounts to a denial of justice, and, therefore, to impunity. In the words of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, impunity """"fosters chronic repetition of human rights violations, and the total defenselessness of victims and their relatives."""" (Case of Paniagua Morales et al., Judgment of March 8, 1998).   Moreover, the obligation to bring to justice those responsible for gross violations of human rights cannot be delegated or renounced. The incompatibility of amnesty laws with this obligation was implicitly recognized by the World Conference on Human Rights held under the auspices of the United Nations in June 1993. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has repeatedly reaffirmed that such laws are incompatible with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Argentina ratified in 1986.   The Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled in 2001 that """"it is unacceptable to use amnesty provisions, statutes of limitation or measures designed to remove criminal liability as a means of preventing the investigation and punishment of those responsible for gross violations of human rights such as torture, summary, extralegal or arbitrary executions and disappearances."""" Although this ruling applied to Peru (the Barrios Altos case), it is equally applicable to Argentina.   In view of the concerns I have expressed about undue pressures on the court and the apparent prejudgment of the issues by some of its members, I would urge you to ensure that the court base its decision solely on legal principles, and take full account of the decisions of human rights treaty bodies and the jurisprudence of international tribunals on the matters in question.   Thank you for attention to these important matters.   Yours sincerely,     José Miguel Vivanco Executive Director   Cc: Dr. Eduardo A.

Preparations for ballot stuffing appeared to begin on the eve of the elections. According to Aravot and Haykakan Zhamanak, two mainstream newspapers, pre-stamped ballot papers, marked in favor of Kocharian, were in circulation prior to the vote. Demirchian’s campaigners obtained such ballots and showed them to numerous international observers.  Human Rights Watch received eyewitness testimony about ballot stuffing by election officials or by groups of young men, who entered polling stations, bringing sheaves of ballot papers with them. Some opposition officials were assaulted:  In the north Yerevan suburb of Avan, voters reported to Human Rights Watch seeing young men beating an opposition proxy, after she tried to prevent ballot stuffing at polling station 0007/1. In another Avan polling station (0004/1), opposition official Alexander Pirumov told Human Rights Watch that the chairman of the polling station assaulted him—with the help of police—when he tried to prevent two young men from stuffing wads of ballot papers into the box.  Human Rights Watch viewed video footage of a shaken opposition proxy in Echmiadzin (a town fifteen kilometers from Yerevan), showing a sheaf of ballot papers pre-marked in favor of Kocharian that she had managed to prevent from being stuffed into ballot boxes. Allegedly, the chairwoman of her polling station pulled her by the hair and a group of young men kicked her when she tried to prevent the latter from stuffing the ballots into the box. Many other ballots, though, were stuffed into the box. Election commissions at many polling stations ejected opposition officials and proxies who attempted to resist ballot stuffing and other fraud, or summoned the police to deal with them:  At 1:00 p.m., local human rights defenders and journalists oversaw the reinstatement of Adrine Avakian, an opposition member of the election commission at a central Yerevan polling station (0325), after she was allegedly manhandled and thrown out the door an hour before. Other officials continued to threaten her in the presence of Human Rights Watch researchers, saying, “Stop messing with us or we’ll show you!”  At polling station 0014/1 in Avan, the number of ballots cast exceeded by several hundred the number of registered voters. When opposition officials and proxies tried to record the irregularity, police allegedly fired warning shots and detained the officials, holding them overnight. The Demirchian campaign told Human Rights Watch that in the evening, police, fellow election commission members, and unidentified thugs at many polling stations had bullied Demirchian’s commission members and proxies or thrown them out of the polling stations altogether, making it impossible for them to monitor the vote count.  In an unusually strong statement issued yesterday at a press conference in Yerevan, the International Election Observation Mission, consisting of monitors from the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, said the election fell short of international standards, and cited “widespread incidence of ballot stuffing throughout the country.” Lord Russell-Johnston—the head of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe delegation within the mission, said that ballot stuffing took place even in front of Council of Europe observers.  After the first-round voting, held February 19, police arrested up to two hundred opposition campaign officials and supporters in a clumsy attempt to intimidate and disable the opposition prior to the run-off. Some opposition election commission members and proxies complained to Human Rights Watch of escalating threats and pressure in the days before the runoff. One claimed: “They tried to bribe me. When that didn’t work they said, ‘You know we’ll win all the same. And you know what will happen to all of you then.’” Another said he received a phone call on March 4, during which the unidentified caller said, “Your son is in the army. Bear in mind what could happen to him.” A political activist—whose daughter, in her eighth month of pregnancy, had been taken hostage by police on February 23 to secure his detention—complained to Human Rights Watch of twelve threatening phone calls on March 4.  Pressure on opposition activists has included several waves of arrests on administrative and criminal charges during the last two weeks; arrests continued on election day, when, among others, a former mayor of Yerevan was detained. Opposition activists in areas where Kocharian fared badly in the first round appear to have been particularly targeted.  The International Election Observation Mission had also expressed concern over serious problems and irregularities in the February 19 first-round vote count, and its lack of transparency.  On March 4, police detained Ashot Pogosian, the deputy chief of the Demirchian campaign for Yerevan’s Shengavit district, for allegedly intimidating people in his district. He was detained as he was returning from a meeting with a lawyer to discuss the February 23 detention and possible whereabouts of Romik Mkhitarian, the Demirchian campaign chief for that district. The charges against Mkhitarian are unknown. He was detained, along with several others, while riding in the Shengavit district in an automobile belonging to the Demirchian campaign that was equipped with loudspeakers.  At yesterday’s International Election Observation Mission press conference, Lord Russell Johnston deplored the Armenian authorities’ use of administrative detention against opposition activists as “a misuse of law.”  Up to one hundred opposition activists were handed fifteen-day terms of imprisonment throughout the last two weeks under Armenia’s controversial Soviet-era Code of Administrative Offenses, for alleged public order violations. Some were released on and after March 1, but many throughout the country remain in custody. In September 2002, the Council of Europe called on Armenia to repeal the code, citing its abusive enforcement. Information on the detainees’ whereabouts has not been given; they were sentenced in closed sessions without recourse to lawyers, and have had no possibility to appeal their sentences.","Europe/Central Asia, Armenia",""

The women, who worked for the Liberian organization Merci, were given a """"choice"""" by the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) of either joining them as fighters or becoming """"wives"""" of rebel soldiers. All of them were physically, sexually and psychologically abused.   Refugees now resident in Sierra Leone who fled Liberia between July and October 2002 also provided eyewitness accounts that LURD forces systematically imposed forced labor on threat of wounding or death.

""""The treatment of these women is just one example of the terrible abuses being committed by LURD,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division at Human Rights Watch. """"Such crimes must stop.""""   Human Rights Watch has also documented that armed forces loyal to President Charles Taylor have continued to commit massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law, including summary executions; indiscriminate killing of civilians; intentional targeting of civilian areas; widespread rape and other kinds of sexual violence including sexual slavery; abduction and """"disappearance"""" of both adults and minors; illegal detention; torture; forced recruitment; and forced labor.

The members of government and rebel forces responsible for this pattern of ongoing violations continue to operate with total impunity, devastating the Liberian civilian population and challenging the fragile peace of Liberia's neighbors - Côte d'Ivoire, Sierra Leone and Guinea. In the context of the new armed conflict in the sub-region, these ongoing violations threaten not only those who remain in Liberia, but also those refugees who had previously fled to Côte d'Ivoire.   The Liberian government and, to a lesser but still significant extent, the LURD forces, have continued to systematically violate their obligations under international law. Both have been repeatedly called upon to protect civilians and cease any and all violations of human rights and humanitarian law, and both have consistently failed to do so.   """"If the international community insists on turning a blind eye to the brutality which continues in Liberia, the stability of the entire region will be threatened,"""" said Takirambudde.

A soldier named Noa took everything from her, including her ID card, clothes, and slippers. """"I cried and begged them to release me, but the child soldiers forced me to go into the car.""""   They arrived the following day in Lofa bush. The soldiers had already divided the survivors amongst themselves in the car. A rebel named Nostar had chosen A.Z. """"When we arrived, they told us that we would be given to a man. I refused, I told them that I was already committed and did not want break my vow. Then they asked me to be a fighter. I said no, I am a nurse, not a soldier."""" During the first two weeks, she stayed at general Massa's house [a female rebel] together with two of the other captured nurses, C.X. and B.Y. General Massa insisted that she become a fighter or be turned to a man. She asked to be given more time to decide. """"It was a tough time in the Lofa bush. We had no rest. There were attacks and fights against government troops during the day, and harassment, drugs and smoke during the night. At that time, we were still resisting. They already had E.V. and D.W.

""""One night, around 10h30-11h00pm, Moton [one officer] sent a child soldier to get me. I told the boy to inform Moton that I was not there. I hid in the bathroom until 2h00am.

He verbally abused me and my family, saying that my husband was a government worker. He beat me and undressed me. I was naked in front of them. Moton was sitting and watching the scene.""""   """"I remember the date; it was July 6th, a Saturday, when they said that we would be trained"""". The rebels gave trousers to C.X., B.Y., and A.Z., and carried them to the bushes for military training. The rebels shot around their legs and in the air, and forced them to exercise. After the training, general Massa told them that, as they were weak and could not fight, they had to get married.   A.Z. went and lived with Nostar. """"He was always on drugs. Almost everyone was afraid of him. During the night, he would point a gun at me and say that if I would not have sex with him, he would kill me. He was also carrying a grenade on his belt.

The survivors stayed one week at the LURD's headquarters. """"There, the leaders tried to apologize. They said that what happened is because of the war.

Nostar signed for A.Z. and me.""""   """"One night, I was lying in Nostar's house. Gonda came to look for me. He wanted me to go to his house. I said no. He pulled out his gun and forced me to go with him. Inside his house, he ordered me to lie down or he would kill me. I said that I wanted to use the bathroom. He did not want to let me go because he knew I would run away. He asked a child soldier to escort me. I ran to general Massa's place with the child soldier. I told her what happened. She told me to stay in her house and to lie down. At that point, C.X. entered naked into Massa's house [see below]. I was lying on the bed when Gonda arrived. He told me to get up and brought me outside the house. P.Y.G. [a high-ranking officer] was standing outside. He asked me: who brought you from Sinje to Lofa bush? I answered that I was captured by a group of people. Gonda said no. He said that he captured me so I belonged to him. P.Y.G. agreed. Gonda told a group of child soldiers to carry me to his place. They assaulted me and undressed me [in the living room].   Gonda approached me. He shot between my legs and around me. All soldiers stood beside him with their gun. He raped me."""" Afterward Gonda ordered her to go to the bedroom so that she could sleep with him. She said she needed to go to the bathroom [located outside the house]. She met general Massa directly outside Gonda's house and told her that she had been treated like a slave. """"Gonda came and told general Massa to leave me alone. Nevertheless General Massa brought me to her place. The next day, Nostar came and brought me back to his place.""""   From this day, B.Y. stayed with Nostar [together with A.Z. and C.X., later on joined by E.V. and D.W.]. """"When he was taking drugs, he was abusing us. He was insulting us and our family, he was beating us. When he did not smoke, he behaved nicely and protected us. He made sure that we had enough to eat. But he was nice to us only because A.Z. pleased him. A.Z. would sleep with him in a room while we would sleep in another room. He forced her. Many nights I heard A.Z. crying. She did not sleep all night.""""   She reported that they could not stay together. """"If we were together, they would come with their guns and say that we are planning bad things. We could not pray in group. We had to pray separately."""" C.X., A.Z. and she thought of escaping twice. However, they had no idea where they were. They were also afraid of the government troops. """"I cried every night. I missed my family. I worried about how they manage without me"""". She reported that the rebels hold several meetings during which they planned to kill them because they were afraid that they would reveal their secrets. """"They threatened me and my family. They warned that if I tell my story, they would kill us. They said that they have rights here in Guinea as well. They took my ID card when we were at the hospital. They said they would use it to find me.""""   """"When we arrived in Kolahun, the rebels living there said that it was their time to have us. They wanted us to stay there two weeks before going to Voinjama. Thanks to God, the car arrived the next morning.""""  C.X. (27 years old, single): She worked during the night shift and came home around 9h00. She was about to have breakfast at a friend's place when the shooting started. She ran to the hospital but came back to her house [located beside the hospital] because she had forgotten her keys. After the shooting, which lasted 20-25 minutes, she heard the rebels going through each house, searching for teenagers. The rebels entered the house and found her [together with E.V.] hiding in a corner. They forced her into an ambulance and drove to Lofa bush.   """"We spent one month in the Lofa bush. Every day was hell. After the training, they said we were weak. They decided to give us as wife to high-ranking officers. They came to decide whom to take. One came to me. He wanted to sleep with me. I refused."""" The officer, named Moton, verbally and physically assaulted C.X. on a daily basis because she refused to have sex with him. He tortured her, beat her, dragged her on the street, naked her, and threatened to kill her. """"Moton took everything from me: my passport, my gold chain, my ID card and my diary in which I kept my friends' addresses. I was forced to give information about my family and rela tives. He said he would use this to trace me and kill me.""""   C.X. reported that they received constant threats. """"They said that they would get everyone of us pregnant. They wanted us to become sex-slaves. At one point, I almost gave up. There were so insisting."""" Although she was severely beaten, C.X. continuously refused to have sex. """"As a result, General Massa hated me. She said I was stubborn. She said that I had to be deployed [word used by the rebels to say ‘married']. One day, she ordered Gonda to rape me. If I was not raped, it is only because of God's mercy."""" Gonda went into the house in which C.X. was staying. He physically assaulted her and forced her to undress. She managed to run away to general Massa's house. During the same evening, Gonda raped B.Y. [see above].   Gonda tried to sexually assault C.X. on two other occasions. Each time, she managed to escape. """"One night in Wiesua, Gonda came to look for me. He told me that Nostar was waiting for me outside and that he wanted to discuss with me. It was late so I knew it was something fishy. I told him that it could wait until tomorrow. Gonda became furious. He started to pull me out of the house and slapped me. I had to hang at the door. Nostar came in and asked Gonda to leave me alone.""""   After two weeks spent in Wiesua, the survivors started to walk towards Kolahun accompanied by Nostar and two child soldiers. When they reached a small village called Moyeso, C.X. was told that she could not follow them anymore. """"Nostar decided to leave me there. He said that I was bad because I did not want did not want to sleep with them. The other girls tried to convince him to keep me but he said that he would kill anyone who would speak. He told me that he would send ten men to get me. [Another rebel] found me and took care of me. Since the chairman had said that we should go to the headquarters, he brought me to Kolahun."""" She arrived there one day after Nostar and the four other survivors.   """"When we arrived in Voinjama, the rebels tried to polish the reputation of the organization. They said that we should forget what happened. They told us that if we go back to Monrovia, they would not spare us a second time. They would kill us. They added that we are not free in Guinea. I am afraid because my last name is of Nigerian origin. My family is perhaps the only Liberian people with such a name. The rebels can trace us very easily. I want to go to a safe place with my family. """"   """"At the border, when the rebels handed us over to UNHCR, I was interviewed by a journalist. He asked me about my experience with the rebels. I was afraid to say the truth. I told him that we were not treated badly.""""  D.W. (30 years old, married, 2 children): She was working at the maternity department when the rebels came in the hospital. """"General Death captured me at the hospital. He shot around my feet and told me that he would kill me if I tried to escape. He took my money and my bracelet. From then, he said that I was his woman.""""   When she arrived in Lofa bush, general Death took her to his place. She was forced into a relationship with him. """"He was very aggressive. He said that he was God and that he could get anything. He said that I had to sleep with him. He would kiss me and touch me. I would tell him that I am sick, that I have my periods. He forced me."""" After few days, General Death left Lofa bush and traveled to Gamba. During his absence E.V. came to live with her [see below]. One week later he came back with his wife and kicked D.W. and E.V. out of his house. """"His wife was very aggressive towards me. She tried to abuse me. I told her that it was her husband who forced me to live with him.""""   They went to Nostar to ask him to stay at his place, where C.X., B.Y. and A.Z. were already living. """"I was cooking, cleaning, and washing for him. He took care of me. He became very aggressive when he was using drugs."""" She reported that they had no rest from other men, who would come to Nostar's house and assault them.   """"At Kolahun, we learned that the headquarters had sent a vehicle to pick us up because A.Z. could not walk. Another group came and said that they wanted to keep us for a while before we could go to Voinjama."""" The car arrived the next morning and brought them directly to Voinjama. At the headquarters, the leaders tried to apologize for what had happened. """"They tried to justify the boys' behavior. They ordered us not to say anything about what happened. They told us that they have free access to Guinea. They said that they could kill us at any time.""""   """"I don't want to go back to Liberia. I am afraid for my family and myself. I don't want to stay in Guinea either.""""  E.V. (engaged, one child): She was at work when the fighting started. She ran to her house [located beside the hospital] to pick up a friend who was staying with her and her documents. Her friend had already left. She found C.X. in the house. The fighting intensified and they could not get back to the hospital. After the ceasefire, one soldier named Noa came into the house. He asked for money and belongings and ordered them to follow him. He brought them in front of the commander, who was standing beside an ambulance packed with stolen objects. The hospital administrator, chief doctor and lab technician tried to convince the rebels to release the nurses. The rebels threatened to kill them and so they left.   """"Around 9h40, we left Sinje for Lofa bush. Fighting was still ongoing, I was scared. We drove until the night and slept on the highway. We arrived in Lofa bush the following day. The first night, all of us slept at the commander's house. The next day, we were separated and given to soldiers who had fought at the hospital. I was taken by R.J. [another rebel].""""   R.J. already had a wife. She got angry and ordered E.V. to leave the house as she would otherwise be killed. E.V. answered that she did not choose to come to R.J.'s house as he is the one who decided to take her. She begged to stay one night. """"The next morning, R.J.'s wife beat me. I ran away to the house in which D.W. was staying."""" She stayed one week there [general Death's house] during the absence of general Death. """"Junior's wife was still spying on me. After a week, general Death came back with his wife. He asked D.W. and me to leave"""". They went to live at Nostar's house. """"Nostar was only about A.Z.. He left me alone. He only protected us because of A.Z. However, other men would give us a hard time. We had no rest.""""   """"The rebels refused that we stayed with the civilians. The civilians are those who carry the ammunitions, collect the wood and prepare the food. They were not harassed by the soldiers. So we were not civilians and we were not fighters. We were in between. We stayed with the fighters and were used as slaves.""""   On 20 July the rebels started to retreat to Wiesua, and the survivors continued to live with Nostar. After two weeks Nostar and two child soldiers were instructed to bring the survivors to Kolahun. """"The walk from Wiesua to Kolahun was terrible. We did not have proper shoes. We did not have enough food. One day, we had to cross a river but the canoe was not there. We spent the night by the river. It was cold, there were many mosquitoes. From that day, my skin began to hitch. Later on, A.Z.'s foot became so swollen that she could not walk. The rebels abducted some farmers and forced them to carry her on a stretcher.""""   In Voinjama, she received threats. """"They said that we should not think that we are free. They say that they know where we are and that they could kill us at any time if we tell their secrets.""""  II. Ongoing Violations Committed by Government Troops and LURD Forces  Civilians Burned Alive by Government Troops   Refugees reported to Human Rights Watch that they have witnessed government troops rounding up civilians, locking them in houses, and then setting those houses on fire-burning them alive. Human Rights Watch has reported on this practice repeatedly in the past.  E.F., a twenty-eight year old Gbandi woman from Kiatahun village in Kolahun District reported to Human Rights Watch that in June 2002, the government troops attacked her village, and put a group of (she estimated) approximately fifty civilians into a house, including E.F.'s mother and father, and burn the house down, burning to death all those inside.[1] E.G., a twenty¬eight-year-old man from Kiatahun and E.F.'s brother (interviewed separately), described the incident. He said that on June 8, government troops captured one hundred and twenty five civilians from Kiatahun and brought them forcibly to Kamatahun. On June 30, sixty-five of those people were brought back to Kiatahun, according to E.G. They were all put into a house alive, and the house was lit on fire using gasoline. """"My father and mother were inside,"""" E.G. reported, confirming E.F.'s dramatic story. """"I stood right there, not far away, and watched. I heard people screaming.""""[2] D.F., a thirty-year old man from Kolahun town, said that in early June 2002 he saw government troops put three people live into a house, lock the door, and burn it down. The incident reportedly took place in the Gbandi quarter of Kolahun town, and the victims were Korpor Bockarie, sixty years old; Sherif Bockarie, seventy-five years old; and Djongba Sherif, sixty-five years old.[3] D.F. reported that he fled from Kolahun town to Susumoilahun village, where in July 2002 he witnessed government troops put seven people into a house, lock them in, and burn them to death inside. Among the victims of this incident, according to D.F., were three women, two men, and two children. """"We heard voices of people crying,"""" he said.[4] Killings of Civilians by Government Troops   Witnesses reported that government troops under the authority of President Charles Taylor continue to engage in widespread indiscriminate killing of civilians, using both firearms and other weapons. Liberian civilians who fled Kolahun district in October 2002 reported that """"Government troops just run into villages and kill people, [they] don't care who you are...they used guns, knives, and beat people with sticks until they die...They kill innocent civilians.""""[5]  D.E., a thirty year old Gbandi woman from Gbaohun village in Kolahun District informed Human Rights Watch that in July 2002, government troops compelled her brother to carry loads for them, and then killed him.[6] I.J., a twenty five year old woman from Hasagulowain village in Kolahun District, reported to Human Rights Watch that on September 14, 2002, government troops came into her village and killed five persons before her eyes with AK-47s.  One of them, according to I.J., was a thirty-one-year-old male named Kollie, and the other four were women, all of whom were unarmed civilians.[7] I.J. also stated that in August 2002 in the same village, she saw the bodies of five others, two men and three women, whose throats had been cut and whose bodies had been burned with tires.[8] J.K. reported to Human Rights Watch that in August 2002, government troops entered Lehuma town, came into his house, and shot dead his twenty-five-year-old daughter.[9] R.S., a twenty-eight-year-old man from Masambolahun village in Kolahun District, reported that government troops entered Masambolahun in September 2002.  On that first day, R.S. said, he saw more than fifteen bodies of his neighbors, some killed by knife and some by firearms.[10] S.T., a forty-five-year-old woman from Masambolahun, reported that when government troops attacked her village in June 2002, they fled briefly into the bush, coming back when the troops had left. Upon her return, she found the bodies of her elder brother, whose body had been burned, and her younger brother, who was apparently killed by a bullet wound to the chest.  S.T. also reported that a woman named Hawa Kama was killed, and her daughter disappeared.[11] V.W., a forty-nine year old man from Kiatahun village in Kolahun District, informed Human Rights Watch that on June 8, 2002, when government troops entered Kolahun town, they killed eleven people that he knew of in the Tulay quarter of the town, among them men and women. V.W. reported that he buried the bodies of these people, and that he had known them. He said they had all been shot.[12]  V.W. further alleged that in August 2002, after government troops captured and held Kolahun town for four days, he buried five bodies of civilians killed by government troops, all shot. He reported that government troops were """"shooting all around.""""[13] B.D., a twenty-five year old man also from Kiatahun village, Kolahun district, said that when government troops captured Kiatahun in June 2002, they killed his mother, fifty-five years old, and his uncle. He also said he saw government troops kill nine other people, shooting them dead and then covering the bodies with mattresses which they then lit on fire.[14] C.E., a twenty-eight year old woman from Kolahun town, said that in June and July 2002 she saw at least twenty dead bodies of civilians killed by government troops, many of whom were shot in the back.[15] D.F., a thirty year old man from Kolahun town, reported that he too saw many civilians killed in Kolahun town during the month of June 2002 by government troops. He reported seeing over fifty bodies of people in the street, many of whom had been killed by knives.[16] D.F. told of the summary killings of ten people by government troops in Gelehun village, all with knives. He said that the men had been forced to carry loads of weapons from Susumoilahun village to Gelehun, and once there they were all killed. D.F. helped to bury the bodies.[17] According to E.G., government troops entered Kiatahun on September 5, 2002, and recaptured that village. During this time, E.G. saw the troops kill seven persons, of which he alleges that five were civilians, four of whom were women. They were shot to death before his eyes.[18] Civilians Abducted and """"Disappeared"""" by Government Troops   Witnesses reported to Human Rights Watch that government troops continue their well-documented pattern of abductions of civilians, including young girls and boys. In many cases, those abducted """"disappear,"""" with their fates entirely unknown.  C.D., a twenty-six year old Gbandi woman from Masambarahun village in Kolahun District told Human Rights Watch that during the month of September 2002, she was an eye witness to government troops abducting twenty-seven-year-old Sangay Kanneh, as well as a seven year old girl named Gpana Kamara. C.D. reported that the soldiers who captured them were wearing uniforms and were heavily armed.[19] D.E. told Human Rights Watch, """"I saw plenty of people taken away by government troops, all of them boys, young boys, from Gbaohun.""""[20] E.F. informed Human Rights Watch of the abduction of her thirty-five-year-old brother by government troops, whose head was covered with a box as he was taken away forcibly in June 2002.[21] Numerous others were reportedly abducted by government troops in July 2002 from Kiatahun village in Kolahun District-small children who have not been heard from since.[22] I.J. told Human Rights Watch that she witnessed government troops abduct ten civilians, mostly girls but some men, from Hasagulowain village in September 2002.[23] R.S. informed Human Rights Watch that two woman, one approximately fifteen years old and one twenty-five years old, were disappeared by government troops in September 2002. Their names were Hawa Korpor, disappeared from Masambolahun, and Mbuwe Djassou, disappeared from Jembelahun village, respectively.[24] V.W. told Human Rights Watch that more than eighty people were captured by government troops in Kolahun town in August 2002 and taken to Foya District. He alleged that men, women, and children were captured, including four-year-old Kama Turay.[25] D.F. informed Human Rights Watch of the abduction of twelve people from Susumoilahun by government troops in July 2002. Among those abducted he could confirm that there were four women, two of whom were abducted together with their infant babies.[26] Government Troops Firing on Fleeing Civilians  Scores of Liberian civilians who fled Kolahun district in October 2002 reported that Liberian government forces continue to systematically fire upon fleeing civilians. Many said, """"As we were fleeing, the government troops were firing on us.""""[27]  J.K. reported that when he and his neighbors were fleeing government troops who had captured Lehuma town in Kolahun District in August 2002, the government troops were firing at them as they were running away. Among those killed while being shot at were J.K.'s thirty-one- year-old brother and his brother-in-law, both of whom were shot in the back while fleeing in August 2002.[28] O.P. also informed Human Rights Watch that when she was fleeing Kolahun District in October, she was running away with many civilians, and that government troops were shooting at them from behind as they fled.[29]   [1] Human Rights Watch interview, Dauda Way Station, Kenema District, Sierra Leone, November 19, 2002.

Human Rights Watch said there are three categories of prisoners at Guantanamo who should be released:  Taliban soldiers who were detained in the now-concluded war between the United States and the government of Afghanistan, unless they are being prosecuted for war crimes; civilians who have no meaningful connection to al-Qaeda or the Taliban, and probably should never have been sent to Guantanamo in the first place; and suspected terrorists whose detention had nothing to do with the war in Afghanistan, unless they are charged with a crime and prosecuted. “There are people being held at Guantanamo who shouldn’t be there,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “The United States cannot simply hold the detainees for as long as it wants.”  The Taliban soldiers captured during the war between the United States and Afghanistan should have been repatriated by now because the war ended last year with the formation of the government of Hamid Karzai. Under the Geneva Conventions, the United States must release those soldiers unless they are being charged with war crimes or other criminal offenses.  The Geneva Conventions permit the extended detention of civilians captured in a war zone only after criminal prosecution or for “imperative reasons of security.” To invoke the security rationale, a decision must be made for each individual civilian in a regularized process that includes appeal and a review every six months. If people being held at Guantanamo had no connections to the Taliban or al-Qaeda, it is difficult to conceive how their detention could be considered “imperative” for national security.  The United States is also holding alleged al-Qaeda terrorists picked up in places other than Afghanistan. The Geneva Conventions do not apply when terrorist suspects are apprehended outside areas of armed conflict and have no direct connection to such conflict, such as those apprehended in Bosnia-Herzegovina. But the suspects are not left without any legal protection. International human rights law requires that they be formally charged, informed of their rights, and permitted access to legal counsel. International humanitarian law provides no basis for circumventing these human rights requirements by purporting to hold such persons as “enemy combatants.”","Asia, United States, Afghanistan","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Guantanamo"

Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, vice-chairman of Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) and deputy commander-in-chief of Iraq’s armed forces during Iraq's 1988 campaign of genocide against the country’s Kurdish population, is attending an emergency summit meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference in Qatar’s capital, Doha. “As Saddam Hussein's number two, Izzat Ibrahim has been involved in some of Iraq's worst crimes – including the use of poison gas against the country’s Kurds,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Qatar should take this opportunity to bring him to justice and the international community should back his prosecution.""""  In a letter to Hasan bin Abdallah al-Ghanim, Qatar’s Minister of Justice, Human Rights Watch noted that Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri has served as Deputy Chair of the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC)—effectively number two in the government—since Saddam Hussein took full power in 1979. In 1988, he was also a member of the RCC's Northern Affairs Committee that, along with the Ba'th Party's Northern Bureau Command, was the administrative backbone for the genocidal Anfal campaign against Iraq's Kurdish population. The Northern Affairs Committee placed its seal on a June 20, 1987 directive, coded SF/4008, which called for """"special strikes”—i.e., chemical attacks—“to kill the largest number of persons"""" in designated zones, as well as the capture and execution of all adults found in prohibited areas. Ibrahim was reported in the Washington Post on January 24, 1991, as warning the people of Sulaimaniyya, a major city in the Kurdish north, """"if you have forgotten Halabja, I would like to remind you that we are ready to repeat the operation."""" The Kurdish city of Halabja was the target of a major Iraqi chemical weapons assault on March 16, 1988 that killed as many as 5,000 residents.  The crimes that Izzat Ibrahim is credibly alleged to have committed, including systematic or widespread killings, “disappearances,” and torture, constitute crimes against humanity. As such, they are subject to universal jurisdiction, a principle well established in international law.

The State Department named six countries, Burma, China, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Sudan to its list of """"Countries of Particular Concern"""" under the International Religious Freedom Act. All were named in 2001, the last time the list was updated. Not named were such countries as Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, where the right to worship freely is systematically violated. """"The Bush administration says it wants to promote human rights in the Muslim world,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"But it can hardly say it's trying if it's afraid to state the simple truth about some of its partners.""""  The State Department failed to designate Saudi Arabia a Country of Particular Concern despite concluding in its most recent International Religious Freedom Report that """"religious freedom does not exist"""" there. The government forbids all demonstration of religious faith that is not consistent with the state-sanctioned interpretation of the Sunni branch of Islam. Shi'a Muslims face severe discrimination. All public non-Muslim religious activities are prohibited. The distribution of Bibles is banned. Many Christians have been imprisoned or deported for practicing their faith.  Uzbekistan was not designated even though for nearly five years its government has persecuted thousands of individuals whose peaceful practice of Islam falls beyond state controls. In a briefing paper published in August 2002, Human Rights Watch detailed the arbitrary arrest, unfair trials and torture of hundreds of independent Muslims in Uzbekistan since October 2001, the last time the administration issued its religious freedom designations. In 2002 alone, Human Rights Watch documented five deaths in custody, apparently as a result of torture, of men convicted for their religious practices or affiliations. The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom had recommended that Uzbekistan be placed on a """"watch list"""" of countries that might be designated as major violators if they do not change their practices. But today's State Department statement failed to put Uzbekistan on notice, or to urge reform there.  Also not designated was Turkmenistan, one of the most repressive countries in the world, which in 1997 outlawed all religions except Sunni Islam and Russian Orthodoxy. Among the groups most affected by the Turkmen government's draconian restrictions on religion are Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists, Adventists and Hare Krishnas. Islamic groups also suffer state harassment.

The boys, ages 14 and 16, were charged with treason in late 2002. One will next appear in court on March 6, 2003 in Moyo while the other is set to appear in Gulu on March 20. A Human Rights Watch representative met with the boys in Gulu on February 6.  """"Treason is a very serious charge and should not be used against children who have been abducted by force and compelled to commit acts of violence,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"The government should immediately drop the treason charges and ensure that these boys have access to rehabilitation assistance.""""   In a letter sent to the Minister of Justice on February 19, 2003, Human Rights Watch urged the government to immediately drop the treason charges, and release them to a rehabilitation center. The organization also called on the government to issue a public statement that children will not be subject to treason charges, and to ensure that such a statement is broadly disseminated throughout northern Uganda.   In northern Uganda, at least 20,000 children have been abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army during the course of the 16-year conflict with the government, with approximately 5,000 taken since June 2002. Human Rights Watch noted that the charge of treason in these cases appears to be arbitrarily imposed, since thousands of children with similar experiences have not been similarly charged, and have been able to receive rehabilitation assistance and to return to their communities.   Uganda acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict on May 6, 2002. The protocol prohibits the forced recruitment of children or their use in hostilities by both governmental and non-governmental armed groups. Under the protocol, the government of Uganda is obliged to provide former child soldiers with assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and their social reintegration.   """"The imposition of treason charges against former abductees runs contrary to Uganda's international legal obligations,"""" said Becker. """"It may also discourage children currently in LRA captivity from seeking escape or surrendering to the Ugandan army.""""

Human Rights Watch said property rights abuses in sub-Saharan Africa perpetuate women's inequality, doom development efforts, and undermine the fight against HIV/AIDS.   """"Women's property rights violations are not only discriminatory, they may also prove deadly,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"In Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries, women are exposed to poverty, homelessness, violence and disease - including HIV/AIDS - when their property rights are abused.""""   The 51-page report, Double Standards: Women's Property Rights Violations in Kenya, examines the devastating impact of women's property rights violations in Kenya, where the constitution condones discrimination in property matters.   Human Rights Watch found:  Women are often excluded from inheriting property, evicted from their lands and homes by in-laws, and stripped of their possessions.  Some widows are forced to engage in risky sexual practices that can expose them to AIDS in order to keep their property, such as """"wife inheritance,"""" where women are inherited by male in-laws, and ritual """"cleansing,"""" where women are forced to have sex with men of low social standing.  Divorced or separated women are frequently expelled from their homes with only their clothing.  Married women can seldom stop their husbands from selling family property.  Women who fight back are often beaten, raped or ostracized.  These violations and their impact are magnified by Kenya's high HIV/AIDS prevalence. HIV-positive women, already harmed by stigma and discrimination, are gravely threatened by property rights violations. Women's insecure property rights also hinder development by contributing to low agricultural production, food shortages, underemployment, and rural poverty.  Human Rights Watch said that with a new government in office, movement toward a new constitution, and an upsurge in donor support, now is a pivotal time to improve women's property rights.   """"For decades, the Kenyan government has ignored the crisis of women's unequal property rights,"""" said Jefferson. """"Kenya and donor agencies now have a historic opportunity to make property rights a reality for women.""""   The Kenyan government has said it will hold debates on a new constitution in the first half of 2003. The proposed draft constitution, if implemented, would drastically improve women's property rights, including guarantees of equal rights to inherit and control property and prohibitions on customs and traditions that undermine women's dignity or status.   Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan government to institute legal reforms, implement programs to prevent and redress property rights abuses, and punish those who violate women's property rights. Human Rights Watch also said the World Bank and other donors should use aid to eliminate women's property rights violations.   Voices of Kenyan Women Featured in """"Double Standards""""(Pseudonyms are used for the women mentioned below to protect privacy)   Emily Owino, a fifty-four-year-old widow from western Kenya, said that shortly after her husband died, her in-laws grabbed her farm equipment, livestock, household goods, and clothing. The in-laws insisted that she be """"cleansed"""" by having sex with a social outcast, a custom in that region, as a condition of staying in her home. They paid a herdsman to have sex with Owino, against her will and without a condom. Her in-laws later took over her farmland. She sought help from the local elder and chief, who did nothing. Her in-laws forced her out of her home, and she and her children became homeless. No longer able to afford school fees, her children dropped out of school.   A mother of eight children, Mary Abudo's violent husband separated from her and kept all of their property in Kisumu, including vehicles, land, and furniture. She got nothing. Abudo went to live with her mother, but her relatives forced her out when her mother died because they thought a daughter should not inherit. """"I became homeless,"""" she said. """"My relatives set upon me and beat me viciously. I was afraid I'd die.""""   When Susan Wagitangu's parents died, her brothers inherited the family land.

Saddam Hussein used to do his worst when official Washington was on vacation — his offensive into Iraqi Kurdistan during the final days of August 1996, for example. North Korea may have provoked a crisis now because it sensed the Bush administration was distracted by Iraq. And how better to explain Russia's recent decision to end the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Chechnya? And how better to explain Russia's recent decision to end the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to Chechnya? The OSCE mission was the world's eyes and ears on the ground in Chechnya — its only real mechanism for monitoring the war and promoting dialogue. Getting the OSCE monitors in was also the Bush administration's single concrete achievement on Chechnya, an agreement it extracted from Russian President Vladimir Putin before his first summit with President Bush in 2001. Now Putin has taken that one and only concession back, becoming just the third European leader — after Slobodan Milosevic and Belarus's dictator, Alexander Lukashenko — to try to kick an OSCE mission out of his country. It's easy to guess what the opportunistic Russian leader is thinking: Surely the Americans are too preoccupied with Iraq — and with trying not to seem so preoccupied with Iraq that they can't also focus on Korea — to make an issue of anything else now. And sure enough, the administration's response has been as low-key as they come. U.S. diplomats quietly tried to change Russia's mind, then took no for an answer and moved on. Instead of winning concessions, the administration is granting them: Yesterday the State Department announced it would place three Chechen groups on its list of terrorist organizations — a decision that may be objectively justified but that Russia will see as a quid for its support on Iraq. The message this sends — that the United States can focus only on one crisis now — won't be lost on Russia or other countries. When war in Iraq begins, look for Russia to push the envelope even further — perhaps by shutting down the remaining camps that shelter displaced Chechens and pushing them back to the war zone. If Putin thinks the United States won't notice, he's probably right. Why should we notice? It's not simply that the torture and disappearances committed by Russian forces in Chechnya bear such a sad resemblance to the atrocities that trouble President Bush when committed in Baghdad or Pyongyang. It is also because Russia has cast these cruelties as its contribution to America's fight against global terrorism. And it is because Russia's actions fan the flames they are meant to extinguish. They punish Chechens whether or not they participate in terrorism, offering no incentive to reject terror. They are forging a generation of young people who know only violence, making them easy recruits for those who preach only violence. One reason little is said is that Chechnya breeds a sense of futility among American officials. They want to do more than react to bad news; they want to solve the problem, to find a comprehensive settlement. But this conflict appears to defy solution. Both sides kill civilians. Both seem locked in a mutual suicide pact of irrational behavior. So diplomats grow weary, then disgusted, then uninterested. In the meantime, with a few exceptions (including the current U.S. ambassador to Moscow, Alexander Vershbow), American officials resist publicly criticizing the Russian abuses they despair of ending. Speaking out may """"make us feel good,"""" they say, but it does Chechen civilians no good. Russia, they argue, will carry on no matter what Americans say. So why antagonize a vital partner? Why provoke Putin into the fits of anger he routinely, deliberately and shrewdly throws when outsiders dare to confront him about Chechnya? But if the Russian government truly doesn't care about what the United States thinks and says, why does it schedule its most provocative actions when America's attention is turned elsewhere? Why is it so intent on expelling the few outsiders who can tell Americans what is happening in Chechnya? Why does it go to such lengths to frame its actions with the language and imagery of America's struggle with terrorism? Of course American reactions matter to Russia. When Putin tried recently to use Bush's statements on preemption to justify an attack on Georgia, he backed off after the United States made clear its opposition. The war in Chechnya may not end soon. But the mere fact that the United States and the world are paying attention to what both sides are doing, with energetic monitors on the ground and strong public statements from the top, can still minimize the war's harm. The Bush administration must show that it is neither too defeatist nor too distracted to try.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Russia","International Justice"

One of the more notorious groups is the O'odua People's Congress (OPC), an organization active in the southwest, which has killed or injured hundreds of people over the last few years.   The 58-page report, """"The O'odua People's Congress: Fighting Violence with Violence,"""" provides detailed accounts of killings and other abuses by the OPC since the government of President Olusegun Obasanjo came to power in 1999. An organization that promotes self determination for the Yoruba ethnic group, the OPC is also part ethnic militia and part vigilante group. It has cashed in on a growing sense of disenfranchisement among the population and has taken advantage of the inability of the police force to maintain law and order.   """"Vigilante violence in many parts of Nigeria is an increasing problem,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. """"The OPC is a particularly dangerous example of the phenomenon.""""   Some of these killings occurred in the context of ethnic conflicts, for example in the Idi-Araba area of Lagos in February 2002 when OPC members and other Yoruba clashed with members of the Hausa ethnic group and more than seventy people were killed. In one of the most serious incidents, in October 2000, more than 250 people were killed in Ajegunle (also in Lagos) as Yoruba and Hausa fought for several days; testimonies gathered by Human Rights Watch confirmed that the OPC had played a central role in the violence in Ajegunle. In other cases, OPC members publicly killed and mutilated alleged criminals in the course of their vigilante work. They have also attacked and killed policemen.   However, OPC members have been victims as well as perpetrators of human rights abuses. The report describes the brutal response of the police, which has resulted in the extrajudicial execution, arbitrary arrest, torture and prolonged pre-trial detention of hundreds of suspected OPC members. Police have frequently raided OPC meetings including in situations where there was no evidence that those present were engaged in criminal activity. Yet there have been few successful prosecutions of OPC members or their leaders responsible for the violence.   """"Fighting violence with violence will not solve the problem,"""" said Takirambudde. """"On the contrary, it appears to have strengthened the resolve of the OPC to fight.""""   The report highlights the role of some state governments in supporting the OPC and in failing to publicly condemn the organization's use of violence. Some state governors have turned a blind eye to the OPC's acts of violence and attempted to justify using the group to fight crime on the basis that the police have been unable to do so. But whatever the weaknesses of the police force, government authorities have a responsibility to prevent the population from resorting to self-appointed vigilante groups that are known to engage in violence, Human Rights Watch said.   In 1999, President Obasanjo declared a ban on the OPC, which remains in force to this day, despite the absence of any legislation. Nevertheless, OPC members have openly provided security arrangements at public gatherings, including official events, such as the ceremony for the lying-in-state of former Minister of Justice and Attorney General Bola Ige, in January 2002, which was attended by many government officials, including President Obasanjo.   In recent months, there have been fewer reports of OPC violence, but the organization remains active and visible, and its leaders have not accepted responsibility for the serious abuses committed by their members.   """"As pre-election violence is increasing across Nigeria, the OPC with its large mass membership represents a powerful force, which could be unleashed with disastrous consequences,"""" said Takirambudde.   The report makes recommendations to the Nigerian government, including identifying and bringing to justice OPC members responsible for acts of violence, according to due process; issuing clear instructions to the police to respect the right to life and to refrain from excessive use of force; and reforming the police to ensure that it maintains law and order effectively, without carrying out systematic human rights violations.   Human Rights Watch also appealed to the leaders of the OPC to make clear to their members that acts of criminal violence will not be tolerated, and that abuses by the police, however serious, are never a justification for responding in kind. Because the OPC has a clear structure and chain of command, its leaders should be held responsible for the actions of their members, and OPC leaders should refrain from making any statements that could encourage violence.   """"If the organization is claiming to fight crime, it should cooperate with the police and hand over any suspected criminal,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Under no circumstances should vigilante groups dispense their own form of justice.""""","Africa, Nigeria",""

Although the Indian government initially boasted of thousands of arrests following the attacks, most of those arrested have since been released on bail, acquitted or simply let go. According to local activists, those who remain in jail largely belong to Dalit (so-called untouchable), Muslim or tribal communities. Due to manipulations in the filing of charge sheets, the instigators and ringleaders of the attacks may escape prosecution altogether.  """"At this point, the central authorities must step in,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher for South Asia and author of the Human Rights Watch report on the Gujarat violence. """"The same state government complicit in the violence cannot be trusted to deliver justice.""""  Human Rights Watch said that in large-scale massacre cases, the Central Bureau of Investigation, a federal body, should intervene.  Witnesses who initially came forward to file complaints and identify their attackers have since been harassed, threatened or bribed into turning hostile on the witness stand or simply not showing up when a case goes to trial. Instead of pursuing murder and rape charges, authorities have regularly downgraded charges to rioting.  Last week, the Gujarat state government charged 131 Muslims for the Godhra attack against Hindus that sparked the anti-Muslim violence. All were charged under the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA). But no Hindus have been charged under POTA in connection with the post-Godhra violence against Muslims.  """"The POTA charges show the extent of the bias in the legal system in Gujarat. The rule of law cannot be draconian for some and nonexistent for others,"""" added Narula.  Recommendations of the National Human Rights Commission and numerous human rights bodies have not been implemented and, as with previous episodes of large-scale communal violence, the government has provided little in the way of promised relief and rehabilitation.  """"India cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of its past. Impunity sows the seeds of further violence and undermines the rule of law for all citizens,"""" Narula said. """"Had the recommendations of the Srikrishna Commission inquiry into the Bombay riots in 1992 and 1993 been implemented, we might have been able to avoid last year's carnage in Gujarat.""""  Incidents of communal violence continue to be reported almost on a daily basis in Gujarat. Despite assertions to the contrary by the state government, the situation is far from """"normal."""" While many families have received monetary compensation for the deaths of their loved ones, few have received funds to adequately compensate for the destruction of their homes and businesses. The onus of providing relief has fallen largely on the Muslim community and non-governmental groups. By the end of October 2002, the government had closed most relief camps even though most families were afraid to return to what was left of their homes.  The violence in Gujarat has proved an efficient catalyst for the ghettoization of the Muslim community. The reconstruction of homes has largely taken place along communal lines. Because of fears for their safety, Muslim families have been unwilling to return to their homes. After the violence, most cannot work, reside or send their children to schools in Hindu-dominated neighborhoods. As the segregation of communities continues, hopes for dialogue and reconciliation are dissipating.  In April 2002, Human Rights Watch released its report, """"We Have No Orders to Save You: State Complicity and Participation in Communal Violence in Gujarat,"""" based on investigations conducted in March 2002. The investigations revealed that the violence against Muslims was planned well in advance of the Godhra massacre and with extensive state participation and support.  In January 2003, Human Rights Watch returned to Gujarat and spoke to eyewitnesses to some of the worst massacres, as well as numerous lawyers, activists and officials involved in the preparation of criminal cases. Human Rights Watch also interviewed eyewitnesses to the September 2002 attack on Akshardham in Gandhinagar. Human Rights Watch called on the government to prosecute those responsible for the deadly attack in which thirty-two people were killed.","Asia, India",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/27/restore-indias-secular-political-culture","Restore Indias Secular Political Culture","Restore India's Secular Political Culture","","02/27/2003","As the world deliberates a U.S.-led war in Iraq and braces for more terrorist attacks, the international community has turned a blind eye to the killing of thousands of Muslims in India in the name of fighting terrorism. A year ago today, a Muslim mob set fire to a train carrying Hindu activists in Godhra in the western state of Gujarat. Fifty-eight people were killed. In the days that followed, Hindus killed more than 2,000 Muslims throughout the state. Muslims were branded as terrorists while armed gangs set out to systematically destroy Muslim homes, businesses and places of worship. Scores of Muslim women and girls were gang-raped before being mutilated and burnt to death. Collectively, Hindu nationalist groups are known as the sangh parivar. They exert considerable influence over India's social, educational and defense policies, including the country's decision to test nuclear weapons in 1998. Investigations by Human Rights Watch and numerous Indian human-rights groups revealed that attacks on Muslims were planned well in advance of the Godhra massacre. Mobs in Ahmedabad, for example, were guided by computer printouts listing the addresses of Muslim families and their properties, information they had been collecting over several months. The attacks and other activities benefited the Bharatiya Janata Party by consolidating the Hindu vote-bank and ultimately securing victory. In December last year, the BJP won by a landslide in state elections in Gujarat. Using posters and videotapes of the Godhra massacre, and rhetoric that depicted Muslims as terrorists intent on destroying the Hindu community, the party gained the most seats in areas affected by communal violence. The Hindus killed in Godhra were returning from Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh, the site of a campaign led by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, also known as the World Hindu Council, to construct a temple dedicated to Lord Ram on the site of a mosque destroyed by Hindu militants in 1992. Riots in Bombay in 1992 and 1993 following the destruction of the mosque claimed hundreds of lives, mostly Muslim. The BJP recently determined that the construction of the Ram temple, and the fight against terrorism, would form a core part of its electoral platform. Soon after their Gujarat win, BJP and VHP officials declared that the strategy used in Gujarat would be repeated all over India, raising concerns of further violence. In states that go to the polls this year, such as Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, campaigns are already in full swing. As in Gujarat, members of the VHP are busy distributing literature in Rajasthan depicting Muslims as sexual deviants and terrorists. Members of both communities live in fear that a simple altercation could become the pretext for large-scale violence. In Madhya Pradesh, members of the Hindu Jagran Manch, a sangh parivar member, staged violent protests last week demanding unfettered access to an 11th century monument they claim is a temple and that Muslims have been using as a mosque. Two people were killed in the rioting that ensued. The international community must put pressure on the Indian government to stop supporting communally divisive policies and end ongoing impunity for campaigns of orchestrated violence. One year since the beginning of the violence in Gujarat, there have been no convictions of those responsible. The machinery of justice in Gujarat has effectively been stacked against Muslims. Eyewitnesses have bartered their security and the security of their loved ones in exchange for turning """"hostile"""" as prosecution witnesses, or simply not showing up when a case goes to trial. Ongoing impunity also sows seeds for further violence. On Sept. 24 last year, two gunmen attacked a Hindu temple in Gandhinagar in Gujarat, killing 32 people. Handwritten notes found in the gunmen's pockets identified the attackers as members of a """"movement for revenge,"""" presumably for the violence against Muslims in the state. The violence in Gujarat displaced more than 100,000 people. For months they resided in makeshift relief camps, afraid to return to what was left of their homes in Hindu-dominated neighborhoods. But between July and October, the government forcibly closed the camps. The onus of providing much needed relief and reconstruction has fallen largely on the Muslim community. Unlike the response to the devastating January 2001 earthquake in the state, funds from affluent Indians abroad have not been forthcoming. However, overseas Indians are funding VHP and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteer Corps) organizations abroad that represent themselves as cultural, educational or humanitarian groups. Unbeknown to charitable Indians who have donated millions, some of their money may be redirected for violent and sectarian purposes. Concerned about allegations linking charitable groups to violence, the U.K. Charities Commission is now investigating two RSS affiliates and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. Indians living abroad must also demand accountability from these organizations. In so doing, they would be supporting the protests of many within India against the ongoing assault on India's proud tradition as a secular democracy, and against divisive political and economic power games fought in the name of promoting a Hindu state. For now, Gujarat does not represent India. However, if the activities of some groups remain unchecked, violence could spread to other parts of the country and threaten the security of the subcontinent as a whole.

""""Our research shows the government has not produced a shred of information, even when families can furnish details about the security forces they saw abduct their sons and husbands.""""  The report, """"Time for Reckoning: Enforced Disappearances in Algeria,"""" also accuses armed groups that call themselves Islamist of kidnapping perhaps thousands of Algerians during the armed strife that ravaged the country since the early 1990s and cost over 100,000 lives. These armed groups, as well as state security services that carried out massive """"disappearances,"""" are guilty of crimes against humanity and should benefit neither from any amnesty or statute of limitations.  At a time when Algerian authorities are seeking warmer relations with the United States and European Union, there are indications they want to """"turn the page"""" on this problem. Notably, the new human rights commissioner, appointed by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, has spoken about a possible official apology and compensation to the families, but also amnesty for perpetrators.  """"The page will not be turned until the families learn the truth about what happened to their relatives, and the perpetrators are held accountable,"""" said Megally. """"Any solution that lacks truth and justice only plants the seeds for a revival of such atrocities."""" While there have been few new cases of state-sponsored """"disappearances"""" since 2000, no safeguards have been put into place to prevent their recurrence, Human Rights Watch said. Security forces, especially the feared Military Security agency, routinely deny detainees access to lawyers and do not inform families promptly about detainees' whereabouts and legal status.  Human Rights Watch urged Algerian authorities to establish an independent commission on """"disappearances"""" that is empowered to compel both the testimony of state agents and the disclosure of documents.  """"The Algerian people have paid an unspeakable toll in terms of massacres, political assassinations, torture and 'disappearances,'"""" Megally said. """"A more secure future depends on ending impunity for perpetrators on all sides.""""  Human Rights Watch also urged the government to establish procedures to preserve evidence at Algeria's many unmarked gravesites suspected of containing victims of political violence. Families of """"disappeared"""" persons should be informed about the procedures for exhuming and identifying human remains.  In the letter to President Chirac, Human Rights Watch praised France's leadership in developing international standards to prevent """"disappearances."""" However, Human Rights Watch regretted that France's past diplomacy with Algeria regarding """"disappearances"""" had yielded no tangible results. The French president should now urge President Bouteflika to take specific steps, such as those noted above, to """"help Algerian authorities honor their professed commitment to address the issue in a serious fashion,"""" the letter stated.","Middle East/North Africa, Algeria",""

The international community should call on Jakarta to extradite all indicted Indonesian officials for trial in Dili. In a bold step forward, the East Timor Serious Crimes Unit filed an indictment on February 24, charging the East Timor 8--four Indonesian generals, three colonels, and the former governor of East Timor-with crimes against humanity. The charges include murder, arson, destruction of property and forced relocation. The indictment covers crimes committed before and after East Timor's referendum on independence in August 1999. The accused include former Indonesian Minister of Defense and Armed Forces Commander General Wiranto.  All of the suspects are believed to be in Indonesia. """"This is the first genuine attempt to hold senior officials accountable for the organized violence in 1999,"""" said Brad Adams, executive director of the Asia Division at Human Rights Watch. """"The big test now will be whether Indonesia is prepared to arrest those indictees in Indonesia and send them to Dili for trial.  This will require a fundamental change in Indonesia's attitude towards justice for East Timor."""" Just how difficult this will be was demonstrated by the reaction of Indonesia's current Foreign Affairs Minister, Hasan Wirajuda, who said the government would """"simply ignore"""" the indictments. In September 1999, the Indonesian military and pro-Jakarta Timorese militias went on a campaign of murder, arson and forced expulsion after the people of East Timor voted for independence in a United Nations administered referendum.  An estimated 1,000 to 2,000 East Timorese civilians lost their lives in the months before, and days immediately after, the voting. Approximately 500,000 people were forced from their homes or fled to seek refuge. Indonesia's own efforts to bring high-ranking perpetrators to justice in a parallel ad hoc judicial process in Jakarta have been a failure. Thus far, Indonesia has failed to cooperate with the Serious Crimes Unit, making the work of the Unit much more difficult. """"Indonesia has failed to investigate, much less prosecute and convict, the people who organized and planned the attacks in 1999,"""" said Adams. """"The Attorney General's office even ignored the recommendations of its own national human rights commission that General Wiranto should be put on trial."""" Human Rights Watch said this failure has placed the burden for a genuine accounting on the Serious Crimes Unit. """"The Serious Crimes Unit should be commended for doing what it was created to do: follow the evidence and indict the people alleged to be most responsible for the East Timor atrocities,"""" said Adams. Human Rights Watch renewed its call for the U.N. Secretary-General to commission a report by a group of experts to examine all options for justice for East Timor, including examining the Jakarta trial process, looking at mechanisms for extradition and trials of key suspects, and considering ways to strengthen the Serious Crimes Unit's capacity to continue its investigations and prosecutions. With the Jakarta process due to finish next month, the burden of accountability will be left with the unit and East Timor unless the United Nations acts to establish another mechanism.  """"More than ever, continued U.N. involvement and donor support for the process in Dili will be crucial,"""" said Adams. """"The East Timorese government has neither the resources nor the political clout to successfully prosecute senior Indonesian generals by itself. The international community must push Jakarta to fully cooperate with the United Nations."""" Human Rights Watch stressed the obligations of the United Nations and its member states to stay engaged with the Dili process. The unit must be allowed to fully complete the task given by Security Council Resolution 1272, which demanded that those responsible for the 1999 violence be brought to justice.","Asia, Timor-Leste, Indonesia","International Justice"

The arrest was the latest in a series of police actions intended to chill public criticism of the government.  Police arrested Ergash Bobojanov, a member of the opposition movement “Birlik” (Unity), at his home in the Fergana Valley on February 17, 2003, in what appears to be a renewed crackdown against those who publicly criticize the government. According to human rights advocates in the Fergana Valley, eyewitnesses saw police beat Bobojanov during his arrest. Police took Bobojanov to the Fergana Pre-Trial Detention Center Number 10 and charged him with criminal defamation.  Human Rights Watch is very concerned for Bobojanov’s health. Bobojanov, who is in his sixties, was reported a week after his arrest to be in very poor health, suffering from constant convulsions and having difficulty speaking. He is believed to be a diabetic with heart problems.  “The Bobojanov arrest shows the Uzbek authorities’ intolerance of criticism,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “And now this intolerance is endangering a man’s life.”  The charges against Bobojonov—criminal defamation (article 139 of the Criminal Code), revealing state secrets (article 125), and making death threats (article 112)—relate to two articles he wrote for Res Publica, a newspaper published in Kyrgyzstan, in 1999 and 2001. The articles, entitled “Bureaucracy of public servants is a danger to the government,” and “They demand that you pray for Islam Karimov,” were critical of the Uzbek government and raised issues of local government corruption.  In May 2002, Uzbek authorities announced the end of pre-publication censorship. The government, however, continues to use other means of control to restrict the media, which engage in heavy self-censorship to avoid criticism of government policies.  “When pre-publication censorship ended, some people thought this would lead to more diversity in the media,” said Andersen. “But Bobojonov’s arrest is among the latest in a series of events showing the authorities’ hardening attitude toward criticism.”  On February 22, police in Tashkent detained Oleg Sarapulov, an assistant to an independent journalist who publishes his material on the Internet. They held him for two days without access to a lawyer or family and friends. Sarapulov told Human Rights Watch that police questioned him about two articles critical of the Uzbek government in his possession and accused him of distributing these to others. The articles, by U. Khaknazarov and found on CentrAsia website, have become well-known in Tashkent since January for their critical commentary on the inner workings of the Uzbek government, including inter-clan rivalries and corruption. The site is blocked on most Internet providers in Uzbekistan.  According to Sarapulov, police planted on him leaflets of Hizb ut-Tahrir, an Islamic organization that calls for the establishment of a Caliphate (an Islamic state) in traditionally Muslim lands and whose activities are illegal in Uzbekistan. He told Human Rights Watch that an ongoing investigation could lead to criminal charges that he is involved in anti-constitutional activities.  On February 18, a court sentenced Ghairat Mekhliboev, a journalist, to seven years in prison for membership in Hizb ut-Tahrir. Mekhliboev had published articles in several Uzbek newspapers, including the mainstream weekly Khurriat. The court convicted him on charges of anti-constitutional activities (article 159), involvement in religious “extremist” organizations (articles 216 and 244-2), and inciting religious hatred (article 156). The verdict focused on his journalism, including an article published in Khurriat that allegedly contained Hizb ut-Tahrir’s ideas. The article was published in April 2001, when Uzbek newspapers were still under pre-publication censorship and highly unlikely to publish any materials contrary to government policy against unofficial Islam. Mekhliboev admitted in court that he had studied the ideas of Hizb ut-Tahrir, but denied that he was in possession of their materials. He also stated that law enforcement authorities beat him in custody.  “Prosecuting Mekhliboev may have been a way for the government to send a signal to today’s journalists not to overstep any boundaries,” said Andersen.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/24/egypts-emergency-without-end","Egypts Emergency without End","Egypt's Emergency without End","Rushed Renewal of Repressive Legislation","02/24/2003","The Egyptian government's abrupt renewal of the country's repressive Emergency Law on February 23 is designed to quash the growing campaign for the abolition of the law, Human Rights Watch said today.  The government introduced the bill to extend the law in the People's Assembly (Maglis al Sha'b) without prior notice and rushed it to passage the same day. The ruling National Democratic Party dominates the 454-seat People's Assembly.  """"The Egyptian authorities demonstrated their fear of public scrutiny by the speed and stealth with which they renewed this deeply unpopular law,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"This approach shows real contempt for the government's democratic processes.""""  Egypt has been governed under Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 almost continuously since 1967. The law gives the authorities extensive powers to suspend basic liberties including:  arresting suspects at will and detaining them without trial for prolonged periods; referring civilians to military or exceptional state security courts whose procedures fall far short of international standards for fair trial; prohibiting strikes, demonstrations and public meetings, and censoring or closing down newspapers in the name of national security.  The law, which must be renewed every three years, had been due to expire in May 2003. Widespread reports that the government would attempt to move up the date for renewal had prompted civil society groups, including human rights organizations, to organize a campaign against the law's renewal.  Thousands of dissidents, particularly members of Islamist organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood, have been detained under the Emergency Law in recent years. Some have been held for years under continuously renewed administrative detention orders, without charge, trial or legal recourse. Torture by State Security Intelligence (SSI) forces during detention is widespread. In recent weeks, opponents of a possible war in Iraq have also been detained under the Emergency Law. One of them, Kamal Khalil, founder of the Center for Socialist Studies in Cairo and an antiwar activist, went missing on February 18. State Security officers have privately told family members that he is in detention, but his whereabouts are unknown. He suffers from asthma and is recovering from recent major surgery; family members have been unable to deliver him urgently needed medicines.  Defending the law during the very brief People's Assembly debate, government officials cited the war on terrorism as one of the main justifications for renewal. Kamal El-Shazly, Minister of State for People's Assembly and Consultative Council Affairs, reportedly cited as a model the anti-terrorist legislation in the United States, which he noted had greatly expanded police powers since September 11, 2001.  Only 30 members of the 454-member Assembly, all from opposition parties, voted against renewing the enabling law. They noted that Egypt has experienced no significant terrorist attacks for more than three years.  """"This vote exemplifies the opportunism of governments exploiting the threat of terrorism to restrict their own people's rights and freedoms,"""" said Megally. """"The real emergency in Egypt is the government's renewal of the Emergency Law for another three years.""""","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

But I'm never fully calm now whether I'm at home or not or when somebody is out of the house because I know what can happen. I don't trust anybody anymore in Moscow: neither the soldiers nor the police—nobody."""" Makka Shidaeva to Human Rights Watch.1 """"Your wanting to register in Moscow is the same as going to the White House and asking to live there."""" Registration official to a Chechen woman.2 Introduction Chechens in Moscow have long been the target of police abuse. But the mass hostage taking at a Moscow theater by Chechen rebel fighters in October 2002 triggered an intense police crackdown and widespread discrimination against ethnic Chechens living in Moscow. Although Russia's President Vladimir Putin to his credit warned against an anti-Chechen sentiment during the hostage crisis, Moscow's police nonetheless stepped up identity checks and arbitrarily detained hundreds of Chechens, fingerprinting and photographing them. Police officers planted drugs and ammunition on Chechens, and then solicited bribes from them in exchange for not pressing charges. Police officials at registration offices routinely refused to register Chechens for obligatory resident permits, frequently referring to """"instructions from above."""" Police also exerted pressure on Moscow landlords to evict Chechen tenants. Chechen parents of school-aged children frequently complained that Moscow schools threatened to close their doors to Chechen children who lacked residence permits, although most children were able to continue to attend classes. The fallout from the hostage crisis came in the context of a longstanding but unaddressed problem of police harassment of ethnic minorities and migrants in Moscow. For more than a decade, Human Rights Watch and other nongovernmental organizations have documented the police's discriminatory and predatory enforcement of Moscow's civilian registration system, including extortion of bribes, beatings, invasion of privacy, and destruction of identity documents.3 Although evidence of such abuses has repeatedly been brought to the attention of the Russian government, and in particular to Moscow's mayor Yuri Luzhkov, the authorities have persistently failed to take effective steps to stop them. At times of security emergencies, Moscow police routinely intensify this abuse. Although this trend started with the political crisis in 1993, it was most acute in the aftermath of the 1999 bombings of several apartment buildings in Moscow and Volgodonsk, which the Russian government blamed on Chechen terrorists. In the wake of those attacks, police dragged more than twenty thousand Chechens to police stations, photographing and fingerprinting many of them. They also planted drugs and ammunition in the clothes or apartments of dozens of Chechens, and prosecuted them on groundless charges.4 This briefing paper is based on interviews with eleven ethnic Chechens who suffered human rights abuses in the wake of the hostage taking and several lawyers who represent them; staff members of Civic Assistance, a leading Russian nongovernmental organization that works on refugee and displacement issues5; and staff at the office of Aslambek Aslakhanov, a member of Russia's State Duma who has received hundreds of complaints from Chechens about abuses in Moscow since late October 2002. Human Rights Watch also examined publications in Russian and international press on this topic.6 This paper aims to contribute to the upcoming review by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (""""the Committee"""") of the Russian government's (""""the government"""") compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (""""the Convention""""), in March 2003. It does not purport to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the government's implementation of the Convention. We recognize the existence of other significant violations of the Convention taking place in Russia that are beyond the scope of this paper. The cases presented in this paper indicate a pattern of racially motivated discrimination and harassment against ethnic Chechens in Moscow that violates Convention obligations contained in Articles 5, 6, and 7. Accordingly, Human Rights Watch encourages the Committee to take account of this pattern in its consideration of Russia, and submits that the government should be called upon to undertake immediate measures to end it. In particular, the government should:  Investigate promptly and impartially incidents of racially motivated discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chechens and other vulnerable groups, and duly discipline and, where appropriate, prosecute state officials and agents implicated in such acts. The state must also enforce and strengthen existing laws prohibiting such discrimination by private persons; Adopt effective measures to prevent and punish manifestations of racial bias in the criminal justice system, including through independent oversight mechanisms to ensure equal treatment and adequate application of the law, but also through training of law enforcement officials and the judiciary about the binding nature of international and domestic prohibitions of discrimination; Conduct studies of access for Chechens and other minorities to education, housing, employment, health-care and social services, and establish effective mechanisms for addressing discrimination in these fields; At the highest levels, the government should speak out against racial discrimination and harassment of ethnic Chechens and others, and make clear that such acts have no place in Russian society.  Arbitrary Identity Checks and Detention Moscow police have stepped up their routine identity checks of civilians at metro stations and on the streets, frequently stopping individuals with dark skin, as well as visiting the private apartments where Chechens live. When they find fault with identity documents or registration papers, police routinely take their holders to the police precinct, where they are often searched, photographed, questioned, fingerprinted, and shaken down for money. Some evidence suggests that this increased police activity is the result of explicit, but unwritten, orders from higher-ranking police officials . For example, a police official at one Moscow registration office told a Civic Assistance activist that he and his colleagues are under informal orders to regularly visit apartments where Chechens are known to live. He had received the order from his direct supervisor and did not know where it originated. Human Rights Watch documented the following example:  On October 30, a group of fifteen police officers detained Aelita Shidaeva at the cafe where she worked. The police officers, regular clients at the cafe, already knew Shidaeva and came looking for her specifically. The officers put all staff and customers against the wall and took Shidaeva to the Marinski Park precinct. Shidaeva's mother told Human Rights Watch that, for the next seven hours, police officers questioned and intimidated her, trying to force her to admit to having been in contact with the hostage takers. The officers also unsuccessfully tried to tear her temporary registration papers, which she had apparently laminated, and told her they """"didn't need any Chechens here."""" Shidaeva's co-workers called her mother, who then went to the police station to ask about her daughter. The police officers denied holding Shidaeva and threatened to lock her up if she did not leave immediately. The mother left and alerted several journalists and human rights workers, who then called the police precinct. Shidaeva was released that same evening. Later, she told her mother that she had seen police officers dragging a middle-aged Chechen man through a corridor at the police precinct. The man had been seriously beaten, could not stand on his feet, and had cried out: """"Let me go, what have I done to you, don't beat me.""""7  Planting of drugs or weapons Russian human rights groups have received increasing numbers of complaints of police planting drugs and weapons since the hostage taking. An aide to State Duma deputy Aslambek Aslakhanov told Human Rights Watch that as of February 9, 2003, his office was pursuing fifty-six written complaints but that they have received more than three hundred from Chechens since late October 2002.8 Civic Assistance has documented nine new cases of planting of evidence.9 The planting by police of drugs and weapons on Chechens first became widespread in the aftermath of the September 1999 apartment bombings. Over the next four months, Civic Assistance and Memorial Human Rights Center documented over fifty such incidents. Although the practice subsided significantly in 2000, it never completely ended and human rights groups continued to receive occasional complaints about new incidents in 2001 and 2002. The Russian authorities have done little to address the issue. Prosecutors routinely press charges against the victims of the practice despite overwhelming evidence that they were groundless, and, as a rule, Moscow courts convict them. For example, most of the fifty cases Civic Assistance and Memorial documented in 1999 and early 2000 ended in conviction. Many other cases never make it to the courts as relatives of the detainees bribed law enforcement officials to avoid charges.10 According to Aslakhanov's office, as of this writing, only one Moscow police officer had been convicted for planting evidence on a Chechen.11 Human Rights Watch has documented several such cases since the October hostage taking:  On October 27, at about 3:00 p.m., three police officers came to the Gadaev family's apartment and checked the papers of those present. According to a relative, when the officers discovered that twenty-six-year-old Islam Gadaev's temporary registration had expired, they took him to police precinct No. 162. Gadaev spent the next seven hours in a police cell before his interrogation. In the interrogation room, Gadaev was surrounded by three or four policemen and felt someone slipping something into his pocket. When he tried to check what it was, the officers put his arms behind his back and put him to the floor. They then pulled a package he had not seen before out of his pocket. Police investigators later determined that the package contained 0.1 grams of heroin and charged Gadaev with possession of drugs. Gadaev is currently awaiting trial and continues to assert his innocence.12 Police detained """"Ali Bashirov"""" (not his real name) twice in the weeks after the hostage taking. On October 26, police took Bashirov from his bed and brought him to the police precinct No. 77, where they fingerprinted and photographed him. A procuracy official, a friend of Bashirov's, released him seven hours later but warned him that police would arrest him again and plant evidence on him if he did not leave the area. Indeed, police detained Bashirov again on November 7. A neighbor who witnessed the detention and followed the police officers to the precinct told Human Rights Watch that plainclothes police officers grabbed Bashirov as he pulled into a courtyard to have lunch at his sister's house, and drove him to the police precinct.13 Bashirov later told his sister that, at the precinct, the officers """"found"""" 0.06 grams of heroin on him. He did not specify when the drugs were planted. In the indictment, the police asserted that Bashirov was on foot and walked unsteadily and that officers took him to a nearby hotel where they searched him and found the drugs.14 In his interview with Human Rights Watch, the neighbor disputed the police's version of events, saying that Bashirov had been driving a car and did not appear intoxicated.15 Police officers initially promised Bashirov they would not press charges if he paid them a U.S.$3,000 bribe, which he could not afford. The procuracy official, who released Bashirov the first time, told his sister that he could not help this time, as he would risk losing his job.16 As of this writing, Bashirov remains in custody and is awaiting trial.     Obstruction of Registration of Chechens in Moscow Chechens have faced increased difficulties complying with Moscow's registration requirements since the hostage crisis. Under Russian law, all permanent and temporary residents, as well as visitors, must register with the police within three days of their arrival in Moscow. While federal rules had intended a registration system based on simple notification, Moscow's registration rules amount to a licensing system.17 Many Chechens who tried to register after the hostage crisis told Human Rights Watch, Civic Assistance, and Aslakhanov's office that officials informed them they had received orders not to register any Chechens, and that they would face consequences if they did. Although a police official at one registration office confirmed the existence of such an oral order to a Civic Assistance activist, a few Chechens have been able to register with the help of local human rights groups. The vast majority of the unregistered Chechens living Moscow, however, are unable to register.  The temporary registration of the Dadaev family expired in mid-October 2002. On October 25, as the hostage crisis was still ongoing, Zarema Dadaeva tried to renew their registration at her local police precinct in southern Moscow, but was turned down. In subsequent weeks, she made two more unsuccessful attempts. Eventually, registration officials said they would reregister the Dadaev family if their landlord agreed to submit a letter in which he accepted personal responsibility for any crimes the Dadaevs might commit while living in the landlord's apartment. The landlord agreed to write such a letter. After he submitted the letter to the police, officers detained Dadaeva in a routine identity check at a metro station. They took her to the precinct where she had repeatedly tried to register, and put her in a cell. After Civic Assistance intervened, police released Dadaeva and told her to come back for her temporary registration papers later. On December 3, Dadaeva went to the police precinct again. The registration officer scolded her for complaining about him and his colleagues, saying: """"You don't know me, I'm a good man but if I register you I get into trouble..."""" Nonetheless, he eventually registered Dadaeva and her family that same day.18 """"Kheda Murdalova"""" (not her real name) and her family came to Moscow in 2000 but attempted to register only in early November 2002, after the principal of her children's school insisted that she present their registration papers. At the police precinct, registration officials told her that they would not register her and threatened her with serious consequences if she did not return to Chechnya within ten days. In the following days, Murdalova returned to the police precinct several more times to try to secure registration. On one occasion, the head of the registration office told her that he was under order not to register any Chechens and that he risked losing his job if he did not enforce it. As the ten-day deadline drew near, police officials started phoning Murdalova several times a day telling her to report to the police precinct. For weeks, she was afraid to go. When she did go on January 20, registration officials again refused to register her.19  Harrassment of Unregistered Chechens in Schools In the aftermath of the hostage taking, teachers at some Moscow schools warned parents of Chechen pupils that their children would no longer be welcome at school if they did not present valid registration papers. Some teachers referred to """"orders from above,"""" but the Moscow department of education denied the existence of such an order.20 Chechen children have also experienced increased harassment since the hostage crisis. In one case, a teacher paraded a Chechen child in front of her class, announcing that she was a Chechen.  Zarema Dadaeva, her husband, three children, and two nephews have lived in Moscow for three years. Dadaeva's son and nephew attend a local school. After the hostage crisis, the schoolmaster told Dadaeva's son and nephew that they would not be allowed to continue attending the school if they did not bring their registration documents the next day. The Dadaevs' temporary registration papers, however, had expired in October 2002 and officials at the registration office had refused to renew them. Dadaeva contacted Civic Assistance and asked its activists to intervene on her behalf. After Civic Assistance raised the issue with the schoolmaster, the latter called Dadaeva to apologize and said she had acted under pressure from the district department of education.21 Dadaeva's other children, who attend different schools, have not had similar problems. In early November, the principal of another school told Kheda Murdalova's three children to present valid registration papers or face expulsion. Murdalova, who had not registered prior to the hostage taking, has since unsuccessfully tried to register. As of this writing, her children have been able to continue to attend their school. However, a teacher recently told Murdalova's daughter that police officials had told the principal the family would """"soon be thrown out of their apartment"""" and that that would """"solve the problem.""""22  To avoid harassment, many Chechen children do not reveal their ethnic background to their peers. Civic Assistance believes harassment by peers and teachers has become more frequent since the hostage taking.  On October 25, as the hostage taking was still ongoing, a teacher at a Moscow school paraded a Chechen girl in front of her class and told the other pupils she was a Chechen. According to her caregiver, that day the teacher asked eleven-year-old Isita Gerikhanova to step up in front of the class and told the other children: """"I want you to know that Isita is Chechen."""" Gerikhanov's caregiver understood that this was done to make the girl feel uncomfortable. Gerikhanova had concealed her ethnicity until then to avoid harassment. In response to a call from Civic Assistance to the school, the principal dismissed the incident, saying Gerikhanova had misunderstood her teacher. Gerikhanova continues to attend the school and reports that her teacher has treated her well since.23  Pressure on Landlords to Evict Chechen Tenants According to Civic Assistance, police harassment of Moscow landlords renting apartments to unregistered Chechens increased since the hostage crisis. As a result, the number of evictions of Chechens in Moscow has risen significantly.  In early November, Kheda Murdalova went to the local police precinct to obtain Moscow registration papers. Registration officials declined and told her to leave Moscow within ten days. Later, Murdalova learned that the officials had summoned her landlords for questioning, fined them one hundred rubles for renting their apartment to unregistered Chechens, and gave them ten days to evict Murdalova. The officers threatened the landlords with additional fines if they refused. The landlords subsequently asked Murdalova to leave the apartment before spring. As of this writing, registration officials continued to harass the landlord about his failure to evict Murdalova.24 When the Dadaev family tried to renew their temporary registration papers in late October and early November 2002, police officials demanded that their landlord submit a letter in which he accepted personal responsibility for any crimes the Dadaevs might commit during their stay in his apartment. The landlord later told the Dadaevs that two police officers had warned him not to rent the apartment to the Dadaevs because they are Chechen.25    1 Human Rights Watch interview with Makka Shidaeva, Moscow, November 14, 2002. 2 Human Rights Watch interview with """"Kheda Murdalova"""" (not her real name), Moscow, January 20, 2003. 3 Human Rights Watch, """"Crime or Simply Punishment?

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/23/iraq-open-letter-un-security-council-debate","Iraq- Open Letter for UN Security Council Debate","Iraq: Open Letter for UN Security Council Debate","","02/23/2003","As the U.N. Security Council weighs the option of military action against Iraq to force compliance with Resolution 1441, Human Rights Watch calls on all U.N. member states to ensure that the protection of Iraq's civilians is at the forefront of its deliberations and response to this international crisis. Human Rights Watch takes no position on the legality or appropriateness of the use of military force but - from its experience of monitoring recent armed conflicts - knows all too well the human cost of war. Military action will bring new hardship to the civilian population of Iraq, who have already suffered greatly over several decades the cumulative effects of war, sanctions, and human rights abuses by their government. In recent years, the Security Council has given welcome attention to the impact of armed conflict on civilians and the best means of protecting them from the worst excesses of war. In a series of resolutions and statements, the Security Council has laid down fundamental principles on critical issues such as humanitarian access to vulnerable populations, the protection of refugees and the internally displaced, the use of landmines and the proliferation of small arms, the impact of conflict on women and children, and the longer-term imperatives of demobilization and rehabilitation.1  As the international community contemplates military action against Iraq, this agenda is especially pressing. The Security Council’s response to the Iraq crisis is a test of its commitments to protect human rights and ensure effective humanitarian action.  If the Security Council authorizes military action against Iraq, it must make explicit provisions for the protection of civilians and ensure these are effectively monitored and enforced. If war proceeds without Security Council authorization, the Council must insist that the governments of Iraq, the United States and all states participating in any conflict fully respect international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law and are held accountable for any abuses. In this context, Human Rights Watch urges the Security Council to give priority attention to the following concerns:  Obligations of attacking forces: International humanitarian law forbids direct attacks against civilians, or attacks of an indiscriminate nature. It is imperative that all parties identify and distinguish civilians from combatants in every situation. Vigorous steps must be taken to avoid mistakenly targeting civilians because of inadequate reconnaissance or intelligence. In addition, all feasible precautions should be taken to avoid harm to civilians. Military force should not be used to attack civilian morale or to destroy civilian objects for symbolic purposes when there is no direct military advantage to be gained. Nor should there be any attack on humanitarian supplies or civilian infrastructure that, even if used by an opposing military, are necessary for the survival of the civilian population in the conditions of scarcity now prevailing in Iraq. It is also generally forbidden to direct attacks against civilian objects, such as homes and apartments, places of worship, hospitals, schools, or cultural monuments, unless they are being used for military purposes. Even then, civilian objects should not be attacked if the harm to civilians from that attack is excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.  Possible Iraqi abuses: The prospect of fighting in urban areas in Iraq poses additional challenges for the protection of civilians. Judging by Iraq’s past conduct, there is a substantial possibility that Iraqi authorities may use civilians as shields for military targets. The international community should make clear that such tactics are prohibited under international humanitarian law and that Iraqi officials will be held accountable if they employ them. At the same time, they do not excuse the opposing forces from the duty to refrain from attacking if harm to civilians from an attack is excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. Equally, preventive action should be taken to protect civilians in the Kurdish areas in the north and Shia areas in the south should the Iraqi authorities strike out internally against these groups. A clear signal should be sent that anyone who carries out deliberate atrocities against Iraqi civilians will be prosecuted. The desire to encourage defections must not be allowed to obscure this essential message.  Responsibilities of occupying forces: The United States and its coalition partners must be prepared to protect and provide assistance to all potential victims of such attacks in areas of the country under their effective control. If Turkish troops occupy areas of Iraq inhabited by ethnic Kurds, those troops must be particularly vigilant in protecting the Kurds from attacks by other groups. Furthermore, Turkish troops must ensure that they protect Iraqi Kurds as required by international law.  Weapons of mass destruction and other indiscriminate weapons: We condemn unequivocally any use of weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, and the Security Council should make clear that any party which does so, whether in first use or reprisal, will be held to account. We also oppose the use of antipersonnel landmines as prohibited by the 1997 Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty, and the use of cluster munitions near populated areas or in any circumstance until the initial failure rate of submunitions can be radically reduced.  Prevent abuses by Iraqi opposition groups: The United States and its coalition partners will have a special responsibility for the conduct of any allied forces, for instance Kurdish or other Iraqi opposition groups enlisted in support of military action. The US-led coalition will also have responsibility for the conduct of all forces in territory they seize. No military assistance should be provided to armed groups or their commanders with a known record of human rights abuse. Occupied territory should be vigorously patrolled to avoid the emergence of a security vacuum and to guard against retribution and revenge killing if war against Iraq triggers intense inter-ethnic fighting or attacks against supporters of the government. The Security Council should insist that all armed groups inside Iraq fully respect human rights and humanitarian law norms, including in the treatment of prisoners, and warn their leaders that those responsible for atrocities will be brought to justice.  Safeguard children: The Security Council should impress upon all warring parties the fundamental importance of protecting children in armed conflict, and ensure their special needs are fully addressed in any military and humanitarian planning. No personnel under the age of 18 years should be deployed militarily by any party to the conflict.  Prevent and punish crimes against women: The Security Council should also insist that all warring parties protect women from gender-specific violence, including rape and other sexual violence. The Security Council should commit the international community to investigating and punishing any such violations of humanitarian law.  Ensure humanitarian preparations and access: As the Secretary-General has noted, Iraq’s civilian population is already in a precarious and vulnerable state, raising the potential for a humanitarian crisis. The humanitarian response will be greatly complicated by the limited humanitarian presence in the country, the Iraqi government’s tight controls, and the possible destruction of vital infrastructure. An occupying force is obligated under international law to ensure the security and welfare of the civilian population. Any planning for military action should be accompanied by a comprehensive and well funded humanitarian plan, providing secure and unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations and respecting the independence and impartiality of humanitarian personnel. In addition, the Security Council should continue to monitor closely the humanitarian consequences of the sanctions it has authorized in Iraq, and take into account the well-being of the civilian population when applying coercive measures.  Open borders to refugees: Fleeing civilians may face closed borders blocking access to safety. In 1991, tens of thousands of fleeing Kurds became stuck on the closed Turkish border, many freezing to death. Iraq’s neighboring states must be encouraged and supported to open their borders to refugees and provide them with adequate protection. The establishment of camps, “safe havens,” or “humanitarian zones” within Iraq should not be used as a justification for barring Iraqis from fleeing violence in their country or for failing to consider their asylum applications. When refugees or displaced people are held in camps, armed elements should be separated from civilians. The security of all refugees, displaced, and humanitarian workers should be guaranteed.  Ensure accountability for war crimes on all sides: The Security Council should commit now to an international process that will bring to justice those responsible for grave violations in the conduct of hostilities. Like the International Criminal Tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, this mechanism should have jurisdiction over all parties to the armed conflict. The Security Council should also appoint a special commission of experts to examine and recommend options for pursuing justice and accountability for grave abuses committed in the past in Iraq, including the establishment of an appropriate international tribunal. Human Rights Watch notes the pledges floated by some individual governments that they would not prosecute Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and other members of his government if they were to leave Iraq. Whatever the merits of these potential pledges as a way of avoiding war, we vigorously oppose any formal amnesty, especially one endorsed by the Security Council. Amnesty is unnecessary; Iraqi officials considering exile would do so only if they already have little bargaining power. Moreover, amnesty would be an affront to the victims of the Iraqi government’s genocide against the Kurds and the countless victims of its war crimes and crimes against humanity against Iraqis of all ethnic and religious persuasions and others. It would also undermine efforts to deter future atrocities by signaling that even one of the world’s most heinous human rights criminals can, in the end, definitively avoid criminal liability.  The Security Council today carries a heavy responsibility to protect not only international peace and security but also the human security of Iraq’s long-suffering people. Over the past few years, the Council has made important commitments to the protection of civilians in armed conflict and has sought to implement these commitments through its interventions with respect to individual countries such as Sierra Leone and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is essential that these human rights and humanitarian concerns be at the forefront of the Council’s response to the Iraq crisis.

Security Council Resolution Should Protect Iraqi Civilians","","02/23/2003","If a resolution authorizing war against Iraq is passed by the United Nations Security Council, it must include clear and concrete protections for civilians, Human Rights Watch said today.    The United States and United Kingdom are slated to introduce a new resolution today authorizing military action to force Iraq's compliance with Resolution 1441. In an open letter to Security Council members, Human Rights Watch highlighted serious dangers civilians would face in any conflict. Human Rights Watch takes no position on whether war against Iraq is justified or legal. However, if war occurs, Human Rights Watch stressed that the Security Council should anticipate and try to minimize the risks to civilians.  """"If there's war in Iraq, civilians will bear the brunt of the suffering,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Intense pressure from the Security Council may be the only hope for preventing a humanitarian disaster."""" Drawing upon its experience monitoring the 1991 Gulf War, NATO interventions in the Balkans, and the recent conflict in Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch highlighted several critical issues: Attacking forces: U.S.-led forces should avoid problematic practices of recent wars, including armed attacks on civilian morale as well as attacks on essential infrastructure and humanitarian goods even if used by opposing military forces. U.S. commanders should also heighten scrutiny of mobile targets to prevent repetition of prior attacks in which civilians were mistakenly attacked. Possible Iraqi abuses: There is a substantial possibility that if war begins, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will order attacks on Iraqi civilians, particularly in the north or south of the country, or use them as human shields. The Security Council should make it clear that anyone who orders or carries out atrocities against Iraqi civilians will be prosecuted for war crimes. The desire to encourage defections must not be allowed to obscure this essential message. The same message should be sent to Iraqi opposition groups who might, as during the 1991 uprising, summarily execute government officials and perceived government supporters. In addition, the United States and its coalition partners must be prepared to patrol vigorously areas that come under their effective control to protect the potential victims of such attacks.  Weapons of mass destruction: Weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, must not be used by any party, whether in first strike or reprisal. There is no conceivable justification in Iraq for any use of weapons of mass destruction. Other indiscriminate weapons: There should be no use of anti-personnel landmines in any circumstance, of cluster munitions near populated areas, or of any cluster munitions unless the initial failure rate of submunitions can be radically reduced. Humanitarian preparations and access: Any occupying force is legally required to ensure the security and welfare of the civilian population. Given the high dependence of most Iraqis on state rations, and the fact that more than a decade of sanctions has depleted personal and family resources for many, a comprehensive, well funded humanitarian plan needs to be in place before the commencement of hostilities. Military forces should provide safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian agencies and respect their impartiality and neutrality.  Refugees: In 1991, Turkey closed its borders to tens of thousands of fleeing Kurds. Many froze to death. If war breaks out, Iraq's neighbors must be pressed to open their borders to refugees and to provide them adequate protection. The establishment of camps, """"safe havens,"""" or """"humanitarian zones"""" within Iraq will not be sufficient. Accountability for war crimes: The Security Council should commit now to an international process that will bring to justice those who are responsible from any side for grave violations in the conduct of hostilities. The Security Council should also appoint a special commission of experts to examine and recommend options for pursuing justice for grave abuses committed in the past in Iraq, including the establishment of an appropriate international tribunal.

Clare Short, the Secretary of State for International Development, is due to chair the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to be held in the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan in May. Uzbekistan is distinguished by human rights abuses on an epic scale. And yet it looks as if the meeting will go ahead with no real strings attached. This makes no sense at all.

Clare Short, the Secretary of State for International Development, is due to chair the annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), to be held in the central Asian republic of Uzbekistan in May. Uzbekistan is distinguished by human rights abuses on an epic scale. And yet it looks as if the meeting will go ahead with no real strings attached. This makes no sense at all. It amounts to a reward for (very) bad behaviour. A United Nations special rapporteur talked of the """"systemic torture"""" that he found; the British ambassador rightly notes that """"brutality is inherent"""" in the government of President Islam Karimov, a survivor from the Soviet era. Police in Uzbekistan use electric shock, beatings and rape to compel confessions. They asphyxiate detainees with plastic bags, sprinkle chlorine in gas masks and shut off the air. In basement cells, they hang men naked by their wrists and ankles. In one case last year, doctors found that burns on the body of a prisoner who died in custody were caused by immersion in boiling water. The hands had no fingernails. That is the style of the Karimov regime. And yet Short has so far flatly rejected any suggestion that Karimov should make a few small concessions towards good governance in the run-up to the meeting. The mandate of the EBRD, whose majority shareholders are the governments of the European Union, is explicitly political. Its role was clear from the time of its foundation, after the revolutions of 1989: to help foster democracy and market economies in the former communist bloc. Jean Lemierre, the president of the bank, continues to talk of the Tashkent meeting as an """"incentive to democracy."""" With the bank unwilling to make Uzbekistan work for its """"incentive,"""" it looks like nothing of the sort. Rather, this prestigious meeting is in danger of appearing to be a bonus plan for repression. The EBRD's website, encouraging participation in the Tashkent meeting, praises the joys of tourism in Uzbekistan, including the golden road to Samarkand and the wonders of Bukhara. On human rights abuses - nothing. There is a time and a place for quiet diplomacy but this is not it. By continued inaction - however well-intentioned it may be - Britain and the bank encourage the Uzbek government to believe that it can continue with censorship, arbitrary arrests and the torture and killing of government critics, or of those whose religious beliefs are considered unacceptable. All participants are eager to emphasise that tough words will be spoken at the meeting in May. By then, however, such words will be much less powerful than if they were spoken today. The muzzled Uzbek media are unlikely to give much publicity to tough talk once the meeting is under way. Critical speeches can easily be lost without trace, as Theo van Boven, the UN special rapporteur on torture, discovered during his outspoken visit at the end of last year. There is still time for Britain to change this ultimately futile approach. The threat of moving the venue could help concentrate Karimov's mind, even at this late stage. Clare Short and her colleagues could make it clear to Karimov that if he wants to avoid embarrassment all round and make the meeting a success, he should take a few easy steps to curb torture, release jailed human rights activists and allow human rights groups to register. Uzbekistan has been eager since 9/11 to use the """"war against terrorism"""" as an excuse for repression. It wants to portray itself as a loyal ally - and was quick to praise Colin Powell's speech on Iraq at the UN earlier this month. But neither his political usefulness nor the widespread poverty in the region can be an excuse for letting Karimov off the hook. Short talks of the need for """"external engagement"""" with impoverished countries such as Uzbekistan. But security, poverty and human rights cannot be treated as separate issues. They are intricately interlinked – the essential elements of sustainable development. Pressing for human rights progress signals a meaningful engagement that does more than give power to the corrupt and abusive dictators at the top. The British government must ensure that the message is heard, loud and clear. It is also an important message for ordinary Uzbeks to hear -and for corrupt rulers in the region, who might seek to persuade themselves that democracy is a mere optional extra, when seeking loans and expertise. The potential dividends are huge - and only institutional lethargy stands in the way.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","Torture"

In releasing a new fourteen-page briefing paper, International Humanitarian Law Issues in a Potential War in Iraq, Human Rights Watch outlined a range of grave risks for Iraq's civilian population, including the prospect of extensive urban combat, the possible use of human shields and weapons of mass destruction, and the dependence of Iraqis on humanitarian assistance for food and medical supplies.  In a news conference yesterday, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld said that the use of human shields in Iraq would be a violation of the laws of war and a crime against humanity, but failed to note U.S. legal responsibilities if human shields were used.  """"If Iraq uses people as human shields, that is a war crime,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But Secretary Rumsfeld told only half the story yesterday. If the United States attacks targets that are shielded by civilians without demonstrating an overwhelming military necessity to do so, that would be a war crime, too.""""  The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Myers, has said that the U.S. military would take any possible civilian shields into account when making targeting decisions.  Human Rights Watch takes no position on the legality of the use of military force, including possible U.S.-led military action in Iraq. Its work on Iraq focuses on continuing human rights abuses and, if there is a war, the compliance by all parties with international humanitarian law and protections for Iraqi civilians.  """"International humanitarian law is not just a tool to be used against Baghdad,"""" said Roth. """"It also imposes essential obligations on the United States and its allies in a possible war with Iraq.""""  Iraq has used human shields at least twice in the past, during the 1991 Persian Gulf War and in advance of U.S. and British bombardment in 1998. The Iraqi government says it will use foreign volunteers and possibly Iraqi citizens as human shields, but that would clearly violate international humanitarian law regardless of the willingness of the civilians involved.  Human Rights Watch urged all parties to a potential conflict in Iraq to:  separate and distinguish military objectives from civilian populations, renounce the use of weapons of mass destruction and other indiscriminate or inhumane weapons, and make immediate preparations to secure public order and assistance necessary to the survival of the civilian population in occupied areas. Human Rights Watch in its briefing paper analyzed these issues in light of past Iraqi and U.S. practice, and evolving standards of international law. Among its conclusions:  No party to a conflict in Iraq would be legally justified in using any weapon of mass destruction - chemical, biological or nuclear -- under any circumstances. In the event of urban warfare, defending forces must avoid locating military objectives near populated areas, and attacking forces must provide adequate warnings and escape routes to civilians. Armed attacks designed to undermine civilian morale are illegal. So-called dual-use targets that are essential to the survival of the civilian population, such as electrical generation facilities, must not be attacked. Other dual-use targets should, insofar as possible, only be incapacitated, not destroyed, if attacked. Before a target is attacked, every effort must be made to correctly identify the target. Only precision munitions should be used in air attacks on populated areas. Antipersonnel landmines and cluster bombs must not be used. The United States and its allies must immediately provide security and humanitarian services for the civilians in any territory they come to control. Journalists and human rights monitors should be given maximum access to assess the effect of war on civilians. """"The dangers to civilians are high enough from any war,"""" says Roth. """"Strict respect for international humanitarian law is essential if these risks are to be minimized in Iraq.""""","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Iraq",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/20/unfinished-assignment-israelis","An Unfinished Assignment for Israelis","An Unfinished Assignment for Israelis","","02/20/2003","BRUSSELS -- Israel has reacted angrily to a ruling by Belgium's Supreme Court that leaves the way open for an investigation into the alleged role of Ariel Sharon in a 1982 massacre. Yet Belgium is doing what all countries are supposed to do - enforcing the most basic norms of humanity. Belgian law, like that of many other nations, incorporates the principle of universal jurisdiction. This holds that every state has an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of certain atrocities no matter where they were committed. Israel itself breathed life into this principle in the case of Adolf Eichmann. In 1960, Israeli forces snatched Eichmann from Argentina and put him on trial for his part in the Holocaust. The Israeli Supreme Court held that the """"peculiarly universal character"""" of crimes against humanity vests in every state the authority to try and punish anyone who participated in their commission. Increasingly aware of their own abusive history in Africa, Belgians have embraced the opportunity to play a role in the fight against the worst crimes. Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have also brought suspects to trial on the basis of universal jurisdiction. The breakthrough for its use was Spain's indictment in 1998 of Augusto Pinochet for killings and torture committed during his rule in Chile. The United States, too, exercises universal jurisdiction, although mostly in civil cases. In the most famous criminal case, the family of a Paraguayan boy tortured to death sued his torturer who had come to the United States. A U.S. court of appeals, in upholding jurisdiction, declared that """"the torturer has become like the pirate and slave trader before him, an enemy of all mankind."""" Until recently, it seemed that if you killed one person you went to jail but if you slaughtered thousands you usually got away with it. Universal jurisdiction is international law's answer to this wall of immunity. The massacre of more than 700 civilians in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla, in which Sharon is allegedly implicated, is a case in point. There is abundant evidence that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed, but not a single individual has been brought to justice. As defense minister, Sharon had overall responsibility for the Israeli Defense Forces. He allowed Lebanese Phalangist militias to enter the camps, where they went on a three-day rampage of killing and mutilation while Israeli forces failed to intervene. In February 1983, an official Israeli commission of inquiry named Sharon as one of the individuals who """"bears personal responsibility"""" for the massacre. Yet neither Sharon nor any other official has been investigated criminally for this evident atrocity. Because Israel has refused to act, it is only natural for the Sabra and Shatilla victims to seek justice elsewhere. Rather than fuming at Belgium for doing what all countries should do but few dare, Israel should preempt Belgium by completing its own unfinished business.","Europe/Central Asia, Belgium",""

Police often use the charge as a pretext to clear the streets of children, extort money and information, force children to move on to other neighborhoods, and bring children in for questioning in the absence of evidence of criminal wrongdoing.   """"The government says it arrests children to protect them,"""" said Clarisa Bencomo, researcher in Human Rights Watch's Children's Rights Division. """"The reality is that most of these children are back on the street within a week, in even worse shape than before. Instead of protecting children, the police abuse them and steal whatever money they have.""""   The 87-page report, """"Charged with Being Children: Egyptian Police Abuse of Children in Need of Protection,"""" draws on interviews with dozens of Egyptian children living or working on the street, as well as police, prosecutors, social workers and judges in the juvenile justice system.   Human Rights Watch called on the Egyptian government to immediately end its policies of arresting children it deems """"vulnerable to delinquency"""" and of routinely detaining children in police lockups. Egypt should also designate a full time position in the Ministry of Justice to oversee investigations of torture and ill-treatment of children in police custody.   Human Rights Watch found that police in Cairo routinely beat children with batons, whips, rubber hoses and belts, and transport them in dangerous vehicles, often with adult detainees. Children held in overcrowded and dirty adult police lockups must bribe guards or beg from criminal detainees to obtain food and bedding. Children who are transferred to the overcrowded al Azbekiya juvenile police lockup receive only marginally better treatment, and may be detained with children significantly older or who have committed serious crimes.   """"Children are particularly vulnerable to sexual abuse, both in and out of custody,"""" said Bencomo.  Police at adult and juvenile police lockups use degrading sexual language to humiliate both boys and girls, and do not protect children from attacks by adult detainees. In interviews, girls singled out police at the al Azbekiya juvenile police lockup and an adult police lockup as being notorious for sexual abuse and violence against girls detained there. Girls also reported feeling pressure to engage in sexual relations with police on the street as the only way to obtain police protection from sexual violence by other men.   Despite the widespread and systematic violations of the rights of children in police custody, Egyptian authorities do not routinely monitor conditions of detention for children, investigate cases of arbitrary arrests or abuse in custody, or appropriately discipline those responsible. In many cases, children are detained illegally for days before going before the public prosecutor, and in some cases children are arrested and released without ever leaving the police station. Police often do not notify children's parents about arrests, and children who have fled parental abuse or who lack guardians have no one to turn to for assistance.   """"Ministry of Interior officials, prosecutors, judges, and government social workers all know that these children are being abused -- but no one does anything to prevent it,"""" Bencomo said. """"The government would rather keep these children out of sight than address the underlying issues that forced children onto the streets in the first place.""""   The vast majority of children Human Rights Watch interviewed were living or working on the street because they had no other choice.   Human Rights Watch calls on the Egyptian government to ensure these children receive the special protection and assistance they are entitled to under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and to ensure that arrest, detention or imprisonment are used only for children charged with criminal acts, and should always be a measure of last resort, and for the shortest possible time.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/19/uganda-letter-minister-justice","Uganda- Letter to Minister of Justice","Uganda: Letter to Minister of Justice","","02/19/2003","February 19, 2003  Mrs. Janat Mukwaya Minister of Justice Government of Uganda Parliament Building P.O. Box 7183, Kampala Uganda   Fax: 256 41 230 802  Your Excellency,   Human Rights Watch is concerned about the Government of Uganda's bringing charges of treason against two boys, ages fourteen and sixteen, who were forcibly abducted into the Lord's Resistance Army and are currently released on bail pending their hearing. We urge you to immediately drop the treason charges against these boys, and to assist them in their rehabilitation.   According to documents received by Human Rights Watch, the two boys, fourteen-year old I.G.*, from Padiga Metu Parish, and sixteen-year old O.D.*, from Pukile Amuru Division, were charged with treason in late 2002 in criminal cases JA004 and JA006 respectively.   After their initial court hearing on January 31 was postponed, they are now due to return to court on February 20, 2003.   A representative of Human Rights Watch met with both boys on February 6, 2003. According to their testimony, the two -like thousands of other children in Northern Uganda- were forcibly abducted by the LRA and forced to fight against the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and the Ugandan People's Defense Force (UPDF). Both reported to Human Rights Watch that they voluntarily surrendered to the UPDF and have not been told the basis for the treason charges against them.   Treason is a capital offense under Ugandan law, although the death penalty may not be imposed upon those below the age of eighteen at the time of the offense (Trial on Indictments Decree 26 of 1971, Section 104(1).)  Nevertheless, treason is a serious charge and should not be imposed against children. Children are inherently different from adults, and lack an adult's maturity and judgment. In the context of the Northern Uganda conflict, where children are routinely forcibly abducted, severely brutalized and compelled to participate in acts of violence, they are rarely autonomous actors.  Human Rights Watch notes that I.C. and O.D. may qualify for amnesty under the Amnesty Act of 2000, and further notes that under the principles of international humanitarian law, it is recommended that authorities grant the broadest possible amnesty to persons who have participated in armed conflict.   Uganda is also a state party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. The protocol prohibits the forced recruitment of children or their use in hostilities by both governmental and non-governmental armed groups. It obliges states parties to """"take all feasible measures to ensure that persons within their jurisdiction recruited or used in hostilities contrary to the present Protocol are demobilized or otherwise released from service. States Parties shall, when necessary, accord to such persons all appropriate assistance for their physical and psychological recovery and their social reintegration."""" (Article 6)   The imposition of treason charges runs contrary to Uganda's obligations under the protocol. In addition, the charge of treason in these cases appear to be arbitrarily imposed, since thousands of children with similar experiences have not been similarly charged, and have been able to receive rehabilitation assistance and to return to their communities.    Human Rights Watch urges that the government of Uganda:  Immediately drop treason charges against Igama Charles and Oyoo David; Release them to World Vision or GUSCO, to enable both boys to receive rehabilitation and reintegration assistance.Issue public statements that children will not be subject to treason charges, and ensure that such statements are broadly disseminated throughout Northern Uganda.  Thank you for your attention.   Sincerely,   Lois Whitman Executive Director  * Names of the boys are withheld because of their status as children and to protect their privacy.","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

On Monday, February 17, troops of the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) arrested three former Kosovo Liberation Army members on war crimes charges. According to the ICTY indictment, the three served as wartime “commanders/guards” at a prison camp in the Glogovac/Gllogofc area and are charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity against Kosovo Serb and Albanian civilians in mid-1998. Haradin Bala, Isak Musliu and Agim Murtezi are the first Kosovo Albanians publicly indicted by the ICTY. Authorities in Serbia have argued that the absence of indictments of Kosovo Albanians is evidence of the tribunal's bias against Serbs.  “These indictments defeat the claims of the Tribunal's critics that it was ignoring abuses committed by Kosovo Albanian rebels,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. “It is clear that the Tribunal prosecutor will issue indictments against alleged war criminals on all sides, if and when she gathers compelling evidence. Authorities in the region should do more to assist the tribunal in that effort.”  The Tribunal had also issued a fourth arrest warrant for Fatmir Limaj, a former member of the KLA general staff. According to some press reports on Tuesday evening, Limaj was taken into custody outside Kosovo earlier that day and was about to be transferred to The Hague. The indictment against the four contains nine counts of unlawful imprisonment, torture, murder and the cruel treatment of Kosovo Serb and Albanian civilians held at the Lapusnik/Llapushnik Prison Camp of the KLA. According to the indictment, Limaj was “responsible for the operation” of the prison camp.  Human Rights Watch welcomed the recent arrests but cautioned that they are only one step on the long road to a full accounting of crimes committed in Kosovo. Human Rights Watch urged the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro and U.N.-administered Kosovo to step up efforts to prosecute persons implicated in war crimes. “There is still a huge justice gap relating to Kosovo,” Andersen said. “The Tribunal should hold the most senior alleged war criminals of all sides accountable, but accountability for lower-level war criminals is also vital to long-term hopes of reconciliation.”  Human Rights Watch said that the local authorities who must bring lower-level perpetrators to justice have to date not risen to the task.  Serbian courts have opened only three war crimes cases so far arising from the 1998-99 events in Kosovo, although the number of perpetrators within their jurisdiction is in the hundreds. At the same time, the ICTY and the Kosovo courts have a huge task to prosecute crimes against non-Albanians during and after the war. After three and a half years of international administration, the Kosovo judiciary has failed to indict anyone for war crimes against non-Albanians, and only a handful of people have been successfully prosecuted for war crimes against Kosovo Albanians.  The ICTY indictments confirm credible reports that Kosovo Albanian rebels are responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law in multiple incidents during the 1998-1999 armed conflict with the Belgrade forces. In that same conflict, Serbian forces waged a campaign of massive killings, expulsions and destruction against Kosovo’s ethnic Albanian population.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The circumstances strongly suggest that these were political killings,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government must launch a prompt and impartial investigation into this vicious crime, and must guarantee the safety of the reported witness to the killings.""""  Darwin Arguello, an army soldier, Angel Salas, a navy corporal, and Félix Pinto, an airman, were reportedly abducted together in Caracas during the night of February 15. The following day, police discovered Pinto's body and that of a twenty-eight-year-old woman, Zaida Perozo López, close to a highway in the state of Miranda, some forty kilometers east of Caracas.  The bodies of Arguello and Salas were discovered nearby a day later. All four had been bound, gagged with tape and shot repeatedly.  A fourteen-year-old girl, whose name has not been revealed, is believed to have witnessed at least one of the killings and to have been shot and left for dead. She is recovering in a hospital.  Arguello, Salas, and Pinto had joined a protest by dissident military officers against the Chávez government and had participated in opposition gatherings in the Plaza Altamira, a square where anti-Chávez activists have been camped for more than three months. Zaida Perozo is also reported to have frequented the square.  A witness to the abductions said that he had seen the victims being forced by men wearing ski-masks into two vehicles a short distance away from the Plaza Altamira.  The political situation in Venezuela remains tense in the wake of a two-month general strike called by the opposition Coordinadora Democrática, the business group Fedecámeras, and the country's largest union federation. President Chavez has rejected opposition demands for a constitutional reform to permit early elections, and has threatened tough measures against the strikers and against private television networks that supported the strike.  At least seven people have been killed and scores injured in street protests since December 2002, but there have been no confirmed reports of extrajudicial executions of opposition or government supporters.","Americas, Venezuela",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/17/turkmen-leader-should-mark-birthday-introducing-rule-law","Turkmen Leader Should Mark Birthday by Introducing Rule of Law","Turkmen Leader Should Mark Birthday by Introducing Rule of Law","","02/17/2003","President Saparmurat Niazov of Turkmenistan should mark his birthday by committing himself to protect human rights, a coalition of human rights groups said today.  President Niazov's birthday, February 19, is a major event in Turkmenistan. Turkmenistan has long had an appalling human rights record. An armed attack on President Niazov last November triggered a new wave of repression throughout the country.  Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, the International League for Human Rights, and Memorial Human Rights Center today called on President Niazov to release those arbitrarily or unlawfully detained, permit visits to those imprisoned, grant human rights monitors access to Turkmenistan, and ensure fair and public retrials for those convicted at unfair trials in relation to the November attack.  A series of actions is planned for President Niazov's birthday. Amnesty International is coordinating a birthday card web action and demonstrations at Turkmen embassies.  For the past decade President Niazov has presided over a disastrous human rights situation. The government tolerates no dissent, tightly controls the media and curtails freedom of expression. The only sanctioned religions are Sunni Islam and Russian Orthodoxy; other religious faiths are persecuted. Ethnic minorities are discriminated against. Freedom of movement is severely restricted. The government does not allow non-governmental human rights organizations to operate. It has banned the circus, opera, and philharmonic orchestra, and closed the Academy of Sciences. Though the new wave of repression is extraordinary, it nevertheless reflects the harsh practices that human rights groups have documented throughout recent years.  On November 25, 2002 gunmen assaulted the president's armored motorcade, injuring one person. President Niazov was unharmed. According to official reports, 67 people have been arrested on charges of involvement in the assassination attempt, although many believe the figures to be higher. Fifty-nine people have been convicted in closed trials by the Supreme Court and Ashgabat City Court, which lack judicial independence. Eight were given sentences of life imprisonment—three were sentenced in absentia—and 51 were given sentences ranging from five to twenty-five years of imprisonment. The defendants did not have attorneys of their own choosing, and some of the government-appointed attorneys reportedly expressed, in public, disgust at the prospect of defending their clients. Many of the detainees were reportedly tortured and ill-treated to force them to confess or to incriminate others.  Many of those detained are family members of those associated with Turkmenistan's opposition-in-exile. Family members have been denied access to their arrested relatives, and many have no information about their well-being or whereabouts. Other relatives have been threatened with arrest and subjected to eviction from their homes, relentless harassment and surveillance. There is little doubt that the intent is to pressure exiles to return, and to compel those in custody to confess or give testimony.  Throughout the past decade the rule of law has been so thoroughly degraded in Turkmenistan that an effective investigation—ensuring due process rights—and fair trial of the perpetrators of the November 25 assassination attempt is highly unlikely. In the past the Turkmen authorities have tortured dissidents and sentenced them to long prison terms. Among them is Mukhametkuli Aimuradov, convicted in 1995 of a number of charges, including """"attempted terrorism"""", and sentenced to 12 years' imprisonment after a reportedly unfair trial. In December 1998, an additional 18 years imprisonment was added to his sentence in connection with an alleged prison escape attempt.  Among those arrested in the post November 25 crackdown is an environmental activist, Farid Tukhbatullin, who is believed to be a prisoner of conscience and held because of his non-violent environmental advocacy.  The coalition of human rights organizations urges President Niazov to:  · Immediately and unconditionally release Farid Tukhbatullin and Mukhametkuli Aimuradov; · Investigate all allegations of torture and ill-treatment and take appropriate action against all those responsible; · Cease persecuting all persons -- who exercise their right to freedom of expression, including non-violent political dissent -- and their family members;  With regard to those detained for the November 25 attack,  · End incommunicado detention; allow family members to visit them in prison and deliver essential food and medicines; · Ensure fair and public retrials that meet international due process standards of anyone convicted at unfair trials; · Allow human rights monitors to operate in Turkmenistan.","Europe/Central Asia, Turkmenistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/commission-human-rights-reform","Commission on Human Rights Reform","Commission on Human Rights Reform","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights","02/14/2003","Objective  Human Rights Watch calls on members to ensure the current review of the Commission is not used to undermine the body's effectiveness, but further strengthens its capacity to monitor, address and, where necessary, censure human rights violations. Furthermore, the review process should not divert the energy and resources of the CHR from its most essential duties, i.e. monitoring, protection and promotion of human rights. HRW highlights the membership of the Commission and the role of the Special Procedures as particularly critical issues.   Background  The 58th session of the Commission on Human Rights has often been described as the most difficult in recent memory. Among the many contributing factors were the changing nature of the Commission membership and session time cuts which impacted negatively on the Special Procedures of the Commission, whose speaking time was cut to a symbolic minimum.   On the last day of the 58th session, the Commission adopted the resolution entitled """"Enhancement of the working methods of the Commission"""" (2002/91), sponsored by Cuba, in which it decided to reopen the process of the review of the functioning of the Commission, including its mechanisms. Under the terms of the Resolution, the Office of the High Commissioner has compiled a series of proposals, based on submissions from member states, regional groups, NGOs, and others. This compilation will be submitted to the 59th session of the Commission.   Membership  In recent years, the membership of the Commission has changed significantly, with countries with poor human rights records gaining seats on the CHR and aggressively working toward making the Commission less hard hitting and relevant.   A state's willingness to cooperate with the CHR's Special Procedures should be a condition of eligibility for Commission membership. The Commission should insist that member states of the CHR or governments aspiring to membership of this body issue a standing invitation to all thematic Special Procedures of the CHR. Since the Special Procedures have all been established by resolutions of the Commission and since country missions are part of the working methods to fulfill their mandates, we believe that this would be a logical consequence of this membership. Thus, a standing invitation should be issued by all member states already serving or interested to serve as members.   In addition, governments willing to serve as CHR members should ratify key international human rights treaties and their optional protocols and should have a record of timely submissions of periodic reports to the treaty monitoring bodies.   Furthermore, governments which have been censured by the Commission in recent years for systematic or widespread abuses should not be elected to this body. Experience teaches that the participation of such governments in the Commission is often focused on minimizing the exposure of their own human rights record rather than on stigmatizing the worst human rights violations in the world and devising methods to bring about effective responses to these abuses.   These requirements should in particular be strictly observed with respect to governments seeking to be members of the CHR Bureau.   Special Procedures  The scenario that unfolded during the 58th session of the CHR when Special Rapporteurs and members of the Working Groups were disproportionately affected by time cuts must not be repeated.   Recommendations  The Commission needs to ensure that:  Each mandate holder be allocated sufficient time for his or her presentation and afforded an opportunity of a meaningful exchange with members during the plenary session of the CHR.  A segment should be created at the beginning of each CHR agenda item for the presentation and discussion of Special Procedures' reports of up to one hour per procedure, as is the current practice at the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly.  At each session there should be regular, focused and systematic deliberations on serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation by governments with the Commission or its mechanisms.  The Commission should request the Office of the High Commissioner to submit annually a country-by-country compilation of information and recommendations from the Special Procedures for the previous twelve months. The report should include information on the implementation of Special Procedures' recommendations and follow-up thereto.  The Commission should request the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a list of countries which CHR mechanisms have sought to visit, including information on the date of the first request by the mechanism, the response of the government, the status of discussions on a visit (if any) and the dates of the proposed visit.  For country‑specific mandates, the Commission's effectiveness and efficiency might be enhanced by establishing terms exceeding a single year where appropriate, as is the case with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967.","Global","United Nations"

As almost any participant or observer would agree after the difficult session last year, the very credibility and integrity of the CHR are now at stake. It is of the utmost importance that governments ensure that the upcoming review of the working methods of the CHR strengthen this body's most important functions: the protection, promotion and monitoring of human rights. The best way to enhance the Commission's standing will be to make sure that it addresses adequately the most pressing current human rights crises and problems.   We therefore respectfully call to your attention the following issues and recommendations on specific steps the CHR should take.  Human Rights and Counter Terrorism  The Reform of the Commission on Human Rights  International Standards  The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders  Special Envoy for the Abducted Children in Northern Uganda  Human Rights of Asylum Seekers and Refugees  China  Colombia  Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  Iran  Israel/Occupied Territories  Russian Federation/Chechnya  Sudan  Turkmenistan   Human Rights and Counter Terrorism  While governments have a responsibility to protect their citizens in the face of terrorist threats, counter terrorism measures have had a negative impact on human rights in many countries around the world. The Secretary-General has raised his concerns repeatedly, both at the Security Council and at the Commission, saying that there must be no trade-off between human rights and fighting terrorism. The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Sergio Vieira de Mello has pursued the issue actively and, among others, addressed the Counter Terrorism Committee in New York. The General Assembly during its 57th session unanimously passed a resolution, sponsored by Mexico, reaffirming the importance of respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in combating terrorism. During its 59th session, the Commission on Human Rights will be receiving a report from the Secretary-General on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. It will be incumbent on the Commission to take action on this issue.   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution on the protection of human rights in countering terrorism that would:  Emphasize the importance of the respect for international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law in combating terrorism.          Ask the High Commissioner to continue his leadership role in coordinating and encouraging the work of all relevant U.N. bodies and organs on matters related to terrorism and human rights; to make recommendations on safeguarding human rights in combating terrorism; and to seek, receive and exchange information from all relevant sources, including governments, international and non-governmental organizations for these purposes.          Ask the High Commissioner to create a dedicated unit within his office to support this work on human rights and counter terrorism.          Request relevant CHR special procedures and the U.N. treaty bodies to monitor counter terrorism measures adopted and implemented by member states.          Ask the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative on Human Rights and Counter Terrorism who would examine the effect of counter terrorism measures, law and practices on human rights in countries worldwide; examine the compatibility of these measures, laws and practices with international law, in particular international human rights law; and make specific and timely recommendations to states on safeguarding human rights in the struggle against terrorism.       The Reform of the Commission on Human Rights   The 58th session of the Commission on Human Rights has often been described as the most difficult in recent memory. Among the many contributing factors were the changing nature of the Commission membership and the negative impact of session time cuts on the CHR Special Procedures whose speaking time was reduced to a symbolic minimum. The current review of the CHR needs to address these two issues in particular. At the same time it is important that this issue does not pull the energy and resources of the CHR away from its most essential duties, i.e. monitoring, protection and promotion of human rights.   In recent years, the membership of the Commission has changed significantly, with countries with poor human rights records gaining seats on the CHR and aggressively working toward making the Commission less credible and less relevant.   The Commission should insist that member states of the CHR or governments aspiring to membership of the CHR should meet, as a minimum, the following criteria:  ratify the main human rights treaties,          fulfill obligations to provide reports on their compliance with conventions already ratified,          issue a standing invitation to U.N. investigators, and          not have been condemned by the Commission in the recent past.       These requirements should be particularly observed with respect to governments seeking to be members of the CHR Bureau.   With respect to the CHR Special Procedures, Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to ensure that:  Each mandate holder be allocated sufficient time for his or her presentation and afforded an opportunity for a meaningful exchange with members during the plenary session of the CHR.          A segment should be created at the beginning of each respective CHR agenda item for the presentation and discussion of Special Procedures' reports of up to one hour per procedure, as is the current practice at the Third Committee of the U.N. General Assembly.          At each session there should be regular, focused and systematic deliberations on serious incidents or situations involving a failure or denial of cooperation by Governments with the Commission or its mechanisms.          The Commission should request the Office of the High Commissioner to submit annually a country-by-country compilation of information and recommendations from the Special Procedures for the previous twelve months, as well as a list of countries that CHR mechanisms have sought to visit. The report should include information on the implementation of Special Procedures' recommendations and follow up thereto.          For country‑specific mandates, the Commission's effectiveness and efficiency might be enhanced by establishing terms exceeding a single year, where appropriate, as is the case with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian Territories occupied since 1967.       International Standards  Since the last session of the Commission there have been important achievements in the development of new human rights standards. After many years, the Migrant Workers Convention finally came into force in December 2002, and the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture, adopted in draft by the Commission and General Assembly last year, was opened for signature in January 2003.   A number of other important standard setting exercises are currently underway. Good progress is being made by the working group on a draft legally binding instrument for the protection of all persons from enforced disappearance. It is important that the Commission continue to give high priority to this initiative and ensure that the momentum is maintained. Further, a draft Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights has undergone extensive consultation with governments. This new instrument would significantly strengthen the protection of economic, social and cultural rights by allowing the relevant treaty body to receive complaints and develop jurisprudence on critical economic, social and cultural rights issues.   Human Rights Watch joins with other NGOs in calling on the Commission to move this process into the next stage, by convening an open-ended working group to begin formal negotiations on the draft Optional Protocol.   The Death Penalty and Juvenile Offenders   Over the past three years, only the United States, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Pakistan, and Iran have imposed the death penalty on juvenile offenders, and the latter three countries have since repudiated the practice. In 2002, only three juvenile executions were known to have taken place in the world. All were in the U.S. state of Texas. Since 1990, the United States has put eighteen juvenile offenders to death, well over half the worldwide total. Outside the United States, a total of fourteen juvenile offenders were executed during the same period. The execution of juvenile offenders remains legal in twenty-two U.S. states, and seven states have actually carried out such death sentences in the past twenty-six years. Eighty-three juvenile offenders were on death row in fifteen states as of November 2002.   Death is an inhumane punishment, particularly for someone who was a child at the time of his or her crimes. Children are different from adults. They lack the experience, judgment, maturity, and restraint of an adult. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) expressly forbid capital punishment for offenders who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the offenses of which they were convicted. The prohibition on the execution of juvenile offenders is so widely observed that it has attained the status of a peremptory norm of international law, meaning that it is a binding obligation superior to other law. The United States is a state party to the ICCPR, although it purports to reserve the right to impose capital punishment on juvenile offenders. The U.N. Human Rights Committee has concluded that the U.S. reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty and therefore void as a matter of international law.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to address this issue in an omnibus children's resolution, a resolution on extrajudicial, arbitrary and summary executions, and any resolution on the death penalty. In particular, the CHR should:  Condemn the execution of juvenile offenders as a violation of human rights. Resolutions should state clearly that the imposition of the death penalty on persons who were under eighteen years old at the time of their crimes is expressly prohibited under international human rights law.          Urge those few countries that retain capital punishment for juvenile offenders to put an immediate end to the practice.       Special Envoy for the Abducted Children in Northern Uganda  Since the mid-1980s, a civil war in Northern Uganda has raged between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group based in northern Uganda, and the Ugandan government, with children being used as soldiers by both sides. The Government of Uganda has recruited children, often forcibly, to serve in the Ugandan People's Defense Forces (UPDF) and in Local Defense Units. The LRA has abducted an estimated 10,000-16,000 children from Northern Uganda.   The LRA's brutal tactics are notorious. Children abducted by the LRA are forced to rape and slaughter civilians, and abduct other children. Girls as young as twelve are given to rebel commanders as """"wives."""" Children who refuse to follow orders or try to escape are killed, typically by other children. An estimated 7,000 children have managed to escape, while many others have died from disease, maltreatment and war. In early 2002, estimates of the number of children still with the LRA ranged from several hundred to six thousand, but the true number is not known.   The plight of the abducted children in Northern Uganda has been repeatedly condemned by the international community and various initiatives have been taken unsuccessfully to secure the release of the abducted children. After fifteen years, decisive diplomatic action is needed.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to:  Request the Secretary-General to appoint a special envoy for the abducted children in Northern Uganda. The envoy should be an individual who is well known internationally and well respected. The envoy should conduct """"shuttle diplomacy"""" between the LRA and the Ugandan government with the aim of securing the release into safety of all those abducted by the LRA as children, and to seek an end to future abductions.          Urge governments to provide assistance through voluntary contributions to enable the Special Envoy to carry out his/her mandate.       Human Rights of Asylum Seekers and Refugees  Throughout the world, asylum seekers and refugees have been arbitrarily detained and sometimes subjected to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment in detention. Asylum seekers are often given inadequate access to legal representation and information pertaining to the refugee determination processes. In some situations, governments and inter-governmental agencies fail to adequately ensure the security of asylum seekers and refugees, particularly women and children. The rights of refugees to freedom of association and expression are also sometimes violated.   Asylum seekers and refugees, like all human beings, should not be subject to discrimination and should be treated equally before the law. However, governments have imposed entry policies, asylum determination procedures, and treatment in host countries that are discriminatory against refugees of particular nationalities or ethnicities. Discriminatory status determination procedures raise serious concerns about the rights of rejected asylum seekers, including the risk of their refoulement. Human Rights Watch has documented situations in which police have harassed specific ethnic groups or nationalities of asylum seekers and refugees, even when such individuals have permission to remain in a particular country. Government policies restricting access to social services and income support have curtailed the economic, social and cultural rights of refugees and asylum seekers.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution on the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees that:  Urges states to end the arbitrary arrest and detention of refugees and asylum seekers, including those rejected.          Recognizes that asylum seekers and refugees have a right to be protected from cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and calls on all governments to take all measures necessary to prevent such violations.          Recognizes the particular vulnerability of refugees and asylum seekers and their right to enjoy equality before the law and the equal protection of the law without discrimination in accordance with Article 26 of the ICCPR.          Reiterates that refugees have the right to engage in employment and to education, in accordance with the 1951 Refugee Convention, and that refugees have rights to freedom of movement, expression and assembly that are subject only to lawful limitations in accordance with the ICCPR.          Emphasizes the right of everyone to be free to leave any country, including his or her own as enshrined in Article 12 (2) of the ICCPR, as well as the right to seek and enjoy asylum as stated in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.          Reaffirms the duty of states to ensure the observance of the principle of non-refoulement recognized in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention, Article 7 of the ICCPR, and in Article 3 of the Convention against Torture.       China  Abuses against political dissidents, religious believers, labor activists, alleged """"separatists"""" in Xinjiang and Tibet, and North Korean asylum seekers, as well as the political use of psychiatric imprisonment have continued in China.   In March 2002, officials responded to worker protests in several northeastern cities with arrests, attacks on unarmed protestors, and threats to fire workers whose relatives were participating. Hundreds of Falungong members have been imprisoned and thousands sent without judicial review to reeducation-through-labor camps. In addition, the government closed Christian churches, Muslim mosques, and Tibetan monasteries which resisted state control, and arrested clergy and laity who refused to comply with government edicts. Chinese authorities have continued to increase restrictions on the internet that violate rights of free expression. Thousands of internet cafes have been closed; foreign search engines have been shut down or selectively blocked; and dozens of activists arrested or sentenced to terms as long as eleven years.   Implementation of the nationwide """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region, justified as a counter-terrorism measure, resulted in summary trials and mass sentencing rallies as officials proceeded with """"quick arrest,"""" and """"quick proceedings"""" against ethnic Uighurs. There have been credible reports of the extensive use of torture and the death penalty in the course of the campaign.   The legal rights of defendants are routinely compromised by police officials, prosecutors, and judges. Defendants are denied timely access to counsel and to counsel of their own choosing; defense counsel's ability to gather and present evidence is severely limited in both the pre-trial period and during the trial itself; and although torture is officially prohibited, evidence obtained during torture is permitted at trial. Cases in point are those of Lobsang Dhondrup, reported to already have been executed, and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a prominent Tibetan spiritual leader sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, in connection with a series of bombings.   Despite its obligations as a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention, China has forcibly repatriated North Korean asylum seekers although they may be severely punished upon their return home.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution on China that would:  Condemn China's grave human rights abuses.          Urge the Chinese authorities to revise the Law on Protecting State Secrets to bring the scope of information deemed secret in line with international human rights standards; amend China's constitution so that freedom of belief encompasses manifestation of that belief """"in worship, observance, practice and teaching;"""" rescind the requirement that to be legal, a congregation must be vetted and registered; permit foreign and domestic legal observers to attend all trials as provided for under international human rights standards; revise the Criminal Procedure Code.          Urge China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which it signed in October 1998.          Call upon China to honor its refugee commitments.          Urge China to cooperate with U.N. human rights mechanisms (which should pay special attention to the situation of Uighurs in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region).       Colombia  Colombia's internal war has intensified over the past year following the collapse of peace talks in February 2002. Paramilitary groups allied within the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia commit massacres, selective killings, and death threats. These groups operate with the tolerance and often support of units within Colombia's military. Attacks against human rights defenders remain common, especially in rural areas. In 2002, sixteen defenders were reported killed, most by groups that were not clearly identified at the time of writing. Those responsible for previous attacks remain largely unpunished and impunity for human rights crimes increased markedly as Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio, who took office in mid-2001, undermined or derailed key ongoing prosecutions. His hostility to human rights investigations was evidenced by his purge of prosecutors and investigators willing to pursue such cases. In April 2002, seven prosecutors with the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit and one member of the Technical Investigations Unit received threats related to their investigations of high-profile cases of human rights violations.   The guerrilla movement, known as FARC-EP, escalated attacks on civilians, among them hundreds of mayors and other local officials. FARC-EP were responsible for numerous killings, including a May 1 attack in which 119 displaced persons, including at least forty-eight children, were killed when a gas cylinder bomb hit a church in which they had sought shelter. Guerrillas also sought to influence politics and raise money via kidnapping.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Deplore Colombia's failure to implement recommendations made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights; call on Colombia to improve its record of implementation; and request the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a report on follow-up.          Call for an increase in the number of permanent staff of the Office of the High Commissioner in Colombia.          Request the High Commissioner to renegotiate the mandate of his Office in Colombia to include the power to transmit information on cases to international and nongovernmental organizations and the press as appropriate, and to release statements summarizing its investigations on a case-by-case basis.          Recommend that U.N. thematic mechanisms visit Colombia to investigate, in particular, the administration of justice, forced disappearances, and violence against indigenous and ethnic groups, in particular Afro-Colombians.       Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)  The closed nature of the DPRK and the lack of access by private human rights organizations and U.N. human rights experts is a major obstacle to monitoring abuses and promoting improvements. However, Human Rights Watch has conducted research with North Korean refugees who have fled to China, and now reside in Seoul. We collected testimony on horrific conditions and treatment in labor camps and prisons in the DPRK, which we have corroborated with information from other sources. In a report on North Korean refugees published in November 2002, HRW documented serious abuses including: arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of citizens based on family background; torture and cruel and degrading treatment of detainees in labor training camps, provincial concentration centers, and political prison camps known as administrative camps; and the use of forced labor.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Express grave concern about serious abuses of human rights in the DPRK, and press the DPRK to fully implement the recommendations of the U.N. Human Rights Committee.          Call on the DPRK government to provide complete and unrestricted access to the U.N. special rapporteurs and working groups on arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, religious freedom, violence against women, and the independence of judges and lawyers.          Call on the DPRK government to provide the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights access to citizens who have left the country and been forcibly returned in order to determine their safety, treatment and welfare.       The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)  Even though there was significant diplomatic progress towards a peaceful settlement of the DRC war, throughout 2002 hundreds of civilians were killed by different armed groups. In May 2002, RCD-Goma forces killed at least 80 people in Kisangani in response to a short-lived mutiny. In the second half of 2002, armed groups fighting for control over Ituri province and adjacent parts of North Kivu killed hundreds of civilians. Combatants continued to submit women and girls to horrific acts of sexual violence. Government forces and armed groups in eastern DRC continue to recruit and use children as soldiers. In many cases, the fighting was motivated by a brutal quest for natural resources such as timber, diamonds, gold, coltan and other minerals. The war in DRC has sparked a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic dimensions. Over two million people are currently displaced in eastern DRC, often without any access to humanitarian aid, and their numbers are rising. Human rights defenders, whether in government or rebel-held areas, were frequently targeted for their peaceful investigative and public activities. The justice system has collapsed.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Condemn war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in eastern DRC, specifically Ituri, North and South Kivu, and call on all warring parties to stop targeting civilians through killings, sexual violence, child recruitment, and other unlawful acts.          Urge the U.N. Security Council to ensure that the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), """"protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence.""""          Call upon the DRC government to comply fully with its human rights obligations; in particular, to bring perpetrators of abuses to justice, to allow human rights defenders and government critics to speak out freely, to disband the Military Order Court and to reinstate the moratorium on executions.          Renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the DRC and provide her with the necessary resources for meaningful interventions.          Strengthen the Field Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the DRC.          Call upon the DRC government and all Congolese and foreign actors to ensure that perpetrators of abuses, including foreign nationals on all sides, are held accountable.          Urge the U.N. Security Council to establish a U.N. Commission of Experts to determine responsibility for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the DRC since 1993.       Iran  Since the last session of the Commission, the Iranian government has issued a standing invitation to U.N. Special Procedures and established human rights dialogues with the European Union and other countries. Despite these welcome developments, the human rights situation remains grave and warrants continued scrutiny by the Commission.   The political standoff between reformists, in control of the directly elected elements of the government, and the conservatives who exercise authority through the office of the Leader, the Judiciary and the armed forces, continues to hamper human rights progress. Patently unfair trials of political opposition members, incommunicado detention and coercion into making incriminatory statements, as well as extremely poor detention conditions for several elderly prisoners have been a particular cause of concern.   Several writers and journalists remain in prison solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. The judiciary has confirmed the sentences of several lawyers associated with reformist causes, including cases relating to the assassinations of writers and intellectuals in 1998. One lawyer was sentenced to five years in prison and fifty lashes after he probed the involvement of Ministry of Intelligence officials in the 1998 murders. A Revolutionary Court in Hamedan sentenced a prominent academic to death for alleged blasphemy and insulting the clergy. The head of the National Institute for Opinion Polls is awaiting his imprisonment sentence after publishing a poll showing a majority of Iranians favor restoring relations with the United States. The heads of the private research institutes that conducted the poll have received eight and nine years imprisonment respectively, charged with """"collaboration with U.S. elements and British intelligence"""" and with conducting """"psychological warfare"""" against the government.   The lack of public school education in the Kurdish language remains a perennial source of Kurdish frustration. Followers of the Baha'i faith also continue to face persecution, including being denied permission to worship or to carry out other communal affairs publicly. At least four Baha'is are serving prison terms for their religious beliefs.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Re-establish a special mechanism to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Iran.          Call on Iranian authorities to facilitate visits by the U.N. Special Rapporteurs on violence against women, torture, and freedom of religion; and make public and time-based commitments to full implementation of the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, and other Special Rapporteurs' recommendations.          Call on the government to ratify the CEDAW, CAT and the ICC treaties, and announce an official review of reservations entered upon ratification of other major human rights instruments.          Call on the government to release all political prisoners; abolish of the death penalty for juvenile offenders as a first step towards total abolition of the death penalty; amend the press law to safeguard freedom of the press; establish and enforce strict limits on incommunicado detention, and ensure prompt access to lawyers and family members for detainees.       Israel/Occupied Territories  Civilians continue to bear the brunt of repeated, egregious violations of international humanitarian law by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups. At least 1,985 Palestinians and 720 Israelis were killed between September 2000 and January 2003, the majority civilians, including more than 300 Palestinian and 80 Israeli children.   The number and gravity of violations committed by the IDF escalated as clashes culminated in the military reoccupation of most areas of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israeli soldiers repeatedly used indiscriminate and excessive force, killed civilians willfully and unlawfully, and used Palestinian civilians as human shields. The IDF continued to fail to investigate wrongful deaths or other violations by Israeli soldiers, and as of January 2003, had not responded to repeated requests from Human Rights Watch for information on killings the organization documented in Jenin.   Armed Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians—suicide bombings and other deliberate attacks—also reached unprecedented levels. PA officials condemned such attacks, but failed to move decisively against those responsible for ordering and organizing them. Armed Palestinians also killed at least twenty-two alleged collaborators.   Extensive IDF damage to civilian buildings and infrastructure, including the partial or complete destruction of roads, sewage networks, water supplies, and electrical grids, appeared to exceed any requirement of military necessity in urban areas such as Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah. The IDF also destroyed hundreds of houses, primarily in Gaza, on alleged security grounds in excess of military necessity. Israeli forces also demolished homes of families of alleged suicide bombers or armed militants.   Israeli curfews and restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were so severe and widespread as to constitute collective punishment. Israeli authorities also restricted and harassed humanitarian agencies responsible for providing food, medication, and other essential goods and services in the West Bank and Gaza.   Israeli authorities continued to confiscate Palestinian lands to expand illegal Israeli settlements and bypass roads. Israeli authorities rarely prevented, halted, or punished settlers for attacks against Palestinian civilians and their property.   Thousands of Palestinian civilians, including children, were arrested throughout the year. Reports of ill-treatment were widespread, including kicking, beating, squalid conditions, deprivation of food and drink, and even gradual reversion to the use of torture. As of January 2003, some 5,100 Palestinians were being held on security-related grounds - the highest level in over a decade. More than one thousand of them are held in administrative detention without charge - an increase from twenty-seven such detainees held in October 2001.   Human Rights Watch urges the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Condemn systematic and grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by all parties to the conflict;          Urge the United Nations Security Council to authorize the establishment of an international observer mission to monitor and report on continuing human rights and international humanitarian law violations in the West Bank and Gaza.          Incorporate the text and standards contained in the December 2001 Declaration of the reconvened conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention;          Call on Israel to conduct impartial investigations into all suspicious killings by members of its security forces, make the results public, and to discipline or punish individuals found guilty of wrongdoing;          Call on the Palestinian Authority to arrest and bring to justice in accordance with international standards those responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians.       Russian Federation/Chechnya   During sweep operations in Chechnya, Russian forces rounded up thousands of men, looted homes, physically abused villagers, and in some cases committed extrajudicial executions. Those detained face beatings and other forms of torture, aimed at coercing information or confessions about Chechen forces. Federal forces routinely extort money from detainees' relatives as a condition for release, and also require detainees upon release to sign statements that their treatment in custody was adequate. In hundreds of cases those last seen in the custody of Russian forces """"disappear,"""" never to be seen again by their relatives.   Since last year's Commission, Russian authorities have put undue pressure on displaced persons to return to Chechnya where they remain at risk. In June authorities cut off electricity, gas and rations in smaller settlements for IDPs in Ingushetia in an attempt to pressure them to return to Chechnya.   Russia continued to resist establishing any meaningful accountability process for crimes committed by its forces. Although the procuracy opened hundreds of criminal investigations into abuses by Russian troops, in most cases officials failed to conduct even the most basic investigative steps (including questioning eyewitnesses and relatives). As a result, most investigations remained unsolved and almost none made it to the courts. The only trial of a high-ranking officer, Yuri Budanov, charged with the March 2000 murder of Kheda Kungaeva, an eighteen-year-old Chechen woman, ended in acquittal on the grounds of temporary insanity.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Condemn ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law by both parties to the conflict.          Insist on accountability by: calling on the Russian authorities to ensure meaningful investigations into all reported crimes by Russian troops against civilians in Chechnya or Ingushetia; calling on the Russian authorities to publish a detailed list of all current and past investigations into such abuses and indicate their current status; renewing the call for a national commission of inquiry to document abuses by both sides to the conflict; and making clear that continued failure on the part of Russian authorities to make progress on accountability will result in the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to document abuses and produce an official record of them.          Call on Russia to desist from coerced returns of internally displaced persons and to ensure their well-being.          Call for visits to the region by key U.N. thematic mechanisms, as required by the previous CHR resolutions.          Call for renewal of the OSCE Assistance Group's mandate.       Sudan  Human Rights Watch has followed in detail the armed conflict and human rights abuses in Sudan for many years. Our research shows that the Sudanese government has targeted and bombed civilians and civilian objects, including relief distribution locations, churches, and schools, causing many civilian casualties and damage to the fragile civilian infrastructure of the south.   In the cities of the north, far from any armed conflict, a state of emergency has remained in place for three years. The government has continued to impose tight controls on political activity through a pervasive web of laws and security forces. Security forces break up demonstrations and meetings, arbitrarily detain human rights advocates and political activists, including students, and hold them without trial, sometimes torturing them. An executive decree has kept the leading Islamist political opponent in prolonged arbitrary detention for two years, with no charges pending against him.   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) engaged in abuses against southern populations, on at least two occasions in 2002 killing or abducting scores of civilians in two villages, Tuhubak and Todaj. It has often impeded the rights of assembly and expression of persons living in SPLM-controlled areas. During its capture of Torit in August 2002, the SPLM/A reportedly summarily executed scores of captured government soldiers or combatants.   Human Rights Watch calls on the CHR to adopt a resolution that would:  Renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights for Sudan.          Condemn the gross abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Sudanese government.          Call on the Sudanese government to end impunity and ensure accountability for gross abuses of human rights.          Call on the Sudanese government to lift the state of emergency in non-conflict areas, and rescind the laws granting impunity and extensive powers on the security forces.          Condemn the gross abuses of humanitarian law by the SPLM/A and call on it to investigate and hold accountable those responsible. The resolution should also call on the SPLM/A to respect the civil and political rights of persons living in the territories it controls.       Turkmenistan  The Turkmen government tolerates no opposition and crushes critical thinking. There are no free and fair elections and Saparmurat Niazov is president for life. Turkmen opposition figures were either driven into exile in the early 1990s or imprisoned. Most were released, and after the awful prison experience and constant surveillance afterward do not dare speak out again. No independent human rights organizations can operate in Turkmenistan. There is no free media: the government subjects all newspaper outlets to prepublication censorship, has banned most Russian-language media, and has introduced measures to limit access to the Internet. The opera, ballet, circus, the philharmonic orchestra, and non-Turkmen cultural associations are banned and the Academy of Sciences has been closed. Followers of faiths other than Russian orthodoxy and Sunni Islam have faced criminal prosecution, police beatings, deportation, and in some cases demolition of their houses of worship.   On November 25, 2002, unknown gunmen opened fire on President Niazov's motorcade, injuring several people. The president was unharmed. Government officials claim that sixty-seven people have been arrested, though the figure is believed to be much higher. Many are relatives of the exiled political opposition. Reliable sources report that some have suffered torture and ill-treatment in custody. To date fifty-eight people have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five years to life imprisonment in relation to the assassination attempt, and more await trial. There is reason to fear that they and their families have been subjected to ill treatment as well as intimidation in order to compel confessions and testimony. A broadcast on national television of a """"confession"""" by a former politician —which was visibly forced—conjured the image of the show trials of the Stalin era.   To date, the Turkmen government has not cooperated with the U.N. human rights system, although it has ratified the ICCPR, the ICESCR, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and other major human rights treaties. It has not filed a single report to U.N. treaty bodies.   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission to adopt a resolution that would:  Express grave concern about serious abuses of human rights in Turkmenistan, and press the Turkmen government to undertake systemic reforms to fully comply with its international human rights obligations.          Call on the government to ensure fair and open trials for all those charged in relation to the November 25 assassination attempt, and to guarantee due process to all those detained; to retry those already convicted in full compliance with international standards and release them prior to trial, and to allow international monitoring of all trials in order to promote transparency.          Call on the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the U.N. thematic mechanisms to request invitations to visit Turkmenistan. The High Commissioner should be asked to report on his trip to the 60th session of the Commission. Should the Turkmen government fail to issue an invitation, the High Commissioner should be asked to report to the Commission using information gathered by a UNDP mission and other sources.       Thank you in advance for your attention to these important issues. We look forward to working with you throughout the 59th Session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.   With kind regards,   Sincerely,   Joanna Weschler Loubna Freih U.N.

Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution on the protection of human rights in countering terrorism that would emphasize the importance of the respect for international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law in combating terrorism; request relevant mechanisms and bodies of the United Nations to monitor counter terrorism measures; ask the High Commissioner to continue his leadership role in coordinating and encouraging the work of all relevant U.N. bodies and organs on matters related to terrorism and human rights, and ask him to create a dedicated unit within his office to support these activities; and ask the Secretary General to appoint a Special Representative on human rights and counter-terrorism who would examine the effect of counter terrorism measures on human rights in specific countries.   Background  Counter-terrorism measures have affected human rights in countries East and West, North and South. The Secretary-General has raised his concerns repeatedly, both at the Security Council and at the Commission, saying that there must be no trade-off between human rights and fighting terrorism. The High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sergio Vieira de Mello, has raised the issue several times, including when addressing the Counter Terrorism Committee in New York, and is following up on a study initiated by Mary Robinson of the human rights impact of the new security legislation.   The General Assembly during its 57th session unanimously passed a resolution, sponsored by Mexico, reaffirming the importance of respecting human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in combating terrorism (A/RES/57/219). During its 59th session, the Commission on Human Rights will be receiving a report from the Secretary-General on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism. It will be incumbent on the Commission to take action on this issue.   Recommendations  Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution on the protection of human rights in countering terrorism that would:  Emphasize the importance of the respect for international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law in combating terrorism.          Ask the High Commissioner to continue his leadership role in coordinating and encouraging the work of all relevant U.N. bodies and organs on matters related to terrorism and human rights; to make recommendations on safeguarding human rights in combating terrorism; and to seek, receive and exchange information from all relevant sources, including governments, international and non-governmental organizations for these purposes.          Ask the High Commissioner to create a dedicated unit within his office to support this work on human rights and counter terrorism.          Request relevant CHR special procedures and the U.N. treaty bodies to monitor counter terrorism measures adopted and implemented by member states.          Ask the Secretary General to appoint a Special Representative on Human Rights and Counter-Terrorism to examine the effect of counter terrorism measures, law and practices on human rights in countries worldwide; examine the compatibility of these measures, laws and practices with international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law; and make specific and timely recommendations to states on safeguarding human rights while combating terrorism.","","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-special-envoy-abducted-children-n","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the Special Envoy for the Abducted Children in N Uganda","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on the Special Envoy for the Abducted Children in N. Uganda","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to request the Secretary- General to appoint a special envoy for Northern Uganda with a mandate to work for the release into safety of children abducted by the Lord's Resistance Army. We urge the Commission to make this request through its resolution on the abduction of children from Northern Uganda (most recently E/CN.4/Res/2002/53).   Background   Since the mid-1980s, a civil war in Northern Uganda has raged between the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group, and the Ugandan government. Over the course of the conflict, child soldiers have been used by both sides. The Government of Uganda has recruited children, often forcibly, to serve in the Ugandan People's Defence Forces (UPDF) and in Local Defence Units. The LRA has abducted an estimated 10,000-16,000 children from Northern Uganda. It is believed that eighty-five percent of the LRA's forces were abducted as children.   The LRA's brutal tactics have become well known. Children abducted by the LRA are forced to fight against the UPDF, raid villages for food, destroy property, rape and slaughter civilians, and abduct other children. Girls as young as twelve are given to rebel commanders as """"wives."""" Children who refuse to follow orders or try to escape are killed, typically by other children who are forced to beat or hack the victim or be killed themselves.   The current number of children with the LRA is unknown. An estimated 7,000 children have managed to escape, while many others have died from disease, maltreatment and war. In early 2002, estimates of the number of children still with the LRA ranged from several hundred to six thousand.   In March 2002, the UPDF launched a military offensive against the LRA, """"Operation Iron Fist,"""" sending troops into southern Sudan with the permission of the Sudanese government. While based in Sudan, and after the Sudanese government cut off most support for the LRA in 2001, the LRA committed numerous abuses-looting, killing, kidnapping, burning-against southern Sudanese. There are an unknown number of Sudanese children who have been abducted by the LRA from inside Sudan and from Sudanese refugee camps in Uganda.   Operation Iron Fist has not disbanded the LRA as intended, but driven the LRA back into Uganda. A result has been a significant increase in the number of attacks against civilians and the number of children abducted in Northern Uganda. Gulu Support the Children Organization (GUSCO), a local NGO providing rehabilitation assistance to formerly abducted children, recently estimated that at least 4,000 children have been abducted since June of 2002. The World Food Program estimates that approximately twenty children are abducted every day.   The plight of the abducted children in Northern Uganda has been well known since the mid-1990's and has been repeatedly condemned by the international community. Various initiatives have been taken to try to end the conflict and secure the release of the abducted children. The Sudanese government has reduced (and perhaps cut off) assistance to the LRA as a result of intense international and U.S. pressure. Civil society leaders in northern Uganda, most prominently the """"Acholi Religious Leaders Peace Initiative,"""" have called for a peaceful solution to the conflict through negotiations and been in direct contact with the LRA. The Ugandan government adopted an amnesty law to encourage members of the LRA to give up their arms.   None of these efforts have been successful, however. Higher-level LRA fighters have not deserted, possibly because the amnesty law has not been effectively implemented. The continuation of """"Operation Iron Fist"""" has undermined peace efforts, contributing to a humanitarian crisis and exacerbating the rate of abductions and other atrocities against civilians.   The abduction of children in Northern Uganda has continued now for over fifteen years, destroying the lives of thousands of children and their families. The LRA's attacks have spread, including killings and kidnappings in new areas of Uganda, outside of the Acholi homeland. Decisive diplomatic action is needed to bring the abductions to a halt and secure the release of the thousands of children in LRA captivity.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Request that the Secretary-General appoint a special envoy for the abducted children in Northern Uganda. The envoy should be an individual who is well known internationally and well respected.  The envoy should be encouraged to conduct """"shuttle diplomacy"""" between the LRA and the Ugandan government with the aim of securing the release into safety of all those abducted by the LRA as children, and to seek an end to future abductions. He or she should consult intensively with religious and other civilian leaders in Northern Uganda, as well as with NGOs and U.N. agencies that have been involved in the situation.  Governments should be urged to provide assistance through voluntary contributions to enable the Special Envoy to carry out his/her mandate.","Africa, Uganda","Children's Rights, United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-turkmenistan","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Turkmenistan","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Turkmenistan","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a strong resolution condemning human rights violations by the government of Turkmenistan. The resolution should also request the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the country and call on the Turkmen government to issue invitations to U.N. thematic mechanisms.   Background  The government of Turkmenistan is one of the most repressive in the world. Saparmurat Niazov is president for life. The government tolerates no opposition and crushes critical thinking. Since its independence from the Soviet Union, there has not been a single nationwide election that could be considered free or fair. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe declined to send even a scaled-down mission to monitor the 2000 parliamentary elections in Turkmenistan, so certain was it that they were an empty exercise.   Turkmen opposition figures were either driven into exile in the early 1990s or imprisoned. Most were released, and after the awful prison experience and constant surveillance afterward do not dare speak out again. No independent human rights organizations can operate in Turkmenistan. There is no free media: the government subjects all newspaper outlets to prepublication censorship, has banned most Russian-language media, and has introduced measures to limit access to the Internet.   In the name of building the Turkmen nation, the government has also banned opera, ballet, circus, the philharmonic orchestra, and non-Turkmen cultural associations. It has also closed the Academy of Sciences. Russian orthodoxy and government-approved Sunni Islam are the only religions that may operate houses of worship. Followers of other faiths have faced criminal prosecution, police beatings, deportation, and in some cases demolition of their houses of worship.   The consequences of the November 25 assassination attempt  On November 25, 2002, unknown gunmen opened fire on President Niazov's motorcade, injuring several people. The president was unharmed. Government officials claim that sixty-seven people have been arrested, though many believe the figure to be much higher. Many are relatives of the exiled political opposition. Reliable sources report that some have suffered torture and ill-treatment in custody. Relatives who have not been arrested have been threatened with arrest and subjected to relentless harassment and surveillance. There is little doubt that the intent is to pressure exiles to return, and to compel those in custody to confess or give testimony.   Former foreign minister Boris Shikhmuradov and other former politicians were arrested on December 26, 2002 in relation to the assassination attempt. Their televised """"confessions"""" were no doubt secured under the duress of these threats to their families. Broadcast on national television, their confessions-which were visibly forced-conjured the image of the show trials of the Stalin era. To date fifty-eight people have been sentenced to prison terms ranging from five years to life imprisonment in relation to the assassination attempt, and more await trial. There is reason to fear that they and their families have been subjected to ill treatment as well as intimidation in order to compel confessions and testimony. Throughout the past decade the rule of law has been so thoroughly degraded in Turkmenistan that an effective investigation-ensuring due process rights-and fair trial of the perpetrators of the November 25 assassination attempt are highly unlikely. In the past the Turkmen authorities have tortured dissidents and sentenced them to long prison terms. The judiciary, like all other government agencies, is entirely dependent on the president. The Council of Ministers has the exclusive right to issue arrest warrants.   One of the victims of the post-assassination crackdown is a courageous environmental activist, Farid Tukhbatullin, who has nothing to do with opposition politics. Arrested on December 22, he stands charged of illegally crossing the Uzbek-Turkmen border and of concealing a crime. The latter charge relates to an international conference Tukhbatullin attended on human rights in Turkmenistan, held in Russia, at which authorities wrongly claim that participants discussed Shikhmuradov's intent to violently overthrow the government. Both charges are pretexts intended to intimidate nongovernmental civic activists.   Failure to cooperate with the United Nations  To date, the Turkmen government has not cooperated with the U.N. human rights system, although it has ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and other major human rights treaties. It has not filed a single report to U.N. treaty bodies. It has failed to respond to a request made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights for an invitation for a technical assessment mission.   Recommendations  The Commission should adopt a resolution that deplores the abuses perpetrated by the Turkmen government. The resolution should call for the Turkmen government to:  Express grave concern about serious abuses of human rights in Turkmenistan, and press the Turkmen government to undertake systemic reforms to fully comply with its international human rights obligations.  Ensure fair and open trials for all those charged in relation to the November 25 assassination attempt, and the guarantee of due process to all those detained; retry those already convicted in full compliance with international standards and release them prior to trial.  Ensure international monitoring of all trials in order to promote transparency.  Issue an invitation to the High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit the country. The resolution should call on the High Commissioner and the thematic mechanisms to request invitations to visit Turkmenistan. The High Commissioner should be asked to report on his trip to the 60th session of the Commission. Should the Turkmen government fail to issue an invitation, the High Commissioner should be asked to report to the Commission using information gathered by a UNDP mission and other sources.","Europe/Central Asia, Turkmenistan","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-sudan","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Sudan","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Sudan","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights for Sudan, and condemn gross abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law by the Sudanese government and rebel Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) forces in the twenty-year Sudan conflict.   Background  Human Rights Watch has followed in detail the armed conflict and human rights abuses in Sudan for many years. Our research shows that the Sudanese government has targeted and bombed civilians and civilian objects, including relief distribution locations, churches, and schools, causing many civilian casualties and damage to the fragile civilian infrastructure of the south. Together with the Sudanese army, the Sudanese government-sponsored ethnic militias have engaged in scorched earth campaigns against Nuer civilians in the oilfields of Western Upper Nile/Unity State in which thousands have been forcibly displaced and scores of civilians (primarily the weak, elderly, women, and children) have been killed, and many women raped. Conspicuously, the government has not captured any combatants during the twenty-year civil war in which some two million civilians have died, leading to the conclusion that it has a policy of summary execution of captured and wounded combatants.   In the cities of the north, far from any armed conflict, a state of emergency has remained in place for three years. The government has continued to impose tight controls on political activity through a pervasive web of laws and security forces. Security forces break up demonstrations and meetings, arbitrarily detain human rights advocates and political activists, including students, and hold them without trial, sometimes torturing them. An executive decree has kept the leading Islamist political opponent in prolonged arbitrary detention for two years, with no charges pending against him.   The SPLM/A engaged in abuses against southern populations, on at least two occasions in 2002 killing or abducting scores of civilians in two villages, Tuhubak and Todaj. It has often impeded the rights of assembly and expression of persons living in SPLM-controlled areas. During its capture of Torit in August 2002, the SPLM/A reportedly summarily executed scores of captured government soldier combatants.   The Sudanese government and the SPLM/A have been engaged since June 2002 in peace talks under the sponsorship of the regional InterGovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), headed by Kenya, and mediated by the United States, the United Kingdom, and Norway, among many other international actors backing peace in Sudan. The parties agreed to an initial protocol resolving issues of religion and state and self-determination on July 20, 2002, and in mid-October agreed on a ceasefire during negotiations and until March 31, 2003, and also on free humanitarian access through December 31, 2002. However, fighting had broken out in Western Upper Nile/Unity State as of early January 2003.   The mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights in Sudan  The report of the Special Rapporteur to the General Assembly on November 4, 2002, concluded that overall the human rights situation in Sudan had not yet changed significantly. As to human rights conditions in the government-controlled areas far from the war, he noted that the Criminal Procedure Act of 1991 and the National Security Forces Act were amended to give additional powers to the security forces, """"the main responsible for the occurrence of human rights abuses as well as impunity of security officers."""" He recommended that the state of emergency and these amendments should be lifted, but this has not occurred. As long as such a repressive structure remains in place, arbitrary detention and torture continue as they do, and impunity is the norm for the security forces, Sudan will continue to need the scrutiny of a Special Rapporteur. It is particularly important for the Special Rapporteur to continue his work alongside the peace negotiations to ensure that human rights are addressed adequately in the process.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on human rights for Sudan.  Condemn the gross abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law by the Sudanese government.  Call on the Sudanese government to end impunity and ensure accountability for gross abuses of human rights, by conducting thorough investigations of all violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and prosecuting those responsible. Call on the Sudanese government to lift the state of emergency in non-conflict areas, and rescind the laws granting impunity and extensive powers on the security forces.  Condemn the gross abuses of international humanitarian law by the SPLM/A and call on it to investigate and hold accountable those responsible. Call on the SPLM/A to respect the human rights of persons living in its territories.","Africa, Sudan","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-russian-federation/chechnya","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Russian Federation-Chechnya","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Russian Federation/Chechnya","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a strong resolution on the conflict in Chechnya, condemning ongoing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by both parties to the conflict; urging the Russian authorities to establish a genuine accountability process for these abuses; calling on Russia to desist from coerced returns of internally displaced persons and to ensure their well-being; calling for visits to the region by key U.N. thematic mechanisms, in particular the Special Rapporteurs on torture and on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions; and urging Russia to renew the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Assistance Group's mandate.   Background  Human Rights Watch continues to monitor the conduct of the Chechnya conflict, now entering its fourth year, through periodic field missions. In December 2002 we conducted a mission to Ingushetia to research continuing abuses inside Chechnya and the precarious position of displaced persons.   As in previous years, Russian forces in dozens of sweep operations have rounded up thousands of men, looted homes, physically abused villagers, and in some cases committed extrajudicial executions. Those detained face beatings and other forms of torture, aimed at coercing information or confessions about Chechen forces. Federal forces routinely extort money from detainees' relatives as a condition for release, and also require detainees upon release to sign statements that their treatment in custody was adequate.   In hundreds of cases those last seen in the custody of Russian forces """"disappear,"""" never to be seen again by their relatives. In 2001 and 2002 Human Rights Watch published two reports documenting more than two hundred forced disappearances, and our current research indicates that they continue unabated.   Russian forces continue to commit extrajudical executions. The November 2002 murder of Malika Umazheva, the former head of administration for the village of Alkhan-Kala, by Russian forces appeared to be a clear act of retribution for her outspoken criticism of the conduct of those forces.   In the wake of the hostage-taking in a Moscow theater in October 2002, the situation in Chechnya grew even more tense as Russian troops stepped up their operations. For example, during an October sweep in Chechen-Aul Russian soldiers detained eight men, two of whom were later released. Eighteen days later, villagers found the mutilated corpses of five of the men. One man remains missing. Twice in 2002 the authorities ordered military and security forces to take steps to curb abuse by making the operations more transparent, but our research has shown the orders are routinely ignored.   IDP crisis  Since last year's Commission, Russian authorities have put undue pressure on displaced persons to return to Chechnya where they remain at risk. In June authorities cut off electricity, gas and rations in smaller settlements for IDPs in Ingushetia in an attempt to pressure them to return to Chechnya. In July and December officials closed two tent camps housing displaced persons from Chechnya-one in northern Chechnya, in an area generally safe from human rights violations, the other in Ingushetia-and have vowed to close all such camps in Ingushetia by spring 2003.   The Russian government claims that all returns to Chechnya are strictly voluntary, and points to offers it makes to tent dwellers of alternative housing in Ingushetia. But alternative shelters inspected by Human Rights Watch in December 2002 have proved either nonexistent or uninhabitable. The combination of incentives and pressure on displaced persons to return to Chechnya belies the claim of voluntary return. Moreover, because migration officials deny the ongoing human rights crisis in Chechnya, they do not acknowledge security concerns as a legitimate impediment to return. While the Russian government considers the security situation in Chechnya good enough for the return of the IDPs, it cited security concerns to cancel a scheduled October 2002 visit by the Representative of the U.N. Secretary-General on internally displaced persons to Chechnya.   Abuses by Chechen fighters  Chechen rebels staged a mass hostage taking at a Moscow theater in October, threatening to kill all 700 hostages if Russia refused to withdraw its troops from Chechnya. In the three days before Russian special forces launched their rescue operation, the rebels killed several hostages. Rebel fighters were also thought to be responsible for dozens of assassinations of civil servants and others who cooperated with the Moscow-appointed administration of Chechnya. Mines laid by rebel fighters on roads claimed the lives of federal soldiers and also of numerous civilians.   Accountability  Russia continued to resist establishing any meaningful accountability process for crimes committed by its forces. Although the procuracy opened hundreds of criminal investigations into abuses by Russian troops, in most cases officials failed to conduct even the most basic investigative steps (including questioning eyewitnesses and relatives). As a result, most investigations remained unsolved and almost none made it to the courts. In an unprecedented disclosure about how such investigations are conducted, the Russian government informed the European Court of Human Rights of steps taken to investigate the December 2000 """"disappearance"""" of Said-Khussein Imakaev, whose parents had filed an application about his disappearance to the court. Investigators questioned two individuals, one of whom was his mother, and wrote three letters to police and security officials requesting information about the case. When the latter replied that they had no information, officials suspended the investigation.   The only trial of a high-ranking officer, Yuri Budanov, ended in acquittal after two controversial forensic psychiatric assessments found that Budanov had been temporarily insane at the time of the murder. Budanov was charged with the March 2000 murder of Kheda Kungaeva, an eighteen-year-old Chechen woman. Two earlier psychiatric assessments conducted immediately after Budanov's arrest in March 2000 had found he was sane at the time of the murder.   Access  Although the OSCE and the Council of Europe maintained monitors in the region throughout 2002, Russia has sought to downplay or remove altogether their human rights mandates. Russia's insistence that the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya limit its 2003 activities to humanitarian issues resulted in the technical closure of the group's office in Znamenskoe when its mandate expired on December 31, 2002. In the three years of the conflict, Russia has not complied with U.N. resolutions calling for deployment of U.N. thematic mechanisms, with the exception of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on children in armed conflict. Russian authorities cancelled a visit by the Special Rapporteur on violence against women and the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons, citing security conditions. Despite three years of calls, they have failed to issue invitations to the Special Rapporteur on torture and the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, and arbitrary executions.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Condemn ongoing violations of human rights and humanitarian law by both parties to the conflict. The resolution should call on the Russian authorities to immediately put an end to arbitrary detention and to observe international and Russian legal standards; to end the use of torture and ill-treatment; to put an end to the pattern of enforced disappearances; and to end extrajudicial executions. It should call on Chechen rebel leaders to hand over fighters who were involved in planning the hostage taking in Moscow to competent law enforcement officials in Russia or elsewhere so that they can be brought to justice; and to stop assassinating Chechen civilians who cooperate with the Russian authorities.  Insist on accountability. The resolution should call on the Russian authorities to ensure meaningful investigations into all reported crimes by Russian troops against civilians in Chechnya or Ingushetia, and for the prosecution of the perpetrators; it should call on the Russian authorities to publish a detailed list of all current and past investigations into such abuses and indicate their current status; it should renew its call for a national commission of inquiry to document abuses by both sides to the conflict; and make clear that continued failure on the part of Russian authorities to make progress on accountability will result in the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to document abuses and produce an official record of them.  Call on Russia to desist from coerced returns of internally displaced persons and to ensure their well-being. The resolution should strongly condemn Russia's efforts to force internally displaced persons to return to Chechnya. It should call on the Russian authorities to stop moving any displaced persons to parts of the conflict zone where their safety and security cannot be guaranteed and where international humanitarian agencies do not have free and safe access.  Call for visits to the region by key U.N. thematic mechanisms. The resolution should renew calls for visits by the Special Rapporteur on torture, the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, and the Representative of the Secretary-General on internally displaced persons.  Call for renewal of the OSCE Assistance Group's mandate, as required by the previous CHR resolutions. The resolution should call on the Russian government to agree to the renewal of the Assistance Group's mandate that expired on December 31, 2002.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","United Nations"

The resolution should call on the DPRK to implement recommendations issued by the U.N. Human Rights Committee in July 2001. It should also urge the DPRK to cooperate fully with and provide unrestricted access to United Nations Special Procedures.   Background  The DPRK ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in September 1981. Its second periodic report was filed with the U.N. Human Rights Committee in May 2000 after a lengthy delay (it was due in 1987). The DPRK is also a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.   Human Rights Watch has no access to the DPRK and has not carried out research inside the DPRK. The closed nature of the DPRK and the lack of access by private human rights organizations and U.N. human rights experts is a major obstacle to monitoring abuses and promoting improvements.   Human Rights Watch has conducted research with North Korean refugees who have fled to China, and now reside in Seoul. We collected testimony on horrific conditions and treatment in labor camps and prisons in the DPRK, which we have corroborated with information from other sources. In a report on North Korean refugees published in November 2002, HRW documented serious abuses including: arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of citizens based on family background; torture and cruel and degrading treatment of detainees in labor training camps, provincial concentration centers, and political prison camps known as administrative camps; and the use of forced labor.   Other reports of serious abuses in the DPRK include arbitrary arrests and detention, severe restrictions on basic and fundamental freedoms of belief, assembly, association, religion, press and freedom of movement, and use of the death penalty.   In its submission to the U.N. Human Rights Committee, the DPRK government claimed that torture is prohibited by law, that remedies are in place for those whose civil rights have been violated, that forced labor is """"never used as a means of political coercion or of social and religious punishment,"""" and that the DPRK's Criminal Procedures Act strictly limits detentions and arrests. The government also said that it had reduced the number of capital offenses from over thirty to five.   However, the U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concern that except for murder, the other capital offenses were basically political and vaguely defined so that the death penalty could be utilized to punish peaceful political activities. The Committee made recommendations regarding the use of the death penalty and public executions, torture, trafficking of women, cruel and degrading treatment in prisons, the lack of freedom of movement both within the DPRK and outside the country, the lack of freedom of expression, unfair trials, and the absence of independent human rights organizations in the DPRK.   Refugees  Criminal law in the DPRK prohibits unauthorized departure from the country, in violation of the fundamental right to leave one's country, guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. DPRK law provides potentially severe penalties for offenders, from a sentence of three years of labor re-education, to punishment by execution if """"one who escapes to another country or to the enemy in betrayal of his motherland"""" commits a """"serious violation.""""   Regardless of their reasons for leaving, anyone who leaves the DPRK may face imprisonment upon return, especially if they have encountered foreigners, journalists and aid workers. Thus many of those who flee the DPRK are transformed into refugees sur place, or persons who, while abroad, become entitled to protection as refugees because of the risk of political persecution should they return.   The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights should have access to all refugees forcibly returned to the DPRK to ascertain that their rights are fully respected and they are not subject to arbitrary detention, ill-treatment and punishment.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should adopt a resolution that would:  Express grave concern about serious abuses of human rights in the DPRK, and press the DPRK to fully implement the recommendations of the U.N. Human Rights Committee.  Call on the DPRK government to provide complete and unrestricted access to the U.N. special rapporteurs and working groups on arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment, religious freedom, violence against women, and on the independence of judges and lawyers.  Call on the DPRK government to provide the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights access to citizens who have left the country and been forcibly returned in order to determine their safety, treatment and welfare.","Asia, North Korea","United Nations"

The resolution should also call on the international community to meet its obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention to ensure the protection of civilians in circumstances of armed conflict and belligerent occupation.   Background  Civilians are increasingly paying the price for repeated, egregious violations of international humanitarian law by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and Palestinian armed groups. At least 1,985 Palestinians and 720 Israelis were killed between September 2000 and January 2003, the majority civilians, including more than 300 Palestinian and 80 Israeli children.   Excessive and indiscriminate use of force, willful killings, and impunity  The number and gravity of violations committed by the IDF escalated as clashes culminated in the military reoccupation of most areas of the Palestinian Authority (PA). Israeli soldiers repeatedly used indiscriminate and excessive force, killed civilians willfully and unlawfully, and used Palestinian civilians as human shields. Israel also used helicopter-fired missiles, tanks, and explosive devices to kill more than 175 individuals whom they accused of planning or carrying out attacks on Israeli military targets or civilians, sometimes in circumstances where the person could have been arrested and where Israeli forces showed insufficient regard for civilian life. The IDF continued to fail to investigate wrongful deaths or other violations by Israeli soldiers, and as of January 2003, had not responded to repeated requests from Human Rights Watch for information on killings the organization documented in Jenin.   Armed Palestinian violence against Israeli civilians-suicide bombings and other deliberate attacks-also reached unprecedented levels. PA officials condemned such attacks, but failed to move decisively against those responsible for ordering and organizing them. Armed Palestinians also killed at least twenty-two alleged collaborators.   Collective punishment  Extensive IDF damage to civilian buildings and infrastructure, including the partial or complete destruction of roads, sewage networks, water supplies, and electrical grids, appeared to exceed any requirement of military necessity in urban areas such as Jenin, Nablus and Ramallah. The IDF also destroyed hundreds of houses, primarily in Gaza, on alleged security grounds in excess of military necessity. Israeli forces also demolished homes of families of alleged suicide bombers or armed militants. Such demolitions often severely damaged adjacent properties. Tawfiq Hussam Obreika, a two-year-old child, was killed on October 13, 2002 when a neighboring house in Rafah was demolished.   Israeli restrictions on freedom of movement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip were so severe and widespread as to constitute collective punishment. These crippling restrictions were accompanied by extensive curfews. In the first week of July some 850,000 Palestinians were under curfew; by late September this number stood at some 550,000. Notifications of curfew impositions and liftings were often inconsistent and erratically enforced, resulting in numerous civilian deaths and injuries. Collective punishments also include restrictions on Palestinian travel abroad and a prohibition on working in Israel for all men under 35 years of age.   Humanitarian crisis  The cumulative impact of damage to civilian infrastructure, curfews and closures, and ongoing violence led the head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to describe the humanitarian situation as """"the most dire since 1967."""" Economic activity, already severely curtailed, is now at a virtual standstill. Unemployment stood at 50 percent in both the West Bank and Gaza, and more than 55 percent of inhabitants in the West Bank and 70 percent in Gaza lived under the poverty level of two dollars of consumption per day. Israeli authorities also restricted and harassed humanitarian agencies responsible for providing food, medication, and other essential goods and services in the West Bank and Gaza.   Settlements and settler violence  Israeli authorities continued to confiscate Palestinian lands to expand illegal Israeli settlements and bypass roads. Israeli settlers killed at least twelve Palestinian civilians during 2002, injured dozens more, and attacked Palestinian homes, fields, cars and other property, and blocked major roads with unofficial checkpoints. Israeli authorities rarely prevented, halted, or punished settlers for attacks against Palestinian civilians and their property.   Arbitrary arrest and detention and torture  An estimated 4,500 Palestinian civilians, including children, were arrested for questioning during Operation Defensive Shield, and a steady stream of arrests continued throughout the year. Reports of ill-treatment were widespread, including kicking, beating, squalid conditions, deprivation of food and drink, and even gradual reversion to the use of torture. As of January 2003, some 5,100 Palestinians were being held on security-related grounds - the highest level in over a decade. More than one thousand of them are held in administrative detention without charge - an increase from twenty-seven such detainees held in October 2001.   Protection imperative  The """"roadmap"""" developed under the auspices of the United States, the European Union, Russia, and the United Nations includes provisions for monitoring violations of cease-fire agreements. The need for observers to monitor and report on violations of international humanitarian law in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza Strip is an immediate imperative that the international community should move to implement immediately.   Recommendations  We strongly urge members of the Commission on Human Rights, bearing in mind their simultaneous obligations as High Contracting Parties to the Geneva Conventions, to adopt a resolution that would:  Condemn systematic and grave violations of international humanitarian and human rights law by all parties to the conflict.  Urge the United Nations Security Council to authorize the establishment of an international observer mission to monitor and report on continuing human rights and international humanitarian law violations in the West Bank and Gaza.  Incorporate the text and standards contained in the December 2001 Declaration of the reconvened conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention.  Call on Israel to conduct impartial investigations into all suspicious killings by members of its security forces, make the results public, and discipline or punish individuals found guilty of wrongdoing.  Call on the Palestinian Authority to arrest and bring to justice in accordance with international standards those responsible for attacks against Israeli civilians.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-iran","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Iran","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Iran","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to re-establish a Special Procedure to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Iran. The Commission should call upon the Iranian authorities to facilitate visits by thematic Special Procedures and working groups, and make public and time-based commitments to implementing their recommendations.   Background  The political standoff between reformists, in control of the directly elected elements of the government, and the conservatives who exercise authority through the office of the Leader, the Judiciary and the armed forces continues to hamper human rights progress. Political tensions have mounted. Of particular concern are the activities of shadowy underground paramilitary forces, linked to hardline conservative clerical leaders unwilling to relinquish their continuing grip on power.   Unfair Trials  The Revolutionary Court in Tehran, following patently unfair trials, sentenced more than thirty members of the Iran Freedom Movement (IFM) to prison terms, following the forcible dissolution of the party. Many defendants had been held incommunicado for months and coerced into making incriminatory statements. No credible evidence was presented that they had done anything except engage in legitimate, peaceful political activity. Fifteen National Religious Alliance (NRA) activists were also tried before the Revolutionary Court on spurious charges of seeking to overthrow the government after being held incommunicado for months in a secret Tehran detention center known as Prison 59. Detention conditions for several elderly prisoners have been a particular cause of concern.   Freedom of Expression  Prominent writers and journalists such as Emadedin Baqi, Akbar Ganji, Mohssen Youssefi Eshkevari, Ali Afshari, Khalil Rostamkhani and Saeid Sadre either remain in prison or face imprisonment charges solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression. The judiciary has confirmed the sentences of several lawyers associated with reformist causes, including cases relating to the assassinations of writers and intellectuals in 1998. One lawyer, Nasser Zarafshan, was sentenced to five years in prison and fifty lashes after he probed the involvement of Ministry of Intelligence officials in the 1998 murders. A Revolutionary Court in Hamedan sentenced Hashem Aghajari, a prominent academic, to death for alleged blasphemy and insulting the clergy.   Behrouz Geranpayeh, the Head of the National Institute for Opinion Polls, is awaiting his sentence after publishing a poll showing a majority of Iranians favor restoring relations with the United States. The heads of the private research institutes that conducted the poll, Abbas Abdi and Hossein Ali Ghazian, have been sentenced to eight and nine years of imprisonment respectively. They have been charged with """"collaboration with U.S. elements and British intelligence"""" and of conducting """"psychological warfare"""" against the government.   Senior Shi'a religious leaders and their supporters who dissent from the ruling clerical establishment remain targets of official persecution. Grand Ayatollah Hossain Ali Montazeri, the former designated successor to Ayatollah Khomeini as Leader of the Islamic Republic, cannot, among other things, meet with representatives from independent political groups under a restriction of freedom directive issued by the Iranian judiciary.   The government assault on the independent news media in which more than eighty-five newspapers have been closed and scores of journalists imprisoned since April 2000 has continued unabated. Recent cases include: Mohammad Salamati, editor of Our Era (Asr-e Ma), sentenced to 26 months in jail for views he expressed in the journal; Ali Hamed Iman, publisher of Shams-i Tabriz weekly, sentenced to seven months in jail and 74 lashes for allegedly publishing lies, stoking ethnic tensions, and """"insulting Islamic sanctities and officials""""; Mohsen Mirdamadi, managing editor of Norouz, a daily newspaper in Tehran, sentenced to six months in jail; and the closing of two major reformist newspapers, Hayato-no and Bahar.   Discrimination Against Religious and Ethnic Minorities  The lack of public school education in the Kurdish language remains a perennial source of Kurdish frustration. Followers of the Baha'i faith also continue to face persecution, including being denied permission to worship or to carry out other communal affairs publicly. At least four Baha'is are serving prison terms for their religious beliefs.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Re-establish a special mechanism to monitor and report on the human rights situation in Iran.

The resolution should name the different armies and armed groups that have perpetrated such violence, as well as denounce the role of the DRC government in supporting armed groups in eastern DRC, such as the RCD-ML.   The resolution should specifically name as perpetrators of violations of international humanitarian law the Ugandan Defence People's Force (UPDF), the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), and several armed groups, including the Union des Patriotes Congolais (UPC), the Congolese Rally for Democracy/ Liberation Movement (RCD-ML), the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), the Congolese Rally for Democracy/Goma (RCD-Goma), as well as Mai Mai rebels and Rwandan and Burundian Hutu armed groups. The DRC government has backed and equipped the RCD-ML and possibly other armed groups in the east.   The resolution should also call upon the DRC government to comply fully with its obligations under international law; in particular, to bring perpetrators of abuses to justice, to allow human rights defenders and government critics to speak out freely, to disband the Military Order Court (COM) and to reinstate the moratorium on executions.   The Commission should renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the DRC.   War abuses  During 2002, there was significant diplomatic progress towards a peaceful settlement of the DRC war. Following the signing of the peace accords between Rwanda and DRC (July 2002) and Uganda and DRC (September 2002), foreign troops from Rwanda and Uganda were largely withdrawn, though smaller numbers remained in DRC territory. In December 2002, Congolese warring parties and civilian actors signed an agreement on political transition in the DRC. Yet, armed groups and in some cases foreign armies continued to fight in the eastern parts of the country, and civilians remained the primary victims of the war in eastern DRC. During 2002, hundreds of civilians were killed by different armed groups. In May 2002, RCD-Goma forces killed at least 80 people in Kisangani in response to a short-lived mutiny. In the second half of 2002, armed groups fighting for control over Ituri province and adjacent parts of North Kivu killed hundreds of civilians. Combatants continued to submit women and girls to horrific acts of sexual violence, a pattern documented previously by Human Rights Watch. Government forces and armed groups in eastern DRC continue to recruit and use children as soldiers. In many cases, the fighting was motivated by a brutal quest for natural resources such as timber, diamonds, gold, coltan and other minerals.   Humanitarian crisis  The war in DRC has sparked a humanitarian crisis of catastrophic dimensions. Over two million people are currently displaced in eastern DRC, often without any access to humanitarian aid, and their numbers are rising.   Human rights defenders  Whether in government or rebel-held areas, human rights defenders were frequently targeted for their peaceful investigative and public activities. In Kinshasa, a leading human rights defender, Nsii Luanda, has been detained by the government since April 2002. In Bukavu, an independent radio station, run by civil society groups, Radio Maendeleo, has been shut down since December 2002 by the RCD-Goma, and its highest officials were detained for several days. In Ituri, a human rights defender named Honoré Musoko was held for several days in September 2002.   Justice and accountability  The justice system has collapsed in many parts of the country. In other areas, such as the government-held areas and the main cities in the east, institutions to deliver justice are formally in place, but are highly dependent on the political authorities. As a result, trials do not conform to minimum standards of fairness. In many other cases courts in the DRC have perpetuated impunity by allowing suspected criminals linked to political power to go free.   In January 2003, the trial of 135 men and women before the Military Order Court (COM) in Kinshasa, accused of involvement in the assassination of former President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, came to an end. 26 were sentenced to death and most others received prison sentences. The judges on the COM are members of the military or the security services and there is no right to appeal against COM sentences.   On January 7, fifteen people on death row were executed at a military camp near Kinshasa. This was the first time that executions took place since President Kabila imposed a moratorium on the death penalty in early 2001.   Dealing with past human rights abuses will be an important challenge for any post-conflict transition. There is broad agreement in DRC that war crimes and crimes against humanity cannot go unpunished, and various segments of civil society and some in the government have begun to call for the establishment of an international criminal tribunal of some type.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Condemn war crimes and crimes against humanity that have been committed by foreign armies and armed groups in eastern DRC, specifically Ituri, North and South Kivu, and call on all warring parties to stop targeting civilians through killings, sexual violence, child recruitment, and other unlawful acts. The resolution should name the different armies and armed groups that have perpetrated such violence, as well as denounce the role of the DRC government in supporting armed groups such as the RCD-ML.  Urge the U.N. Security Council to ensure that the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC), """"protect civilians under imminent threat of physical violence"""" as stated in its mandate, and that a substantial number of these forces be deployed to eastern and northeastern Congo.  Call upon the DRC government to comply fully with its human rights obligations; in particular, to bring perpetrators of abuses to justice, to allow human rights defenders and government critics to speak out freely, to disband the Military Order Court (COM) and to reinstate the moratorium on executions.  Renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the DRC and provide her with the necessary resources for meaningful interventions. Request her to undertake several visits to DRC in the coming months, including to crisis areas such as Kivu and Ituri.  Strengthen the Field Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in the DRC by increasing its international staff and its budget to allow them to carry out meaningful work.  Call upon the DRC government and all Congolese and foreign actors to ensure that perpetrators of abuses, including foreign nationals on all sides, are held accountable.  Urge the U.N. Security Council to establish a U.N. Commission of Experts to determine responsibility for grave violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the DRC since 1993, consult widely with government authorities and civil society in the DRC, and recommend an appropriate justice mechanism for the DRC.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-colombia","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Colombia","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on Colombia","","02/14/2003","Objective   Human Rights Watch urges the Commission on Human Rights to pass a resolution that would recommend the expansion of the U.N.'s human rights work in Colombia, including an increase in the number of permanent staff of the Office of the High Commissioner in Colombia, renegotiation of the Office's mandate to allow regular public reporting, and visits by thematic mechanisms to investigate specific aspects of Colombia's human rights crisis.   Background  Colombia's internal war has intensified over the past year following the collapse of peace talks in February 2002.   Paramilitary groups allied within the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC) commit massacres, selective killings, and death threats. These groups operate with the tolerance and often support of units within Colombia's military. There are numerous and credible reports of joint military-paramilitary operations and the sharing of intelligence and propaganda. Throughout Colombia, paramilitaries continue to move uniformed and heavily armed troops unhindered past military installations.   Local officials, human rights groups, the public advocate's office, and even some police detachments regularly inform the appropriate authorities about credible threats by paramilitaries. Yet only rarely do military forces take effective action to stop paramilitary advances. While massacres, traditionally used by paramilitaries to spread terror, were less numerous in 2002 than in past years, the decrease appears to reflect a change in paramilitary tactics rather than a diminution in overall violence. Witnesses have described to Human Rights Watch how paramilitaries seized large groups of people, then killed individuals separately to avoid the incidents being recorded as massacres.   Human Rights Defenders  Especially in rural areas and small towns, attacks against human rights defenders remain common. In 2002, sixteen defenders were reported killed, most by groups that were not clearly identified at the time of this writing. Those responsible for previous attacks remain largely unpunished. A two-year government effort to resolve outstanding cases, including the murders of human rights defenders, through a special interministerial committee has yet to deliver results.   Use of Emergency Measures  President çlvaro Uribe Vélez imposed several emergency measures that weakened the ability of state institutions to monitor and investigate alleged human rights violations and gave the security forces power to arrest and tap telephones without warrants in certain circumstances, but these were eventually struck down by the Constitutional Court. Another measure allowed the executive to place large areas under military control and restrict the movement of civilians and the entry of foreigners, including journalists working for international media. In September, the Uribe Administration announced that twenty-seven municipalities containing over one million people in the departments of Bol'var, Sucre, and Arauca had been designated """"rehabilitation and consolidation"""" zones where rights were curtailed.   President Uribe began recruiting a planned one million civilian informants to provide information in exchange for cash. In addition, Uribe authorized the army to recruit a force of 15,000 peasants to fight in their home regions with regular troops. Both strategies raise serious questions about the government's ability to ensure that informants and new recruits are not drawn from paramilitary groups, and threaten to repeat the tragic history of the 1980s, when similar laws combined with a lack of oversight led to egregious human rights violations.   Impunity for human rights crimes  Impunity for human rights crimes increased markedly as Attorney General Luis Camilo Osorio, who took office in mid-2001, undermined or derailed key ongoing prosecutions. His hostility to human rights investigations was evidenced by his purge of prosecutors and investigators willing to pursue such cases. In April 2002, seven prosecutors with the attorney general's Human Rights Unit and one member of the Technical Investigations Unit received threats related to their investigations of high-profile cases of human rights violations. When Osorio failed to take any measures to protect them, the officials requested protective measures from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Dozens of other prosecutors and investigators resigned or fled Colombia.   Attacks on Civilians  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP) escalated attacks on civilians, among them hundreds of mayors and other local officials. On February 7, 2003, guerrillas reportedly detnoated a 200-kilo car bomb in the parking structure of a social club in Bogota, killing at least thirty-two people and injuring over 150. When President Uribe was sworn in on August 7, guerrillas launched an attack with mortars and explosives in Colombia's capital, Bogot‡, killing at least nineteen bystanders.   In the first ten months of 2002, the FARC-EP used gas cylinder bombs in over forty attacks on cities and towns, causing mainly civilian casualties. On May 1, 119 displaced persons, including at least forty-eight children, were killed in Boyaj‡, Choc- when a gas cylinder bomb hit a church in which they had sought shelter. International observers concluded that the FARC-EP, which launched the gas cylinder bomb, was directly responsible for the deaths. However, they also criticized the military's failure to heed reports of paramilitary forces in the area and mount an operation to apprehend them.   Kidnapping and extrajudicial executions  Guerrillas sought to influence politics and raise money via kidnapping. As of this writing, presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, seized in February 2002, continues to be held by FARC-EP along with the governor of Antioquia; the former governor of Meta; a former defense minister; and hundreds of Colombians held for ransom. Victims included children as young as three-years-old, such as a girl kidnapped on July 18 in an effort to force her father, a mayor, to resign. According to Pa's Libre, a Colombian NGO, guerrillas were responsible for 58 percent of the 2,253 kidnappings recorded in the first nine months of 2002, while paramilitaries were linked to 6 percent. Others were linked to common criminals.   Both paramilitaries and guerrillas conducted extrajudicial executions of perceived opponents and indigenous leaders.   Forcible Displacement  According to the Consultancy for Human Rights and Internal Displacement (CODHES), over 200,000 Colombians were forcibly displaced in the first eight months of 2002, most by paramilitaries. CODHES also noted a dramatic increase in forced displacement provoked by the FARC-EP. In addition, at least 1.2 million Colombians have permanently left the country over the past five years according to the International Organization on Migration.   Targeting of Church Leaders and Trade Unionists  In a new disturbing development, church leaders who spoke out in favor of peace and human rights or who protested abuses were targeted by both sides, often during mass or prayer services. For instance, guerrillas were believed responsible for the murders of two Protestant pastors as they were preaching in a hall near San Vicente del Cagu‡n, Caquet‡, the unofficial capital of the zone previously ceded to guerrillas for peace talks. José Vicente Fl-rez, a member of the United Pentecostal Church, was shot and killed on July 14; Abel Ruiz, also a Pentecostal minister, was shot and killed in the same spot two weeks later. On March 16, a gunman killed Cali Archbishop Isaias Duarte Cancino, who frequently spoke out against corruption. In the first eleven months of 2002, eleven other priests, one nun, and eighteen Protestant pastors were killed in Colombia, more than in any comparable period in the country's recent history.   During 2002, over 170 trade unionists were murdered. Most of the killings were committed by paramilitaries, but there was also an alarming increase in attacks by the FARC-EP, thought to be responsible for at least nineteen of the killings.   Recommendations   The Commission on Human Rights should adopt a resolution that would:  Deplore Colombia's failure to implement recommendations made by the High Commissioner for Human Rights; call on Colombia to improve its record of implementation; and request the Office of the High Commissioner to submit a report on follow-up to the 60th session of the Commission.  Call for an increase in the number of permanent staff of the Office of the High Commissioner in Colombia. [Donor countries should increase their financial support of the Office and establish a budget that allows U.N. staff in Colombia to travel regularly around the country].  Request the High Commissioner to renegotiate the mandate of the Office in Colombia to include the power to transmit information on cases to international and nongovernmental organizations and the press as appropriate, and to release statements summarizing its investigations of the available evidence on a case-by-case basis.  Recommend that U.N. thematic mechanisms visit Colombia to investigate, in particular, the administration of justice, forced disappearances, attacks on human rights defenders, and violence against indigenous and ethnic groups, in particular Afro-Colombians.","Americas, Colombia","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/14/briefing-59th-session-un-commission-human-rights-china","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on China","Briefing to the 59th Session of the UN Commission on Human Rights on China","","02/14/2003","Objective    Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to adopt a resolution condemning China's violations of the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly, thought, conscience, religion and belief, and urging judicial proceedings that meet international standards. The resolution should also condemn the Chinese government's use of the international """"war on terrorism"""" to justify the imprisonment of Uighurs in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region for peacefully advocating full autonomy or independence; and protest its policy of forcibly returning North Korean asylum-seekers in violation of international law.   Background  In the last two-and-a half years, Human Rights Watch has documented abuses directed against political dissidents, religious believers, labor activists, alleged """"separatists"""" in Xinjiang and Tibet, and North Korean asylum seekers, as well as the political use of psychiatric imprisonment.   Freedom of association and the right to strike  In March 2002, large and well-organized worker demonstrations in several northeastern cities protested non-payment of back wages and pensions, unilateral rollbacks of severance agreements, absence of a social security safety net, and managerial corruption. Officials responded with arrests, attacks on unarmed protestors, and threats to fire workers whose relatives were participating. In December 2002, two worker-representatives in Liaoyang, Liaoning province, were charged with subversion, which carries potentially severe penalties. For several months after their detentions, the men had no access to defense counsel, and following the trial, the men's families were warned against communicating with the foreign media. China continues to deny workers the right to free association as guaranteed in China's constitution and in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, ratified by China.   Freedom of belief  In July 1999, Chinese authorities moved to dissolve Falungong and to arrest its leaders. A massive crackdown followed, hundreds were imprisoned and thousands sent without judicial review to reeducation-through-labor camps. The government labeled Falungong a cult, thus outside the purview of protected state-controlled religious organization. In addition, the government closed Christian churches, Muslim mosques, and Tibetan monasteries which resisted state control, and arrested clergy and laity who refused to comply with government edicts.   Crackdown in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region  Implementation of the nationwide """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign Xinjiang, justified as a counter-terrorism measure, resulted in summary trials and mass sentencing rallies as officials proceeded with """"quick arrest,"""" and """"quick proceedings."""" Although precise figures are unavailable, there have been credible reports of the extensive use of torture and the death penalty in the course of the campaign and little distinction made between criminal acts and peaceful expression of separatist sentiment. Printing houses producing unauthorized religious literature have been closed; mandatory """"patriotic reeducation"""" campaigns for imams instituted; surveillance of Muslim weddings, funerals, circumcisions, and house moving rituals stepped-up; clerics arrested; religious classes raided; traditional gatherings such as the meshrep banned; and mosques leveled.   Repatriation of North Korean asylum seekers  China, claiming that North Korean asylum seekers are economic migrants, has forcibly repatriated them although they may be severely punished upon their return home. China is a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol which prohibits such repatriation. China has not permitted the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to establish a presence on the China-North Korean border.   Freedom of expression  The Chinese authorities continue to progressively restrict the Internet in violation of the right to free expression. Broadly-worded decrees prohibit posting of information that violates the constitution, undermines the unity of the country, threatens social order, spreads rumors, promotes superstition, or injures the reputation of state organs. Regulations require Internet service providers to use only domestic media news postings, to record information useful for tracking the viewing habits of users, and to acquire the capacity to copy users' e-mails. Thousands of Internet cafes have been closed; foreign search engines have been shut down or selectively blocked; and dozens of activists arrested or sentenced to terms as long as eleven years.   Judicial proceedings  The legal rights of defendants are routinely compromised by police officials, prosecutors, and judges. Although the 1996 Criminal Procedure Law revisions added to defendants' rights, there is no presumption of innocence; defendants are denied timely access to counsel and to counsel of their own choosing; defense counsel's ability to gather and present evidence is severely limited in both the pre-trial period and during the trial itself; and although torture is officially prohibited, evidence obtained during torture is permitted at trial. Cases in point are those of Lobsang Dhondrup, reported to already have been executed, and Tenzin Delek Rinpoche, a prominent Tibetan spiritual leader sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve, in connection with a series of bombings. China also maintains a system of administrative justice which permits incarceration of thousands of citizens each year for up to three years without benefit of judicial review.   Recommendations  The Commission on Human Rights should:  Condemn China's grave human rights abuses. The resolution should call on the Chinese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release all those held for peacefully exercising their rights of free speech, expression, and association including those accused of religious or political offenses, labor activism, and so-called separatist activities; to abolish the reeducation-through-labor system; to amend all relevant Chinese laws and regulations, such as the Trade Union Law, to bring them into conformity with international human rights law; to rescind the reservation to Article 8(1)(a) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; and to permit workers to form and join their own trade unions and to bargain collectively.  The resolution should further urge revision of the Law on Protecting State Secrets to bring the scope of information deemed secret in line with international human rights standards; amend China's constitution so that freedom of belief encompasses manifestation of that belief """"in worship, observance, practice and teaching;"""" rescind the requirement that to be legal, a congregation must be vetted and registered; permit foreign and domestic legal observers to attend all trials as provided for under international human rights standards; revise the Criminal Procedure Code such that the rights of defendants during trial and pre-trial proceeding are equal to those of prosecutors.  Urge China to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which it signed in October 1998.  Insist that China honor its refugee commitments, immediately halt all repatriation of North Koreans entering China, and begin a dialogue with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees about access to the China-North Korea border.  Cooperate with U.N. mechanisms. The resolution should call on the Chinese government to invite U.N. Rapporteurs--particularly the Special Rapporteurs on torture, on freedom of religion, and on the independence of lawyers and judges to visit China. The Rapporteurs should pay special attention to the situation of Uighurs in the Xinjiang-Uighur Autonomous Region.","Asia, China and Tibet","United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/13/letter-president-nazarbaev","Letter to President Nazarbaev","Letter to President Nazarbaev","Regarding the Due Process Rights of Sergei Duvanov","02/13/2003","We are writing to express our deepest concern about the case of Sergei Duvanov, a journalist who on January 28 was convicted of rape by the Karasai District Court. We believe that Mr. Duvanov was denied his right to due process during the police investigation and his right to a fair trial. These concerns, as well as the circumstances surrounding the case, strongly suggest that the case against him was politically motivated and that his conviction represents a miscarriage of justice. We ask that you ensure an impartial review of the charges against him, and that he be released prior to such a review.   On October 28, 2002, Karaisi district police arrested Duvanov and accused him of forcibly raping a minor the previous day. On January 28, the Karasai District Court convicted him on these charges and sentenced him to three and half years of imprisonment. Duvanov has maintained his innocence.  Human Rights Watch cannot comment on Duvanov’s guilt or innocence, but we believe that he was denied his basic rights to due process and a fair trial. Available information indicates that he was not afforded the opportunity to present an adequate defense, and that the trial court was not impartial in its proceedings.  The principle of “equality of arms” is enshrined in international standards and Kazakh law, as an essential element of the right to adequate facilities to prepare a criminal defense. Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights states that “everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees in full equality: to have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of his defense . . .” But prior to trial, in the crucial area of forensic testing, Duvanov was denied this right. Neither Duvanov nor defense counsel were given copies of the orders for six sets of forensic testing. Hence, neither Duvanov nor defense counsel could exercise the right under article 244 (2-3) of the Kazakh criminal procedure code to petition for the appointment of experts or challenge the appointment of the prosecution’s experts.  In several important respects the court demonstrated a lack of impartiality, which violates Duvanov’s right under article 14 of the ICCPR to a “fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal.” The court declined to hold pretrial hearings at which defense counsel could have brought allegations of serious due process violations committed during the investigation. In declining counsel’s request for such hearings the court reasoned that no violations had taken place. The court refused to allow Duvanov to meet in private with defense counsel during the first week of the trial.  The court’s failure to respect the principle of equality of arms further eroded its impartiality: it refused without explanation to admit as evidence numerous items that defense counsel believes to have been exculpatory. In one example, the court declined defense counsel’s petition to review or admit as evidence important information about the circumstances placing the victim and her family in Kainar—the village where Duvanov’s summer cottage is located—one month before the alleged offense took place. Neither the police nor the court probed court testimony that a police officer paid a local resident to lodge the victim and her mother because they were “important witnesses in a case.”  The court also declined a petition by defense counsel to have an expert witness examine the lock on the kitchen door at Duvanov’s summer cottage, which was vital to the account given by the victim.  The court admitted as evidence testimony by three important prosecution witnesses who failed to appear for court hearings. It is unclear why the court found it acceptable to accept their testimony without giving defense counsel the opportunity to cross-examine them. It also admitted as evidence testimony by a neighbor who claimed that he understood by an ambiguous physical gesture—the nodding of his head in response to the neighbor’s nod—that Duvanov was acknowledging his guilt.  The circumstances surrounding Duvanov’s arrest suggest political involvement that may in turn have unduly influenced the court. Duvanov has been a long-time critic of government policies and official corruption. He had been scheduled to travel to the United States on October 29 to be honored by the International League for Human Rights, and to speak at numerous forums about government corruption and the poor state of civil liberties in Kazakhstan. This is not the first time Duvanov has been the apparent target of politically motivated criminal prosecution. In July, prosecutors brought charges against Duvanov for his Internet postings about government attempts to silence journalists covering Swiss and U.S. investigations into alleged corruption. On August 30, he was viciously attacked by unknown assailants, who inflicted a head injury and knife wounds. These events occurred in a context of the growing incursions on media freedoms in Kazakhstan, a trend confirmed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.  We urge your government to undertake an impartial review of the case against Sergei Duvanov and take appropriate action.  Thank you for your attention to these concerns.  Sincerely, Elizabeth Andersen Executive Director Europe and Central Asia division","Europe/Central Asia, Kazakhstan",""

A reported twenty-seven people were killed and many more injured after protests degenerated into violent clashes in La Paz. The violence occurred when some 7,000 striking police officers and civilian protesters clashed with military troops, as protesters demanded that President Gonzalo Sánchez de Lozada rescind a new income tax.  The violence was concentrated around the Plaza Murillo and neighboring streets. The striking police and military reportedly engaged in a gun battle for control of the area, with snipers also reported.  """"The large number of deaths raises serious concerns that security forces failed to exercise proper care in responding to the protests,"""" said Joanne Mariner, Deputy Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Bolivian government could take a big step towards restoring confidence in its authority by making a firm commitment to ensuring that these killings will be properly investigated.""""  A number of civilian protesters were reportedly beaten and taken away by military police. Widespread looting was also reported, and buildings were burned.

The day's violence is the most lethal since civilian government was established in Bolivia in 1982. It takes place against a backdrop of escalating political and social unrest.  On January 13, 2003, coca growers and other groups began to block roads and stage large and aggressive protests across the country.

Activists have expressed strong fears that others have been specifically targeted for arrest in the coming days to prevent them from participating in an upcoming demonstration planned for February 15, 2003.  In recent weeks, state security forces have used Egypt's state of emergency law to administratively detain individuals who took part in peaceful demonstrations expressing opposition to a possible war in Iraq or support for the Palestinian uprising. Activists have expressed strong fears that others have been specifically targeted for arrest in the coming days to prevent them from participating in an upcoming demonstration planned for February 15, 2003. """"Egyptian citizens have every right to peacefully express their opposition to war in Iraq, or to anything else,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The right to free expression is enshrined in international law and the Egyptian constitution.""""  Megally said the arrests raised serious concerns about the use of Egypt's emergency legislation to crack down on basic freedoms. He urged the Egyptian government not to ban peaceful demonstrations, as it has done in response to crises in the past.  Human Rights Watch called on the Egyptian government to either charge those arrested with recognizable criminal offenses and bring them promptly before a civilian court, or to release them immediately.  At 3:00 o'clock in the morning of February 8, 2003, plainclothes officers, apparently from Egypt's State Security Intelligence (SSI - Mabahith Amn al-Dawla), raided the home of Ibrahim al-Sahary, an Egyptian journalist writing for Al-'Alam Al-Youm newspaper, and the author of a recent book criticizing United States and Arab policies in the region, """"Iraq: A New War for Hegemony and Oil."""" According to family members, the arresting officers showed no warrant or identification, or an administrative detention order. They searched his books, papers and possessions, and questioned him about his activities relating to Iraq before taking him away.  Al-Sahary was taken to SSI headquarters in Cairo. He was later transferred to Mazra'at Tora prison where he is reportedly being held in solitary confinement under administrative detention. Under emergency laws in force in Egypt, an administrative detainee can be held without charge or hearing for one month, subject to indefinite renewal. Al-Sahary has not been allowed family visits nor access to legal counsel.  On the afternoon of February 9, Sabri al-Sammak, a film producer and anti-war activist, was similarly arrested at home by SSI forces and is also now administratively detained in solitary confinement at Mazra'at Tora prison. Both al-Sahary and al-Sammak had taken part in a peaceful demonstration on January 31 protesting a possible war in Iraq. Egyptian human rights activists have expressed concern that these arrests may be intended to intimidate participants in a planned demonstration at al- Zeinab district of Cairo on February 15.  These arrests follow the detention in January of eleven alleged members of the Egyptian People's Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian Uprising. They were arrested at or shortly after demonstrations against the potential Iraq war, and against a new draft labor law, which were held on January 18 in the al- Sayyida Zeinab district of Cairo, and in front of the People's Assembly building. A 15-year-old student was released within a week; three other detainees were freed within two weeks. Others - including Mohammad Khalil Ghattas, Mohammed Husni Mahmud, Mohammed al-Dakhli Ahmed, Mahmud Hussein, Abdul Gawad Mustafa, Samir al-Fuli, and Tamer Hendawi--are believed still to be held at Mazra'at Tora prison.  The fifteen-year-old boy detained on January 18 has allegedly been severely tortured, including by electric shocks, while in the hands of the SSI. Human Rights Watch called on the Egyptian government to investigate the treatment of these detainees, to punish officials responsible for any torture or ill-treatment, and to compensate the victims.  Egypt's Emergency Law No. 162 of 1958 allows the government to suspend basic civil liberties by declaring a state of emergency, which has been in force almost continuously since 1967. Regular renewal of the legislation is required, and is up for consideration by the People's Assembly this spring.

The decision will also allow a number of other cases pending in Belgium to move forward, including that of former Chadian dictator Hissène Habré. The Sabra and Shatilla case was brought under a 1993 law, which gives Belgian courts the authority to prosecute persons accused of genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes regardless of where the crimes took place or whether the suspect or the victims are Belgian. Wednesday's ruling made clear that investigations could go forward even when the suspect was outside of the country. The Belgian Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) ruled Wednesday that one of those named by the massacre victims in a criminal complaint, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, enjoyed immunity from prosecution as long as he serves in that position, but that investigations could proceed against his co-defendant, former Israeli army commander Amos Yaron. """"This decision is a huge victory not only for the victims of the Sabra and Shatilla massacres but for all atrocity victims who have put their hopes in the Belgian justice system,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"There is abundant evidence that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed in the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, but not a single individual has been brought to justice."""" As Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon had overall responsibility over the Israeli Defense Forces and allowed Phalangist militias to enter the camps where they terrorized the residents for three days. In February 1983, the three-member Israeli official independent commission of inquiry charged with investigating the events known as the Kahan Commission named former Defense Minister Sharon as one of the individuals who """"bears personal responsibility"""" for the Sabra and Shatilla massacre. Human Rights Watch noted that the decision will allow the case against Chad's exiled former president, Hissène Habré, to go forward after a Belgian judge and police team visited Chad last year to investigate the charges. Habré lives in exile in Senegal, where he was indicted two years ago on charges of torture and crimes against humanity before the Senegalese courts ruled that he could not be tried there. The president of Senegal has agreed to hold Habré pending an extradition request from Belgium and the government of Chad recently told Belgium that it would waive any immunity that Habré might seek to assert.","Africa, Chad, Europe/Central Asia, Belgium","International Justice"

The U.S. federal and state governments must ensure that marriages receive legal recognition without discrimination.  “The court has rightly held that discrimination is as wrong in civil marriage as in any other public institution,” said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. “Separate but equal holds true no more in marriage than it did in education.”   On November 18, the Supreme Judicial Court—Massachusetts’ highest court—ruled that the state “has failed to identify any constitutionally adequate reason for denying civil marriage to same-sex couples.” The court required the state legislature to give those couples the rights enjoyed by married people within 180 days.   Governor Mitt Romney, Attorney General Thomas Reilly and members of the state legislature then proposed that the legislature instead create “civil unions” for gay and lesbian couples, providing many of the rights of marriage. Legislators then asked the Supreme Judicial Court for an advisory opinion on whether a law creating such unions—but restricting marriage to heterosexual couples—would meet its requirements.   “The history of our nation has demonstrated that separate is seldom, if ever, equal,” the court held in the advisory opinion. The court maintained that Massachusetts could not create an “unconstitutional, inferior and discriminatory status for same-sex couples.” The court also condemned any difference in rights or any “choice of language” that assigned such couples “to second-class status.”   In a September 2003 briefing paper on equality in civil marriage, Human Rights Watch observed that while civil unions have represented progress, states still have an obligation to equality. Civil unions do not carry the same promises of recognition across international borders that marriage ordinarily implies. The burden is on governments to justify refusing recognition to foreign marriages, but the burden usually—and unfairly—rests on partners in civil unions to justify their recognition abroad.   “States may create a special form of partnership for all couples in addition to the option of marriage,” said Roth. “But civil unions should not be created as a means to deny same-sex couples equal rights.”   The Defense of Marriage Act, enacted by the U.S. government in 1996, prohibits the federal government from recognizing same-sex marriages and allows states to withhold such recognition. An eventual constitutional challenge to this law is likely in light of the Massachusetts ruling.   In 1994 the United Nations Human Rights Committee found in its decision in Toonen v. Australia that discrimination based on sexual orientation is a violation of international human rights. Last year the Human Rights Committee determined that denying government pension benefits to same-sex partners is unacceptable discrimination. The European Court of Human Rights reached a similar conclusion in its 2003 ruling in the case of Karner v. Austria.   Two European countries, the Netherlands and Belgium, recognize full equality in civil marriage. However, same-sex marriages performed in these countries are still not recognized across the European Union.   “The Massachusetts decision will challenge lawmakers to acknowledge that marriage is not exempt from the commitment to equal treatment,” said Roth. “It is discriminatory to refuse to recognize marriages on the basis of sexual orientation.”   Massachusetts will still convene a constitutional convention to decide whether to amend the state’s constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage. However, such an amendment would have to be ratified by the state’s voters and could not take effect until 2006. Before then, full equality in marriage would thus become the law in Massachusetts.   Human Rights Watch was signatory to an amicus brief to the Supreme Judicial Court, which cites international law and practice in urging it to require full equality in marriage.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/02/05/iraqi-kurdistan-human-rights-abuses-committed-ansar-al-islam","Iraqi Kurdistan- Human Rights Abuses Committed by Ansar al-Islam","Iraqi Kurdistan: Human Rights Abuses Committed by Ansar al-Islam","","02/05/2003","Ansar al-Islam came together as a group in September 2001, initially under the name of Jund al-Islam (Soldiers of Islam), but its constituent factions have existed for several years. Espousing an ultra-orthodox Islamic ideology reminiscent of Wahhabism, the group's leaders issued decrees imposing their strict interpretation of Islam on the local inhabitants and introducing harsh punishments for those who failed to comply with their decrees. Since its establishment, the group's armed fighters have engaged in intermittent clashes with the forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), in whose stronghold Biyara and Tawela are located. During a mission to Iraqi Kurdistan in September 2002, Human Rights Watch investigated reports of human rights abuses perpetrated by members of Ansar al-Islam in areas under their control. These reports suggested that Ansar al-Islam had been responsible for arbitrary arrests of numerous Kurdish civilians, prolonged and illegal detention, the torture and ill-treatment of detainees, and the killing of combatants after surrender. In Sulaimaniya and Halabja Human Rights Watch interviewed a number of people who said they had been targeted by Ansar al-Islam or had fled for fear of further abuse. Among them were victims of torture, the relatives of detainees, and internally displaced persons. For its part, Ansar al-Islam has said that its members or supporters have been the targets of repression by the two principal political parties in Iraqi Kurdistan. Human Rights Watch met with dozens of Islamist detainees, some of whom were accused of links with Ansar al-Islam by the PUK and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). They were held in PUK and KDP custody in Sulaimaniya and Arbil respectively, for the most part in prolonged detention without trial and without any legal basis. Some of them reported being tortured or otherwise ill-treated during interrogation. Both KDP and PUK officials denied that torture was being used in their respective prisons, and told Human Rights Watch that any such allegations would be investigated and perpetrators would be punished. While in Iraqi Kurdistan, Human Rights Watch received information from a wide range of sources on persons allegedly targeted by both the KDP and the PUK for suspected links with Islamist groups, including Ansar al-Islam. PUK officials have repeatedly accused Ansar al-Islam of having links with Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network, and that its members included Arabs of various nationalities who had received military training in Afghanistan. The PUK also said some fifty-seven """"Arab Afghan"""" fighters had entered Iraqi Kurdistan via Iran in mid-September 2001. While Human Rights Watch did not investigate these alleged links, the testimonies of villagers who had fled Biyara and Tawela and were interviewed in September 2002 appeared to support this contention. A number of them, including former detainees, said that there were foreigners among Ansar al-Islam forces, that on occasion they were interrogated by non-Iraqis speaking various Arabic dialects, and that they had heard other languages spoken that they did not recognize. Scores of Iraqi Kurds affiliated to Ansar al-Islam, including key leaders, consider themselves veterans of the Afghan war. They had spent time in Afghanistan, initially fighting against Soviet forces during the 1980s. Representatives of other Iraqi Kurdish Islamist groups who maintain links with Ansar al-Islam told Human Rights Watch that a small number of Iraqi Kurds affiliated to the group had also fought alongside the Taliban, and that they then returned to Iraqi Kurdistan following the latter's defeat. There are also other indications of possible Ansar al-Islam connections with al-Qaeda operatives in Afghanistan. Documents discovered in an al-Qaeda guest house in Afghanistan by the New York Times discuss the creation of an """"Iraqi Kurdistan Islamic Brigade"""" just weeks prior to the formation of Ansar al-Islam in December 2001, and some Ansar al-Islam members in PUK custody have described in credible detail training in al-Qa'ida camps in Afghanistan. The existence of any ongoing links between al-Qa'ida and Ansar al-Islam is unknown. Human Rights Watch has not investigated the alleged links between the Iraqi government and Ansar al-Islam, and is not aware of any convincing evidence supporting this contention. On the other hand, the location of the group's bases very close to the Iranian border, taken together with credible reports of the return of some Ansar al-Islam fighters to Iraqi Kurdistan through Iran, suggest that these fighters have received at least limited support from some Iranian sources. Villagers living under Ansar al-Islam control, and mainstream Islamists who have visited those areas, reported to Human Rights Watch that Iranian agents had been present on occasion. However, the exact nature of relations between the two sides is unclear: PUK and other sources acknowledged that Iran had played a mediating role aimed at ending the clashes between PUK and Ansar al-Islam forces.  Armed Islamist groups in Iraqi Kurdistan After Kurdish forces took control of Iraq's three northern provinces following the government's withdrawal in October 1991, numerous opposition groups operated in the region. Islamist political forces in Iraqi Kurdistan, which are exclusively Sunni Muslim, were represented in the Islamic Movement in Kurdistan (IMK), established in 1987. The IMK brought together several factions, some of whose members had fought in Afghanistan during the 1980s. By the mid-1990s the IMK was considered the third most significant political and military force in the Kurdish region, after the KDP and the PUK. After unsuccessfully contesting the 1992 parliamentary elections, the IMK operated largely outside the framework of the joint Kurdish administration, focusing instead on developing and strengthening a separate administrative, political and military infrastructure in areas under its control, notably in Hawraman and Sharazur, which bordered the region controlled by the PUK. In December 1993 tensions between the IMK and the PUK peaked in armed clashes in parts of Sulaimaniya and Kirkuk provinces. The IMK was forced to retreat to areas close to the border with Iran. The leadership left the eastern region altogether and for some months remained under KDP protection in Salahuddin. When increasing tensions between the KDP and the PUK deteriorated into armed clashes in May 1994, IMK forces fought alongside the KDP against the PUK. Eventually, the IMK leadership was able to return to its strongholds in Hawraman and Sharazur, and to establish its headquarters in the city of Halabja. The IMK splintered over power struggles as well as policy differences. In May 2001 'Ali Bapir, a long-time IMK military commander, announced the formation of the Islamic Group in Iraqi Kurdistan. Several smaller factions within the IMK, which espoused a more puritanical and ultra-orthodox Islamic ideology, also broke away from the movement at different times. Some opposed any form of cooperation with """"secular"""" political parties and disagreed with the IMK's 1997 decision to participate in the PUK regional government. They also called for stricter application of the shari'a (Islamic law) in IMK-held areas. Of these factions, the most important militarily was a group known as the Soran Forces. It consisted of several hundred armed fighters (said to include non-Iraqi Arabs), some of who had fought in Afghanistan. A second faction was the Islamic Unification Movement (IUM, or al-Tawhid), said to be the most extremist of the splinter groups. Composed of some thirty or forty individuals, the IUM based itself for a time in Balek, in the Qandil mountains near Haj Omran and close to the Iran border. A third group, Hamas, also opposed the IMK's decision to participate in the PUK regional government. Among its stated aims was to launch attacks on secular institutions in Iraqi Kurdistan, including Western humanitarian and relief organizations.  The emergence of Ansar al-Islam These smaller breakaway factions themselves gradually merged. In July 2001, al-Tawhid joined with Hamas to form the Islamic Unity Front (IUF), which the Soran Forces also joined the following month. On September 1, 2001, the IUF was dissolved and its three component groups announced the formation of Jund al-Islam. The group promptly declared jihad (holy war) against secular and other political parties in Iraqi Kurdistan deemed to have deviated from the """"true path of Islam"""". Following armed clashes in which the PUK defeated Jund al-Islam, the group was dissolved in December 2001 and renamed Ansar al-Islam. A long-time member of the IMK, Najmuddin Faraj Ahmad, known as Mala Fateh Krekar, became its amir (leader). The ideas and practices propagated by Jund al-Islam (and later Ansar al-Islam) represent a radical departure from mainstream Sunni Islam as practiced in Iraqi Kurdistan. The group appears to have more in common with ultra-orthodox Wahabi movements emanating from Saudi Arabia. This doctrine entails a literal interpretation of the Qur'an, and advocates a return to the proclaimed purity of the early Islamic community. Jund al-Islam declared it was seeking to """"defend the areas under the influence of the Muslims from interference and control by the secularists,"""" and that among its aims was """"the propagation of virtue and the prevention of vice"""" (al-amr bil ma'ruf wal nahiy 'an al-munkar), as well as ensuring the application of shari'a and undertaking """"the religious duty of jihad against the secularist apostates.""""  Human rights abuses by Jund al-Islam/Ansar al-Islam On September 8, 2001, one week after it came into being, Jund al-Islam issued decrees, including: the obligatory closure of offices and businesses during prayer time and enforced attendance by workers and proprietors at the mosque during those times; the veiling of women by wearing the traditional 'abaya; obligatory beards for men; segregation of the sexes; barring women from education and employment; the removal of any photographs of women on packaged goods brought into the region; the confiscation of musical instruments and the banning of music both in public and private; and the banning of satellite receivers and televisions. Jund al-Islam also announced that it would apply Islamic punishments of amputation, flogging and stoning to death for offenses such as theft, the consumption of alcohol and adultery. Human Rights Watch is not aware of any amputations or stonings having been carried out, but local villagers reported the cases of three men who were flogged after being accused of drinking alcohol. Jund al-Islam also announced a crackdown on religious practices it considered polytheistic. On September 4, 2001, its forces entered three villages whose inhabitants were members of a minority religious sect, Ahl al-Haq (known locally as Kaka'is), whose beliefs combine Zoroastrianism and Shi'ism. The families were rounded up and ordered to adhere strictly to the Jund al-Islam decrees. Over the ensuing weeks, efforts were made to force Kaka'is to abandon their faith. Those who refused were apparently told they would be made to pay a """"religious tax"""" imposed on all non-Muslims, as well as risk having their property seized. A number of Kaka'i holy shrines were defaced or destroyed. One villager from the main Kaka'i village of Hawar told Human Rights Watch that on September 23, 2001, representatives of Jund al-Islam told the inhabitants that they had three choices: to adhere to the group's school of Islam, pay fines in lieu, or leave the area altogether. According to his account, the majority of the estimated 450 households from the three Kaka'i villages fled their homes and have since become internally displaced. According to more recent reports, Jund al-Islam laid mines in the agricultural plots owned by Kaka'i villagers, apparently in an effort to deter them from returning to their homes. The community of Naqshabandi Sufis, another minority religious group whose shaikhs have long inhabited the Biyara and Tawela region, were also prevented from performing their religious rites. This crackdown had begun even before the founding of Jund al-Islam. Members of its groups had closed down several holy sites, including the burial place of Shaikh Husamaddin Naqshabandi, a traditional place of pilgrimage for members of the order. In mid-July 2002 his tomb was desecrated and his remains removed by Jund al-Islam and buried elsewhere. A Naqshabandi shaikh who had fled to Halabja told Human Rights Watch that Jund al-Islam has accused adherents of his faith of being infidels, and imposed on women a strict dress code and severely curtailed their freedom to leave their homes. Jund al-Islam also targeted individuals as part of their campaign. One of their victims was a local singer from Biyara, Arjumand Hawrami, arrested on September 11, 2001 upon his return from a visit to Iran where he had given a performance. He told Human Rights Watch that he was held for almost two weeks and repeatedly beaten after being accused of being an infidel and of encouraging inappropriate behavior such as singing and dancing. He was released only after making an apology, promising that he would abandon his profession, and paying a fine of 1,000 dinars. Another case was that of Dr. Rebwar Sayyid 'Umar, who was abducted from his surgery in Halabja on September 22, 2001 and detained in the vicinity of Biyara. He was apparently accused of being a spy for the U.S., and was blindfolded and beaten during interrogation. He was released twenty days later after being exchanged for an Iraqi Arab detainee in PUK custody. Several other villagers from Biyara, Tawela and the surrounding region gave Human Rights Watch similar testimony. Some of those taken into custody were accused by Jund al-Islam of being affiliated to the PUK. In others cases, they were accused of violating the Islamic codes introduced in the area. Two of those interviewed also said they were told by their captors that they would be exchanged for Arab detainees being held in PUK custody. Most said that the release of detainees was invariably contingent upon the payment of a sum of money to Jund al-Islam. Former detainees also described the routine use of torture and other forms of ill-treatment during interrogation. In one case, a former policeman employed by the PUK administration had acid poured onto his hands on the day of his release. He gave Human Rights Watch photographs taken shortly after his release of the burn marks on his skin. The scars from the burns were visible to the interviewer. He had been abducted from Halabja on March 11, 2001 by one of the factions that later formed Jund al-Islam and held for three days. During those three days he was beaten and forced to lie down in the snow overnight while semi-clad. In another case, a school teacher from Tawela was arrested on August 24, 2002 and held for five days. The teacher told Human Rights Watch that he had been beaten so badly on his back that he was unable to lie down for three weeks following his release. He showed Human Rights Watch photographs of the injuries he had sustained. Further human rights abuses were perpetrated in the context of the continuing clashes between Jund al-Islam and PUK forces. Tensions between the two sides led to the outbreak of armed clashes near the villages of Gomalar and Tapa Drozna on September 23, 2001. On the same day, thirty-seven PUK fighters were killed by Jund al-Islam in the village of Kheli Hama on the Sulaimaniya-Halabja road. Twelve were killed in an ambush or during the ensuing exchange of fire, but the remaining twenty-five were reportedly killed after surrender. A farmer from Kheli Hama interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that he was in the village when it was surrounded by Jund al-Islam, and that he had witnessed the killing of five PUK fighters after they had laid down their weapons and surrendered. Some prisoners' throats had been slit, while others had been beheaded; some of the bodies were mutilated, including by having their sexual organs severed. They were apparently found with their hands tied behind their back. Photographs taken by the PUK of the victims' bodies were shown on the party's satellite television channel, KurdSat, on September 26. Following the capture of the Shinirwe heights from Jund al-Islam in the first week of October, the PUK announced it had found among the materials seized a videocassette showing the victims' bodies, apparently filmed by Jund al-Islam. It was broadcast on KurdSat on October 5. None of the perpetrators have been apprehended to date, but at least one of the suspects was reportedly killed in subsequent clashes with PUK forces. Fierce clashes continued between PUK and Jund al-Islam forces for over two weeks, killing scores on both sides. The fighting also spread to Halabja. By September 26, the PUK had reasserted its control over Halabja. In late September and during the first half of October 2001, the PUK arrested scores, reportedly on suspicion of complicity in acts of sabotage. They were said to include members of Jund al-Islam as well as the IMK and the Islamic Group. On October 11, 2001, the PUK announced a temporary ceasefire, reportedly to allow merger talks between Jund al-Islam and the Islamic Group to proceed. The talks failed and fighting resumed near Biyara and Tawela. Two weeks later, on October 25, the PUK issued a thirty-day amnesty for Jund al-Islam fighters, excluding those believed responsible for the February 18, 2001 assassination of the governor of Arbil, Franso Hariri, and those involved in the Kheli Hama killings of September 23. Jalal Talabani also said that foreign nationals in the ranks of Jund al-Islam would not be permitted to remain in Iraqi Kurdistan. Despite the amnesty, armed clashes continued into November, as did killings outside the immediate context of the fighting. Following the dissolution of Jund al-Islam and its reconstitution under the name of Ansar al-Islam in December 2001, the group announced a ceasefire. Talks were held with the PUK between December 2001 and late March 2002, aimed at arriving at a political agreement, but the assassination attempt on April 2, 2002 against Barham Salih, prime minister in the PUK regional government, led to their suspension. A statement issued by Ansar al-Islam's Shura Council on April 3 denied any involvement in the incident, but PUK officials later released the names of three of the suspects it had apprehended and said there was evidence linking them to Ansar al-Islam. The evidence reportedly included military identification cards issued by the PUK to its armed forces and found in the possession of the suspects, which belonged to some of the PUK fighters killed at Kheli Hama. The number of suspects arrested in the aftermath of the assassination attempt was not known at the time of writing: Ansar al-Islam said """"hundreds"""" of Muslim youths were arrested by the PUK, among them six women. It said that the detained women were released following meetings with the PUK in Sulaimaniya on April 18 and 19. On May 4, the leader of Ansar al-Islam, Mala Fateh Krekar, issued an amnesty for PUK fighters and those of other political groups who had assisted them. At the same time, Ansar al-Islam accused the PUK of deploying additional forces in the vicinity of Biyara and Tawela in the first week of May 2002 and said that consequently it would suspend further talks until three conditions were met: the release of all """"Muslim prisoners"""" in PUK custody, the withdrawal of PUK forces to the positions they had occupied prior to September 9, 2001, and the allocation of a monthly payment from the PUK regional government's revenues to meet Ansar al-Islam's expenses. In June 2002, relations between the two sides deteriorated further as the PUK held Ansar al-Islam responsible for attempting to perpetrate more acts of sabotage. These included at least two attempted suicide bombings and the attempted bombing up of a cultural center in Sulaimaniya. On December 4, 2002, a group of Ansar al-Islam fighters attacked two PUK posts near Halabja, briefly seizing control of them. PUK officials claimed that about half of the fifty PUK casualties had been killed after they had surrendered or been captured. Some surviving PUK fighters gave eyewitness accounts of executions of captured PUK fighters by Ansar al-Islam to international journalists.","Middle East/North Africa, Iraq","Crisis and Conflict"

Some children I saw were working just down the road from government offices designated to protect them.   The abuse of the law in India is not limited to just three states; it is everywhere. Just last month, a nongovernmental organization rescued 13 children in Bombay. They were working 18 hours a day making gold thread. They were burned with hot tongs if they fell asleep.   After the first investigation of bonded child labor in 1996 by the advocacy group Human Rights Watch, some promising steps were taken. In a groundbreaking decision, the Supreme Court ordered the government to rehabilitate children working in industries, such as silk, that are deemed hazardous.   The National Human Rights Commission, with limited resources, persuaded some government officials to free and rehabilitate bonded children in a few areas, especially the carpet belt in Uttar Pradesh. But most government efforts did not reach beyond high- profile industries, like carpet weaving and handrolled cigarettes. Now the Indian government is backtracking. Officials say that child bondage is rare and that they have stopped prosecuting and punishing employers because it is no longer needed. This is simply not true.   Caste-based discrimination is at the heart of bonded labor. Nallanayaki, like the vast majority of bonded laborers, is a dalit, a so-called untouchable, on the lowest rung of India's caste system. Across India, dalits are segregated from their upper-caste counterparts, denied access to land, forced to work in degrading conditions, and expected to perform free labor.   Bonded child labor is neither inevitable nor insurmountable. But it requires political will at all levels of the Indian government. This is where international aid donors can make a significant difference.   They should press the Indian government, especially the Ministry of Labor, to enforce its laws. In the areas where they fund schools and other programs for former child workers, donors should insist that local governments enforce the law.   Otherwise their programs will not reach the children who need them most those, like Nallanayaki, working to repay a debt that will probably be passed on to their children.

Spotlights Child Soldiers","","01/30/2003","(New York) - Governments and armed groups using child soldiers are under new scrutiny by the U.N. Security Council and must take immediate action to end child recruitment, Human Rights Watch said today.   Following a full-day debate on children and armed conflict on January 14, the Security Council today adopted a range of measures demanding accountability from parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children as soldiers.   """"Governments and armed groups using child soldiers have been put on notice,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"The Security Council is demanding concrete progress in ending the use of children in war.""""   At the Security Council's request, a report submitted at the end of 2002 by the Secretary General for the first time included an explicit list of parties to armed conflict that recruit or use children in violation of their international obligations. This list, limited to situations on the Security Council's agenda, included parties to conflict in Afghanistan, Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Liberia and Somalia. The report also mentioned the use of child soldiers in several countries not on the Security Council's agenda, including Burma, Colombia, Sri Lanka and Uganda.   Today, the Security Council took several additional steps. It:  Stated that the Security Council and/or the Secretary General will enter into dialogue with parties to armed conflict that are recruiting or using child soldiers in order to develop """"clear and time bound action plans"""" to end the practice; Called on parties to armed conflict named in a special annex to the Secretary General's report (which includes 23 parties to armed conflict in Afghanistan, Burundi, the DRC, Liberia and Somalia) to provide information on steps they have taken to end the recruitment or use of child soldiers; Requested the Secretary General to report by October 31 on progress made by parties to armed conflict that recruit or use child soldiers in violation of their international obligations. This progress report applies to both the five countries on the Secretary General's annex and the other parties named in the Secretary General's report, including Burma, Colombia, Sri Lanka and others; Said it would consider additional measures, which it did not specify, in cases where insufficient progress is made.   """"Governments and groups that fail to end the use of child soldiers should face clear consequences,"""" said Becker. """"The Security Council should use its authority to impose arms embargoes and other targeted sanctions against continuing offenders.""""   Human Rights Watch noted that while large-scale demobilizations of child soldiers have taken place in Sierra Leone and Sudan, children continue to be recruited and used in armed conflict in at least twenty countries around the world. Situations of particular concern include:  Burma, which is believed to have the largest number of child soldiers in the world. An investigation by Human Rights Watch last year found widespread forced recruitment of boys as young as 11 by Burma's national army, as well as recruitment by armed opposition groups; Northern Uganda, where over the past 15 years, the rebel Lord's Resistance Army has abducted between 10,000 and 16,000 children from northern Uganda to serve as soldiers. Abductions have sharply increased in recent months as a result of a Ugandan military offensive against the LRA; Colombia, where guerrilla and government-linked paramilitaries have engaged thousands of children in the country's long-running civil war; and Sri Lanka, where the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam allegedly continue to recruit both boys and girls, despite numerous agreements to end the use of child soldiers.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Colombia, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Liberia, Somalia, Uganda, Afghanistan, Myanmar (Burma), Sri Lanka, Global","Children's Rights, United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/01/27/better-white-night-trojan-horse","Better a White Night Than a Trojan Horse","Better a White Night Than a Trojan Horse","","01/27/2003","Last week's controversy over Libya's election as chair of the UN Commission on Human Rights put a spotlight on the crisis facing the world's leading human rights body. The commission plays a critical role in developing human rights treaties, investigating human rights abuses and naming and shaming some of the worst offenders. But over the past few years repressive governments have flocked to join the commission, intent on blocking criticism of each other and white-anting the international human rights system. In this context, the election of Australia as the commission's vice-chair should be good news. Australia returns to the UN body after an absence of six years and was the Western group of countries' choice for the bureau that will oversee the next session when it convenes in Geneva in mid March.   Australia has done a lot for the human rights cause over the years, including helping to draft the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and bring the commission into being. But given its deteriorating record on human rights and its hostile attitude to international scrutiny, Australia might well prove to be a wolf in sheep's clothing.   You only need to look at Australia's performance during the past year on key human rights issues. In its overblown response to the unauthorised arrival of asylum-seekers, Australia has adopted some of the most radical and draconian measures of any country in the industrialised world, setting terrible precedents that threaten to undermine the system of refugee protection worldwide. Canberra has not only subcontracted out these policies to its Pacific neighbours, but has aggressively promoted them internationally, even questioning the basis of the refugee convention. Australia is one of the only industrialised countries not to have issued an open invitation to the UN's human rights experts and investigative bodies. The Howard Government is still smarting from criticism of its immigration detention regime by the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and an envoy of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights during visits to Australia last year. Following censure of its treatment of indigenous people by the UN's Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Australia effectively suspended its co-operation and began an international campaign to revamp the UN's human rights treaty monitoring system. To be sure, the expert committees overseeing governments' performance are hopelessly overstretched, but Australia's reform proposals seem more intent on giving governments an easier ride than on strengthening accountability. Australia joined the ranks of some of the most abusive governments -including China, Cuba, Iran and Sudan - in opposing the adoption of a new treaty for the prevention of torture. The Optional Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, which was adopted by an overwhelming majority in November, will establish an international system for the inspection of places of detention. Although Australia ultimately had the grace to abstain in the final vote, it fought against the protocol tooth and nail, perhaps fearful of opening the doors of its immigration detention centres. And Australia can be relied on to do the dirty work for Washington on many important human rights issues at the commission and elsewhere. Australia initially stood up to US pressure in deciding to join the International Criminal Court last June. But since then it has been negotiating a side deal with the US that would grant immunity to US personnel in the unlikely event Australia was ever asked to hand them over to the court. The US has been leaning on all its allies for impunity agreements of this kind, but Australia looks set to be the first Western nation to crack. Australia is no Libya when it comes to human rights, but it shouldn't be assumed to be a white knight either. The prominent role Australia has now assumed will be a test of its human rights commitments. It should show that it will stand up to human rights abusers such as Libya, which want to subvert the commission. It should speak out and vote to condemn serious abusers such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, which deserve censure for their terrible human rights record, no matter how powerful or strategically important they may be. And it should clean up its own human rights act, starting with its atrocious treatment of asylum-seekers. This should start with a standing invitation to the UN's human rights monitors to visit Australia and investigate these concerns. With Libya elected as chair, the onus will be on Australia to counter some of the damage already done to the international human rights system. Here is a chance for Canberra to restore its battered international reputation when it comes to human rights.

The 85-page report, """"Small Change: Bonded Child Labor in India's Silk Industry,""""calls on the Indian government to implement its national laws to free and rehabilitate these """"bonded children."""" Bound to their employers in exchange for a loan to their families, they are unable to leave while in debt and earn so little they may never be free. A majority of them are Dalits, so-called untouchables at the bottom of India's caste system. """"The Indian government claims there are no bonded children in India,"""" said Zama Coursen-Neff, counsel to Human Rights Watch's children's rights division. """"In fact, they're everywhere. They are easy to find."""" Human Rights Watch interviewed children, employers, government officials and members of nongovernmental organizations in three states that form the core of India's sari and silk industries: Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. At every stage of the silk industry, bonded children as young as five years old work 12 or more hours a day, six and a half or seven days a week. Children making silk thread dip their hands in boiling water that burns and blisters them. They breathe smoke and fumes from machinery, handle dead worms that cause infections, and guide twisting threads that cut their fingers. As they assist weavers, children sit at cramped looms in damp, dim rooms. They do not go to school and are often beaten by their employers. By the time they reach adulthood, they are impoverished, illiterate, and often crippled by the work, the report said. Human Rights Watch first investigated bonded child labor in India in 1996. Since then, the Supreme Court made rehabilitation of child workers a legal requirement, and India's National Human Rights Commission has successfully pressured some local governments to act. """"The government has taken a number of steps in the right direction since our first investigation. The National Human Rights Commission's involvement is especially encouraging,"""" Coursen-Neff said. """"However, many of the small improvements are now being rolled back."""" High-level government officials interviewed by Human Rights Watch denied that children were bonded or work in factories; they claimed to have therefore shifted their focus to raising public awareness about child labor, instead of freeing children and prosecuting employers. """"Most government efforts never reached beyond high-profile industries like carpets and beedi cigarettes,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"Instead of living up to its promises, the Indian government is starting to backtrack, claiming the problem is being solved. Our research shows that it is not."""" Human Rights Watch also urged the government to recognize and address the connection between caste and bondage. Coursen-Neff pointed out that caste-based violence and discrimination, not just poverty, keep many Dalit families in bondage. """"Caste is one of the foundations of the bonded labor system,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"Dalits are denied access to land, forced to work in degrading conditions, and expected to perform free labor. Upper-caste communities inflict violence and economic boycotts on Dalits who challenge their expected social roles, keeping Dalit families in bondage and a perpetual state of poverty."""" Human Rights Watch called on international donors to pressure the national and state governments in India to enforce the child labor and bonded labor laws. International donors are increasingly funding some schools for former child workers. """"Funding schools is important, but international donors should do more,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"Donors must pressure the Indian government to enforce its own laws to free bonded children. Otherwise, schools won't reach children who can't leave work voluntarily-those who are working under force."""" Human Rights Watch also called on the national and state governments to greatly expand cooperation with nongovernmental organizations to address the problem of bonded child labor. Major Silk States: Karnataka, in the south, is India's primary producer of silk thread. There, production still depends on bonded children. Most are under age 14 and are Dalit or Muslim. In 2001, the state government promulgated an ambitious plan to eliminate all child labor, but it was not in operation at the time of Human Rights Watch's investigation one year later. A nine-year-old boy bonded in Karnataka told Human Rights Watch: """"At work the supervisor used to beat me with a belt. He tied me up and beat me with a belt on my back. He did this two or three times. . . . He tied a chain that was attached to the wall to my leg. . . . [The owner beat me] if I didn't do my work properly."""" In the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, most attention has been paid to child labor in the carpet industry, not silk. While bonded child labor in carpets has not been eliminated, vigilance from the National Human Rights Commission and pressure from domestic and international activists has provoked the government to better enforce the law and to provide schools and other social services. Much less attention has been paid to silk weaving, where child labor that was in factories has been pushed into individual homes. A 14 year-old boy who worked as a weaver's assistant in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, told Human Rights Watch that he could not leave his loom owner because he was paying off a loan, which in two years he had only reduced from Rs. 2,500 (U.S. $52) to Rs. 475 (U.S. $9.90). """"The owner pays [a small salary] but deducts for the advance [loan],"""" he said. """"He deducts but won't write off the whole advance. . . . We only make enough to eat."""" In Tamil Nadu in the south, which has successfully identified more bonded laborers than any other state, most state initiatives have focused on children working in match and fireworks manufacture. However, the state government has simply abandoned Supreme Court-mandated rehabilitation of child workers for those children found after 1997, in clear violation of the court's order. In Kanchipuram district, a major silk sari weaving area in Tamil Nadu, child bondage flourishes openly. A 13 year-old girl working in a silk weaving factory in Kanchipuram told Human Rights Watch: """"Always [the weavers and owners] are beating me-I don't like to work. They always scold and shout. They beat me on the back and head. They are always knocking their fists on my head or hitting me with a comb [wood piece in the loom]. . . . We don't play at all."""" Silk thread and silk fabric are also produced in other states in India. In addition to India, Human Rights Watch has also investigated bonded labor in Pakistan and Japan and has advocated for prosecution of offenders and rehabilitation of bonded laborers in Nepal and Sri Lanka.","India","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/01/23/letter-president-lucio-gutierrez-ecuador","Letter to President Lucio Gutirrez of Ecuador","Letter to President Lucio Gutiérrez of Ecuador","","01/23/2003","Human Rights Watch congratulates you as you assume Ecuador's presidency. We are heartened that you have publicly declared your commitment to the protection of human rights and hope that such a commitment will include a focus on the rights of workers. We urge you, in particular, to initiate meaningful labor law reforms, improve labor law enforcement, and increase protection for labor rights throughout the country. Human Rights Watch is an independent, nongovernmental organization that conducts investigations of human rights abuses in some seventy countries around the world. Human Rights Watch was founded in 1978 and today includes regional and thematic divisions, among them the Americas Division and the Business and Human Rights Program. In April 2002, Human Rights Watch published a report documenting labor rights abuses in Ecuador's banana sector, Tainted Harvest: Child Labor and Obstacles to Organization on Ecuador's Banana Plantations. As you know, the previous administration in Ecuador recently took several positive first steps towards upholding workers' rights. In October 2002, ex-Minister of Labor Martín Insua Chang decreed a new """"System for the Inspection and Monitoring of Child Labor."""" In the fall of 2002, the National Committee for the Progressive Elimination of Child Labor established a special banana sector committee to facilitate the implementation of the July 2002 banana industry agreement on child labor. And on January 3, 2003, the new Code for Children and Adolescents was published in the Official Register, raising the minimum age of employment to fifteen, increasing the maximum fine for violating child labor laws, and providing for the closure of facilities that repeatedly violate those laws. In October, the former administration also made labor-rights related commitments prior to receiving tariff benefits under the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act (ATPDEA), which requires the U.S. government to consider whether a potential beneficiary country """"provide[s] internationally recognized worker rights."""" In the view of Human Rights Watch, however, existing measures will be insufficient to address the problem of child labor in Ecuador. Similarly, ATPDEA commitments, unless interpreted broadly and rigorously implemented, will have little practical impact on improving conditions for Ecuador's workers. Human Rights Watch strongly encourages your administration to go beyond previous initiatives and adopt the reforms necessary for the immediate elimination of harmful child labor and the progressive elimination of all child labor-an ATPDEA commitment. We urge you to ensure that the System for the Inspection and Monitoring of Child Labor provides for the hiring of new child labor inspectors, at least one for each province as required by Ecuadorian law, rather than the transfer of existing inspectors. Additional funding should be allocated to ensure that the System has sufficient resources to complete its functions, including gathering, processing, and updating data on child labor. Similarly, the National Committee for the Progressive Elimination of Child Labor's banana sector committee, which according to ex-Minister of Labor Insua has only four inspectors to monitor over 5,000 plantations, requires more inspectors for meaningful implementation of the banana industry's agreement. As enforcement of child labor laws improves, it is also imperative that rehabilitative mechanisms for displaced child workers be established and effectively administered. To these ends, Human Rights Watch recommends that your administration adopt a strategy for the progressive elimination of child labor that includes not only enforcing the increased penalties for violating child labor laws but requires that a portion of the fines collected be dedicated to rehabilitation of former child workers; the implementation of the provisions of the Constitution and Code for Children and Adolescents that mandate free and compulsory education for all children under fifteen; and a meaningful increase in programs for social protection for at-risk children and displaced child workers, such as scholarships and health and food subsidies. So that these children's parents, whose meager incomes exacerbate the problem of child labor, and all Ecuadorian workers can exercise their right to organize and bargain collectively for higher wages and better working conditions, Human Rights Watch urges your administration to take the necessary steps to give effect to Ecuador's obligations under International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize and ILO Convention 98 concerning the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining. Human Rights Watch urges your administration to uphold its ATPDEA commitment to review the consistency of Ecuador's labor laws with the country's obligations under ILO conventions, particularly in the area of freedom of association. Human Rights Watch has documented that Ecuadorian labor laws governing the right to organize fall significantly short of international standards. For example, in large part due to weak labor protections and even weaker enforcement of existing laws, workers in Ecuador's banana sector are the victims of severe anti-union discrimination, which is reflected in a union affiliation rate of less than 1 percent-a banana worker affiliation rate far lower than that of Colombia or any Central American banana-exporting country. Human Rights Watch encourages your administration to push for legislation to remedy these shortcomings. In particular, Human Rights Watch recommends that labor law reforms be enacted that explicitly prohibit employers from interfering in the establishment or functioning of workers' organizations; require reinstatement of workers fired for engaging in union activity and payment of lost wages during the period of wrongful dismissal; prohibit anti-union discrimination in hiring and establish adequate penalties to deter employers from engaging in this or any other anti-union discrimination; allow subcontracted workers to organize and bargain collectively with the person or company that, in practice, has the power to dictate their employment terms and conditions; limit the percentage of subcontracted workers in any workplace to 20 percent; and reduce the minimum number of workers required to form a union from thirty to the previous minimum of fifteen. If these amendments are adopted and effectively enforced, workers in Ecuador will be significantly closer to being able to exercise their right to organize. One of last year's most troubling examples of anti-union activity in Ecuador occurred on the Los Alamos banana plantations owned by the Noboa Corporation. Since workers began organizing in February 2002 and, to a greater extent, after they declared a strike in March and implemented that strike declaration in May, they have been the victims of systematic anti-union conduct. Workers have suffered retaliatory dismissals, threats and intimidation to withdraw support for unions and negotiating demands, and employer interference in the establishment and functioning of workers' organizations. They have also been the victims of gross acts of anti-union violence; on May 16, at least nine striking workers were shot and injured and many more were dragged from their homes by armed thugs. Ecuador made an ATPDEA-commitment to establish a high-level commission to examine the police response to the striking Los Alamos workers, the conduct of the parties to the arbitration and reconciliation process that addressed the labor conflict, and the procedures for handling strikers' complaints of labor law violations. Human Rights Watch urges your administration to ensure that the high-level commission is not only established but undertakes its mission diligently and seriously. If violations of Ecuadorian law are suspected, the commission should turn those matters over to the proper authorities for their immediate investigation and, if appropriate, sanction. If improper procedures were followed by government agents, the necessary steps should be taken to ensure that the offending agents face proper consequences and that the victims of improper conduct are compensated. Lastly, Human Rights Watch calls on your administration to undertake a comprehensive criminal investigation of the anti-union violence committed against the Los Alamos workers on May 16. Anyone found responsible for the violence should be prosecuted. We note that the previous investigation, which was undertaken and turned over to a criminal judge in October 2002, was sorely inadequate. That investigation overlooked one of the two incidents of violence; examined the case of the injured policeman but not the injured workers; named sixteen accused, though worker reports allege that roughly two hundred men were involved; and failed to include information from workers, strongly suggesting that none were interviewed. Unless another investigation is initiated, those who may have contracted the perpetrators of the violence as well as all but sixteen of those perpetrators will enjoy impunity, and the sixteen accused will face charges for only a fraction of the illegal activities of May 16, enjoying impunity with respect to the others. As a condition for receiving ATPDEA benefits, Ecuador committed to continue to investigate and take further action with respect to this case. Human Rights Watch urges your administration not only to facilitate the advancement of the case underway but to open a new, meaningful investigation of the events. Given your long-standing commitment to Ecuador's workers, the poor, and the disenfranchised, we are confident that your administration will place respect for labor rights among its highest priorities and will seriously consider adopting the aforementioned recommendations for the improvement of workers' rights. We are hopeful that your administration will make significant progress in this area and look forward to discussing these matters further during your term.

Men may no longer teach women or girls in private classes. Girls and boys are no longer allowed to be in school buildings at the same time. The effect of the ban will be to block many women and girls from attending private courses. There is a shortage of women teachers; almost all the teachers in private courses are men. The new rules are especially cruel now. Many women and girls are studying hard to make up for the six years lost under the Taliban. They have been using private classes in English, computers and basic subjects to supplement formal schooling. The order has created a local uproar. As one Afghan woman said, """"It is a very strong kind of discrimination against women getting education."""" She was resentful of the authorities' suspicions. """"All the time they suspect girls of immorality,"""" she said. Unfortunately, the situation in Herat is not unique. All over Afghanistan, especially outside the capital, progress on female education is being compromised by the behavior of ultra-conservative local leaders, allies of the U.S.-led coalition in the war against the Taliban. They used their connections to the United States to seize power but then embraced some of the Taliban's most odious restrictions. Hundreds of thousands of girls and women have returned to schools and universities across the country. But """"only the doors to the schools are open,"""" a young women in Herat told us. """"Everything else is restricted."""" Even education is now under assault. In the north and east, girls' schools have been burned or shelled (luckily, when closed). Leaders in some southern provinces have allowed police forces to threaten women and girls going to school. Pamphlets have been secretly distributed warning families against sending their daughters to school. Attacks on female education are linked to the growing power of fundamentalist groups. In many areas, police are imposing supposedly Islamic rules on women and girls, many of which appall ordinary Afghans. Officials in the north and west have pressured women not to work for foreign organizations. Herat police have forced women to wear the all-encompassing burqa and have subjected women and girls seen with unrelated men to forced """"chastity"""" examinations at the local hospital. Local police in several areas near Kabul have shut down wedding parties for playing music, harassed shopkeepers selling music or movies, and beaten up musicians. Donor countries involved in Afghanistan should increase their pressure on the Afghan warlords to stop targeting women and girls. The right to education, and women's rights generally, should be emphasized by donors as Afghanistan's new constitution is drafted and then elections are held in 2004. Donors should make sure that Afghan women's groups get adequate support and funding, not just in Kabul but throughout the country. Women and girls must have the right to use their education: to work, speak publicly about the government and women's rights, and participate in the decisions that affect them.

General al-Majid arrived in Damascus, Syria, today for talks with President Bashar al-Assad, reportedly as part of efforts to avert a possible war against Iraq. According to press reports, he may also visit Egypt, Jordan and Lebanon in the coming days.  Al-Majid commanded Iraq's notorious """"Anfal"""" campaign, which resulted in the murder and """"disappearance"""" of some 100,000 Kurds and was marked by the use of chemical weapons, according to a Human Rights Watch book on that campaign, Genocide In Iraq: The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds.Al-Majid is widely known in Iraq as """"Chemical Ali"""" for his repeated use of outlawed chemical warfare. He was later in charge of Iraq's brutal military occupation of Kuwait.  """"Al-Majid is Saddam Hussein's hatchet man. He has been involved in some of Iraq's worst crimes -- including genocide and crimes against humanity,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Bringing him to justice is an essential priority.""""  Who is Ali Hassan al-Majid? Ali Hassan al-Majid, as secretary general of the Northern Bureau of Iraq's Ba'th Party, held authority over all agencies of the state in the Kurdish region from March 1987 to April 1989, including the 1st and 5th Corps of the army, the General Security Directorate, and Military Intelligence. This included the period of the """"Anfal"""" genocide against the region's Kurdish residents. One of his orders, dated June 20, 1987, directed army commanders """"to carry out special bombardments [a reference to chemical weapon use]...to kill the largest number of persons present in...prohibited zones.""""  Named after a Koranic verse, justifying pillage of properties of infidels, the """"Anfal"""" campaign unfolded as the 1980-1988 Iran/Iraq war was winding down. The Anfal campaign, under al-Majid's command, resulted in the murder and """"disappearance"""" of some 100,000 noncombatants, the use of chemical weapons against non-combatants in dozens of locations, and the near-total destruction of family and community assets, including agricultural and other infrastructure, throughout the rural Kurdish areas. Documents captured from Iraqi intelligence services demonstrate that the mass killings, """"disappearances,"""" forced displacement, and other crimes were carried out in a coherent and highly centralized manner under al-Majid's direct supervision. Ali Hassan al-Majid was subsequently in charge of Iraq's military occupation of Kuwait and led forces that suppressed the popular uprising in the south of the country in March 1991. All of these campaigns were marked by executions, arbitrary arrests, """"disappearances,"""" torture and other atrocities.

Similarly, under the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, which Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria have ratified, these governments undertook to prevent and to punish acts of genocide. Finally, all four countries have ratified the Geneva Conventions, which prescribes that states parties must search for persons alleged to have committed war crimes, and bring such persons, regardless of their nationality, before their own courts.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt, Iraq, Syria","International Justice"

Commission Needs Membership Criteria ","01/16/2003","The likely election of Libya to a key United Nations post on Monday will put a spotlight on its human rights record and on efforts by abusive governments to undermine the international human rights system, Human Rights Watch said today. Libya looks certain to be elected chairman of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the world’s top human rights forum whose annual six-week session will take place in Geneva in March and April. The Africa regional group has nominated Libya to chair the commission on a rotational basis. Some governments, including the United States, have opposed Libya's nomination and may call for a vote to signal their indignation, but no alternative candidate is likely to emerge by January 20, when the commission holds its preparatory meeting in Geneva.  The commission, which “names and shames” abusive governments, has grown more timid in recent years as countries with poor human rights records have vied to become members so they can block their own censure.  “Libya’s election poses a real test for the commission,” said Joanna Weschler, U.N. representative of Human Rights Watch. “Repressive governments must not be allowed to hijack the U.N. human rights system.”  Weschler urged that countries seeking election to the commission should meet the following minimum criteria:  ratify the main human rights treaties, fulfill obligations to provide reports on their compliance with conventions already ratified, issue a standing invitation to U.N. investigators, and not have been condemned by the commission in the recent past.“No country has a perfect human rights record,” said Weschler, “but every member should at least show a real commitment to cooperating with United Nations on human rights.”  Over the past three decades, Libya’s human rights record has been appalling. It has included the abduction, forced disappearance or assassination of political opponents; torture and mistreatment of detainees; and long-term detention without charge or trial or after grossly unfair trials. Today hundreds of people remain arbitrarily detained, some for over a decade, and there are serious concerns about treatment in detention and the fairness of procedures in several on-going high profile trials before the Peoples’ Courts. Libya has been a closed country for United Nations and non-governmental human rights investigators.  Since its nomination by the African Union, Libya has indicated that it would invite U.N. investigators and international human rights groups to visit Libya. It has declared its intention to review the role of the grossly unfair Peoples’ Courts, with a view to abolishing them, and announced several amnesties for prisoners.  While welcoming those initiatives as important indicators of Libya’s intentions, Human Rights Watch called on Libya to formally issue a standing invitation to all the U.N. human rights monitoring bodies, following in the footsteps of forty-one member states that have done so already, and to promptly submit its outstanding reports to the U.N. treaty bodies.  “The Libyans have made some positive commitments in their election bid, but these should be put into practice before they take over the chairmanship,” Weschler said.  Critical issues at this year’s session will include the impact of the war against terrorism on human rights and the continuing grave human rights situations in Chechnya, China, Israel and the Occupied Territories, and Iran.

The 75-page report, """"‘We'll Kill You If You Cry:' Sexual Violence in the Sierra Leone Conflict,"""" presents evidence of horrific abuses against women and girls in every region of the country by the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF), as well as other rebel, government and international peacekeeping forces.   """"In this report, we have documented unimaginable atrocities against women in Sierra Leone,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division at Human Rights Watch. """"The people responsible for these crimes must be held accountable."""" Takirambudde also said the victims of sexual violence urgently need help to regain their health and reintegrate into their communities.   The Human Rights Watch report, which is based on hundreds of interviews with victims, witnesses and officials, details crimes of sexual violence committed primarily by soldiers of various rebel forces - the RUF, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC), and the West Side Boys. The report also examines sexual violence by government forces and militias, as well as international peacekeepers.   Throughout the armed conflict in Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2001, thousands of women and girls of all ages, ethnic groups, and socioeconomic classes were subjected to widespread and systematic sexual violence, including individual and gang rape, and rape with objects such as weapons, firewood, umbrellas and pestles. These crimes of sexual violence were generally characterized by extraordinary brutality and frequently preceded or followed by other egregious human rights abuses against the victim, her family and her community. The rebels abducted many women and girls, who were subjected to sexual violence as well as being forced to perform housework, farm work and serve as military porters.   The rebels sought to dominate women and their communities by deliberately undermining cultural values and community relationships, destroying the ties that hold society together. Child combatants raped women who were old enough to be their grandmothers, rebels raped pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, and fathers were forced to watch their daughters being raped.   To date there has been no accountability for the thousands of crimes of sexual violence or other appalling human rights abuses committed during the war in Sierra Leone.   """"The war in Sierra Leone became infamous for the amputation of hands and arms,"""" said Takirambudde. """"Rape may not be visible in the same way, but it is every bit as devastating.""""   The United Nations has established a Special Court for Sierra Leone (SCSL) and a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) to investigate human rights violations committed by all parties during the war. Human Rights Watch has urged both the SCSL and TRC to make sexual violence and sexual slavery a top priority, and investigate and prosecute gender-related crimes as crimes against humanity or war crimes.   Human Rights Watch also urged that the domestic legal system be revised to ensure that crimes of sexual violence are prosecuted in a sensitive manner.   The lack of attention to conflict-related sexual violence means that few assistance programs have been established for women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence, including sexual slavery. Survivors not only live with the severe physical and mental health consequences of the abuses suffered, but also fear ongoing non-conflict-related sexual violence, largely perpetrated with impunity. International donors and nongovernmental organizations should work together with the government of Sierra Leone to establish programs (health care, education, adult literacy, skills training, trauma counseling and income-generating schemes) that will help to rehabilitate the survivors of sexual violence.","Africa, Sierra Leone","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/01/15/not-way-fight-terrorism","Not the Way to Fight Terrorism","Not the Way to Fight Terrorism","Neglecting Human Rights","01/15/2003","NEW YORK: The United States, as a major target, has taken the lead in combating terrorism. But the global outpouring of sympathy that followed the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, is giving way to growing resentment of the United States and reluctance to join the fight. How was this goodwill depleted so quickly? Part of the reason lies in how terrorism is being fought. Because terrorism is antithetical to human rights, the values of human rights should be understood as an antidote to the view that attacking civilians is legitimate, that the ends justify the means. But in too many places the Bush administration sees human rights not as an essential tool in its fight against terrorism but as an obstacle. That is dangerously counterproductive. It undermines the public support needed to defeat terrorism.   Curbing terrorism requires the help of people in countries where terrorists reside. They are the ones who must cooperate with police inquiries rather than shield terrorist activity. They must take the lead in dissuading would-be terrorists. But if they see Washington embracing governments that repress them, they hardly feel inclined to lend their support.   In Pakistan, for example, General Pervez Musharraf has entrenched military rule. But when asked about this trend, President George W. Bush said, """"My reaction about President Musharraf, he's still tight with us on the war against terror, and that's what I appreciate."""" Not surprisingly, anti-American political parties were the big winners in Pakistan's recent parliamentary elections. In post-Taliban Afghanistan, the Bush administration has refused to provide active support to an expanded international peacekeeping force. Instead, outside Kabul, it is trying to buy security on the cheap by allying itself with abusive warlords such as Ismail Khan. The Herat-based warlord has used death threats, detention and torture to stamp out all dissent, muzzle the press and bundle women back into their burqas. In Indonesia, the abusive military has been a large factor driving people toward violent extremism. But the Bush administration is pressing to reinvigorate ties with the military despite the lack of accountability for its serious abuses and its support for militia groups which foster instability. The Bush administration even opposed a civil suit brought in a U.S. court on behalf of victims of military atrocities, ostensibly because it might discourage Indonesia from cooperating in the war on terrorism. The same pattern arises in America's own treatment of terrorist suspects. The Bush administration has unjustifiably rejected the Geneva conventions for prisoners from the war in Afghanistan. It has misused the """"enemy combatant"""" designation for criminal suspects at home. It has reportedly used """"stress and duress"""" interrogation techniques. It has threatened to use substandard military tribunals. It has abused immigration laws to deny criminal suspects their rights. The Bush administration is fighting terrorism as if human rights were not a constraint. At the global level, the administration seeks universal enforcement of laws against terrorism but opposes enforcement of universal human rights norms. It has declared a virtual war on the International Criminal Court. It tried to block creation of an international inspection regime to prevent torture. It opposed a United Nations resolution on the need to fight against terrorism consistently with respect of human rights. America, of course, is far from the worst offender. But because of America's extraordinary influence, the Bush administration's willingness to compromise human rights while fighting terrorism sets a dangerous precedent. It will not work for the Bush administration to be only against terrorism. It will have to stand for the values that explain what is wrong with attacking civilians - the values of human rights. There have been hints of such a positive vision, such as in the administration's National Security Strategy. But this rhetorical embrace of human rights has translated only inconsistently into U.S. policy. Clearly America and its allies must take extra security measures. But an anti-terrorism policy that ignores human rights is a gift to the terrorists. A successful anti-terrorism policy must endeavor to build strong international human rights norms and institutions, not provide a new rationale for avoiding and undermining them.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan, Pakistan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2003/01/05/justice-and-war-against-terrorism","Justice and the War against Terrorism","Justice and the 'War' against Terrorism","Beyond the Law","01/05/2003","Where should we draw the line between war and law enforcement in the fight against terrorism? When is it appropriate to track down and kill terrorist suspects or detain them summarily, and when must they be brought before the criminal justice system? Three American actions over the last year prompt those questions: the killing of an Al Qaeda suspect in Yemen, the detention without charge or trial of an alleged enemy combatant in Chicago, and the flouting of a judicial order against removing terrorist suspects from Bosnia. The questions arise because the geographic scope of the campaign against terrorism is potentially so expansive. Traditional armed conflict occurs on a reasonably circumscribed battlefield. But US President George Bush has said that the ‘war’ against terrorism might extend to some sixty countries. Are terrorist suspects in all of these enemy combatants?  The designation matters because it affects the tools that can be used to counter terrorism. If a person is a criminal suspect, he can be arrested and prosecuted. International human rights law permits the use of lethal force against a criminal suspect only if necessary to stop an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury. But if a person is an enemy combatant, the law of war permits him to be killed summarily, so long as he is not in custody, incapacitated, or surrendering. There is no duty to attempt to arrest or subdue him. If an enemy combatant is detained, the law of war permits him to be held until the end of the armed conflict, without the need to charge or try him. Summary Justice So how do we decide where war ends and law enforcement begins? The law of aggression permits a government to take up arms in self-defence, as the US did following the attacks of September 11 2001. Few would quarrel with Washington’s right to pursue Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and deprive it of that territorial base of operations. But does the right of military response extend beyond that traditional battlefield? For example, US officials charge that Al Qaeda operatives have used London’s Finsbury Park mosque as a recruiting ground. Assuming that the British government consented, does that give the US the right to kill suspects operating there, or to detain them without charge or trial? Most people would probably have qualms about such action. But if Al Qaeda operatives anywhere in the world are enemy combatants, America would be within its rights to shoot or detain them summarily. America might similarly attack suspected Al Qaeda cells in Hamburg, where several of the September 11 hijackers lived, or even in Buffalo, New York where an alleged Al Qaeda cell was recently exposed. Indeed, assuming it secured the consent of local governments, Pentagon forces might circle the globe taking out enemy operatives or detaining them without due process. Such an expansive understanding of US war powers would threaten to overturn decades of effort to build and extend criminal justice guarantees that protect us all from abusive state power. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial – let alone the right to avoid the death penalty – would give way to Washington’s unilateral decision that a suspect was an enemy combatant who could be summarily killed or detained.  That consequence may be unavoidable on the traditional battlefield. Ugly as it is, war gives combatants the right to kill or detain each other. But is war the right way to conceive of the global fight against Al Qaeda, let alone the war against terrorism? Beyond traditional battlefields such as Afghanistan and perhaps western Pakistan, is the war against terrorism a genuine armed conflict? Or is it a rhetorical war – a useful device to drum up public support for an important law enforcement effort, but not a justification for suspending criminal justice guarantees?  Justice First In the campaign against terrorism, governments should not use war powers where law enforcement is possible. Military force might be justified to combat a serious threat from a lawless land, or from a country whose government refuses to cooperate in meeting the threat. But war rules should not apply when there is a reasonable option of arresting and prosecuting a suspect. That is the only way to avoid creating a huge loophole in our human rights and due process guarantees. This principle permits us to examine the propriety of various US actions in fighting terrorism. In November, for example, the Central Intelligence Agency used a missile to kill Ali Qaed Senyan al-Harthi, an alleged senior Al Qaeda official, as he drove in a remote and lawless area of Yemen controlled by tribal chiefs. Washington accused al-Harthi of masterminding the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole which killed seventeen sailors. Based on the limited information available, Human Rights Watch did not criticise the attack on al-Harthi as an extra-judicial execution because his alleged Al Qaeda role arguably made him an enemy combatant, the government apparently lacked control over the area in question, and there was evidently no reasonable law enforcement alternative. Indeed, eighteen Yemeni soldiers reportedly lost their lives in a previous attempt to arrest him.  So far, the United States is not known to have used lethal force outside Afghanistan, Pakistan and the al-Harthi incident. However, Washington has resisted articulating the limits to its war powers. Insight into how expansively it views these powers can be gained from its actions in summarily detaining other Al Qaeda suspects. A good illustration is the case of Jose Padilla, a US citizen whom the Bush administration claimed had flown from Pakistan to Chicago’s O’Hare airport in May to investigate creating a radiological bomb. Instead of charging him with this serious criminal offence and bringing him to trial, he was seized at the airport and then unilaterally declared an enemy combatant. That designation, it was claimed, permitted him to be held without access to counsel and without charge or trial until the end of the war against terrorism, which may never come. Should Padilla have been classified an enemy combatant? If he was merely a criminal suspect, and since all agree he posed no imminent threat, at most he could have been arrested, charged and tried. But if he came to wage war as an enemy combatant, as the administration claims, he could have been shot in cold blood in the airport terminal rather than detained.  Most people would probably feel uncomfortable were Padilla to have been summarily shot – because most people believe governments should not rely on military force when a criminal justice system is available. But if we are reluctant to start summarily shooting terrorist suspects when they can easily be arrested, we should also be reluctant to designate them as enemy combatants to deny them their right to be charged and tried in a court of law.  Seizing suspects In October 2001, Washington sought the surrender of six Algerians suspected of planning attacks on Americans in Bosnia. After a three-month investigation, Bosnia’s Supreme Court ordered the men to be released from custody because of a lack of evidence. When rumours spread of US efforts to seize the suspects anyway, Bosnia’s Human Rights Chamber issued an injunction against their removal. Yet in January last year, under pressure from Washington, the Bosnian government ignored this legal ruling and delivered the men to American forces. They were then whisked out of the country, reportedly to the detention centre in Guantanamo Bay. There was no allegation that law enforcement options were unavailable in Bosnia. Indeed, the Human Rights Chamber was established under the US-sponsored Dayton peace accord and includes six local and eight international members. Nor did anyone allege that the Bosnian judicial system was acting politically or inappropriately. Rather, Washington simply didn’t like the results of an apparently fair assessment of the evidence it had proffered to justify arrest. The case highlights the danger to criminal justice rights if the United States can unilaterally invoke war powers far from any recognisable battlefield. Despite its importance for our due process rights, governments have avoided drawing the line between war and law enforcement. As the leader of the campaign against terrorism, Washington has no  incentive to articulate the legal limits to its actions. Indeed, it has often been contemptuous of international law on the matter. But allowing the superpower to operate outside the law degrades the international standards on which all of our rights depend. It is only too easy to imagine governments worldwide identifying their own enemy combatants when the rules of criminal justice prove inconvenient. It is time to reaffirm that even war powers must be exercised under law – before we find that some of our most fundamental rights have been compromised.","United States","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Torture, Detention without Trial"
