"https://www.hrw.org/news/1992/06/21/police-abuse-women-pakistan","Police Abuse of Women in Pakistan","Police Abuse of Women in Pakistan","","06/21/1992","(New York) - In """"Double Jeopardy: Police Abuse of Women in Pakistan,"""" released today, Asia Watch and the Women's Rights Project, two divisions of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, charge the government of Pakistan with responsibility for an epidemic of unpunished police violence against women. The 106-page report finds that more than 70 percent of women in police custody are subjected to physical and sexual abuse by law enforcement agents, yet not a single police official has been subjected to criminal penalties for such abuse.   Based in part on a two-week visit to Pakistan in October 1991, """"Double Jeopardy"""" documents repeated incidents of rape, sexual torture and physical abuse of women by law enforcement agents in Pakistan and concludes that the Pakistani government's failure to prosecute such abuse amounts to complicity in police violence and a systematic denial of equal justice to women. Asia Watch and the Women's Rights Project call on the government of Pakistan to denounce publicly the sexual and physical abuse of women by state agents, to put an end to impunity for crimes of custodial violence against women and to guarantee women equality before and equal protection of the law. Double Jeopardy concludes that Pakistani police routinely deny women basic protection due them by law. Police often refuse to register rape complaints by women, particularly if the complaint implicates an officer. Officers frequently illegally detain women in police lock-up for days at a time without formally registering a charge against them or producing them before the magistrate within the prescribed 24-hour period. Although women police officers are required to be present at the arrest and interrogation of women, this rarely occurs. Thus, women prisoners are often held in custody indefinitely by male police officers without the knowledge of the courts. Most sexual abuse of female detainees occurs in these periods of """"invisibility.""""   More than 60 percent of all female detainees are imprisoned under the Hudood Ordinances, Islamic penal laws that discriminate against women both in law and in practice. The Hudood laws criminalize, among other things, rape, adultery and fornication, and prescribe punishments for these offenses that include stoning to death and public flogging. Asia Watch and the Women's Rights Project do not object to laws founded on religion, provided that human rights are respected and the principle of equality before the law are upheld. However, the Hudood laws as written and applied clearly conflict with these rights and principles: they prescribe punishments deemed cruel and inhumane under international law and, in practice, clearly discriminate on the basis of gender.   Double Jeopardy concludes that the vast majority of Hudood cases do not comport with international standards of due process and should never have been prosecuted. For the maximum Hudood punishments of stoning to death or 100 lashes, the testimony of women carries no legal weight. Thus, women have been sentenced to these cruel and inhumane punishments under a lay that explicitly prevents them from testifying on their own behalf. Men have also been cruelly sentenced under these laws, although men accused of rape are effectively exempted from maximum punishment because women cannot testify and because it is extremely unlikely that, as required by the Hudood law, there would have been four male Muslim witnesses to the act of penetration. While to date no maximum punishments have been carried out in Pakistan, nothing in Pakistani laws impedes the state from doing so in the future.   Even when the testimony of women is admissible under the law, for lesser Hudood punishments of flogging, fines or imprisonment, the Pakistani courts continue to exhibit a bias against women. Judges set unreasonably high standards of proof for rape allegations and, in the event that a woman cannot prove rape, the courts often prosecute her for adultery or fornication, despite the fact that a failure to meet the criminal burden of proof for rape does not prove that the same burden of proof for consensual sex is automatically met. In one case documented in the report, 18-year-old Majeeda Mujid was abducted by several men and raped by them repeatedly. When Majeeda was turned over by her captors to the police and complained of rape, the police charged her with illicit sex, imprisoned her pending trial and let the men go free.   According to several local human rights attorneys who represent women charged with Hudood offenses, the vast majority of adultery and fornication charges against women (most of which are registered by the women's husband or father) are not supported with evidence. Double Jeopardy documents several cases in which women were wrongfully detained by the police and prosecuted by the courts because they refused to marry men chosen by their families, decided to leave home or marry against their parents' will, or sought to separate from or divorce abusive husbands. In lieu of filing a formal charge against a woman for adultery or fornication or for complicity in an alleged sex crime, judges often remand women without charge to private detention facilities for indefinite periods. This is viewed by the courts as """"protective custody"""" for the women, but amounts to illegal and often prolonged detention of women who are charged with no offense.   Although the acquittal rate for women in Hudood cases is estimated at over 30 percent, by the time a wrongfully prosecuted woman has been vindicated she is likely to have spent months and in some cases years in prison, often under poor conditions, and in all likelihood, having suffered sexual or physical abuse while in custody. Over 2,000 women currently are imprisoned under these laws alone.   State-sanctioned violence against women and sex-discrimination are not the exclusive lot of Pakistani women in Pakistani jails. Hundreds of Bangladeshi women are currently jailed in Pakistani and subjected to similar treatment. These women are smuggled into the country-at a rate of 100- 150 a month-and are forcibly sold into prostitution or domestic servitude. While the women are arrested by the police as illegal immigrants or for Hudood offenses, they government of Pakistan has failed to prosecute or punish a single person for trafficking in women or for the abuses commonly associated with this practice.","Asia, Pakistan","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/1992/06/01/egypt-court-upholds-closure-womens-organization","Egypt- Court Upholds Closure of Womens Organization","Egypt: Court Upholds Closure of Women's Organization","","06/01/1992","On May 7, 1992, an Egyptian administrative court decided to uphold last year's decree dissolving the Egyptian branch of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association (AWSA), a prominent women's rights organization. The court refused to grant an injunction that would have allowed AWSA to continue operating while it awaits the outcome an appeal on the merits of the government decree. After several delays, the three-judge State Council court rejected AWSA's request for an injunction, finding that the group had """"violated the rule of law and public order and morality."""" Led by renowned writer and women's rights advocate Dr. Nawal el-Saadawi, AWSA -- through both its international organization and Egyptian branch -- has focused on the social and economic advancement of women and women's participation in political life. The administrative closure order by the Egyptian authorities continued the pattern of official harassment that AWSA has faced since its formation in 1982. The court ruled that AWSA's activities did not comply with """"the general interests of the country"""" and """"damaged relations between Egypt and some foreign and Arab-sister states."""" The court also found that AWSA's activities """"threatened the peace and political and social order of the state by spreading ideas and beliefs offensive to the rule of Islamic sharia and the religion of Islam, a matter which forms a substantial violation of the law."""" In an interview with MEW last month, Dr. el-Saadawi described the ruling as """"unjust,"""" and promised continued legal appeals. The government's move to dissolve AWSA generated an international campaign of protest from human rights organizations and women's rights groups. In addition, numerous members of the U.S. Congress expressed their concern about the dissolution order to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker. The case has focused attention on Egypt's Law No. 32 of 1964, the Law of Associations and Private Foundations, which grants the Ministry of Social Affairs wide powers of control over private citizens' organizations. Egyptian lawyers and human rights advocates view the AWSA case as an example of how the government can utilize the law of associations to muzzle dissent in Egypt. Saad el-Din Ibrahim, a prominent Egyptian academic and human rights advocate, described the State Council Court's decision as a """"warning that any non-governmental organization speaking out on public issues could be penalized by administrative decree."""" * * * The Court's Ruling: Violations of Public Order and Morality The Deputy Governor of Western Cairo signed the closure order against AWSA in an administrative decree dated June 15, 1991, which provided no specific reasons for the decision. He subsequently responded to questions about the order by claiming that he had acted because of AWSA's financial and administrative infractions, implicitly deflecting criticism of the government's move as politically motivated.1 In contrast, the May 7, 1992 ruling by the State Council's Administrative Judicial Court2 used strong language to condemn AWSA for alleged violations of public morality. To support the closure decree, the court cited Article 57(4) of the law of associations, which allows the state to dissolve an association """"if it had committed a flagrant violation of the law or violated public order or morality."""" The court found that AWSA had """"violated the rule of law and public order and morality by the practice of political and religious activities through its magazine and publication.""""3 The magazine, Noun, and another publication, The Solidarity of Arab Women, """"contained attacks against and aroused suspicions of the social and religious order, especially the conventions of marriage, divorce, and the (permitted) number of wives,"""" the court found. Referring to these two publications, the court said: """"The attacks on state policy constitute an offense against the fundamental rules of association."""" The court further noted AWSA's sponsorship of a conference in September 1990 that criticized government policy on the Gulf crisis. The Women's Journalism Conference constituted """"an attack on the policy of Egypt regarding the Gulf crisis, despite the immunity granted the official state position concerning the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait,"""" the court wrote. The court also stated that AWSA had maintained two bank accounts, one for foreign use and the other for domestic use, and had unauthorized links to international organizations, in violation of the law of associations.4 AWSA's lawyers had asked the court to permit the organization to continue its activities until the court ruled on the merits of the dissolution decree, which also ordered the transfer of AWSA's assets to another women's group, Women of Islam. This welfare association, which provides housing and social services to female students from the provinces who study in Cairo, does not address women's rights issues. Only through further appeals can the Egyptian branch of AWSA recover its assets threatened with liquidation by the decree.5 The court's denial of the injunction in its May 7 ruling means that AWSA's branch in Egypt cannot operate at all, pending the outcome of a legal process that lawyers predict could drag on for several years. The law of associations prohibits a banned association from re-establishing under another name.6 AWSA: The Reasons for the Closure Are Political The court's refusal to grant an injunction does not determine the outcome of AWSA's appeal of the dissolution decree on its merits. But AWSA officials expressed concern that the court's ruling revealed its attitude toward the organization. """"We think the reasons (for AWSA's closure) are political. They are trying to say that it was administrative and that we have made mistakes, but they could have told us about these mistakes or investigated. They could have helped us to correct the mistakes if they had wanted the association, but they didn't want the association,"""" Dr. el-Saadawi told MEW.7 AWSA officials believe that the government decided to clamp down on the organization because it questioned the Egyptian administration's policy during the Gulf crisis. AWSA's September 1990 conference attempted to arrive at alternatives to the then-impending Gulf war. Conference participants voiced opposition to the Iraqi invasion and to foreign intervention in the region, advocating an approach based on diplomacy and negotiation, rather than military force and war. One AWSA representative speculated that the court's reference to AWSA's damaging impact on Egyptian foreign relations was related to the association's criticism of countries such as the United States, Israel, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia. The law of associations does not directly proscribe the discussion of either politics or religion, but it does restrict organizations to fulfilling specific limited roles; therefore, any group that the government alleges has worked outside of its defined field can be accused of violating the law. AWSA, however, has operated under a wide-ranging mandate, broad enough to be readas encompassing issues related to religion and politics. In its 1985 title of registration (No. 3282), the Ministry of Social Affairs permitted AWSA to conduct religious and educational activities. Even the court recognized that the association """"has been set up for work in the field of cultural, scholarly and religious services for women."""" In a defense memorandum, one of AWSA's lawyers pointed to its 1985 registration documents that describe its purpose as """"to elevate the cultural and educational level of Egyptian women, to discuss the problems faced by women, to raise the level of health in the family by raising the hygienic and social consciousness of women, to establish a cultural library, and to strengthen social and educational relations with Arab women.""""8 AWSA's lawyers further argued that the alleged offenses against the law of associations were activities carried out by the international division of AWSA, over which the Ministry of Social Affairs has no jurisdiction and to which the law of associations does not apply. AWSA's defense rests on the argument that the Ministry has confused the existence of the Arab Women's Solidarity Association, an international women's group with consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council since 1985, with the Egyptian branch of AWSA. Adil Amin, one of AWSA's attorneys, cited the ongoing correspondence between AWSA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' International Corporations Administration to demonstrate the Foreign Ministry's recognition of AWSA's separate international status and the distinction between AWSA's Egyptian branch and its international arm.9 Amin argued that all the activities cited by the Ministry of Social Affairs and reaffirmed by the State Council court were conducted by AWSA's international organization. The defense memorandum also stated that the association had issued its magazine Noun solely for internal publication.10 AWSA officials and the organization's attorneys pointed out that Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs had previously granted AWSA's international organization permission to convene international conferences in Cairo in 1986 and 1988. Ironically, after the dissolution order was issued on June 15, 1991, the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs -- on July 18, 1991 -- granted AWSA permission to convene yet another international conference in Cairo in November 1991, on the subject of Women, Democracy and Development in the Arab World. Notably, theMinistry's letter of permission revealed the state's power to control even minor details of an organization's activities, such as the title of an international conference. The Foreign Ministry stated that it did not object to the conference, but cautioned that """"the word democracy should be removed from its title because it may lead to the discussion of internal affairs of countries, the subjects or the representatives of which will participate in the conference."""" Doors of AWSA's Cairo Office Must Remain Shut The court's ruling last month means that the doors of AWSA's Egyptian branch must remain shut for the duration of the legal proceedings. Since the public disclosure of the administrative decree in July 1991 (the decree had been signed a month earlier), AWSA has been unable to use its office for meetings or seminars, to maintain its library, or to carry out its women's rights advocacy work in Egypt. In a memorandum defending the closure order, the Ministry of Social Affairs argued against allowing AWSA to continue its activities until the conclusion of the legal process in which the court would rule on the merits of the case. The Ministry reasoned that the continued functioning of the organization was not an urgent matter or based on substantive need.11 """"There is nothing in the application of the contested decree that could not be reversed if the decree is nullified later, particularly if we bear in mind that the dissolved society did not satisfy any urgent need,"""" the Ministry's memorandum said. This argument appears to dismiss the importance of a women's-rights advocacy group in Egypt and the Arab world, where women face state-sponsored and state-tolerated discrimination. The U.S. State Department, in its 1991 country reports, noted discrimination against women throughout the Arab world: in Egypt (""""aspects of the law and many traditional practices are discriminatory against women""""); in Saudi Arabia (""""women are subject to discrimination inherent in the Islamic legal system""""); in Sudan (""""laws continue to favor men, and women traditionally have segregated roles""""); in Jordan (""""women experience legal inequality in matters of inheritance and divorce""""); and in Morocco (""""women are not accorded equal treatment under Moroccan family and estate law""""), among other states.12 Efforts in Egypt to Reform the Law of Associations One outcome of the struggles of AWSA and other citizen's organizations with the Ministry of Social Affairs has been the emergence of a movement in Egypt to press for legal reform of Law No. 32 of 1964. The law of associations grants the Ministry of Social Affairs broad powers to monitor and control the activities of any legally registered group, as well as to license new organizations. Vague language in Article 12 of the law provides the authorities with the grounds to reject any group's application for legal status.13 The law also provides the state with the power to interfere with private citizens' organizations by placing representatives directly on a group's board of directors,14 removing association directors """"for nationalist considerations,""""15 and appointing its own replacements as directors for a period up to three years.16 Most importantly, citizens' groups are forced to carry out their activities under a perpetual cloud because of the ever-present potential for being dissolved by administrative decree. The overly broad provisions of Law. No. 32 can be used by the state to control the activities -- and the very existence -- of any private organization that strays from a strictly guided framework of permissible public discourse. A coalition of Egyptian public-interest organizations has mounted an effort to challenge Law No. 32 of 1964, branding it inconsistent with the Egyptian Constitution and international human rights standards. The group, known as the Committee to Change the Law of Associations, is composed of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, the Arab Organization for Human Rights, the Cairo branch of Amnesty International, the Legal Research and Resource Center for Human Rights, and AWSA. At present, the committee has issued a draft for a new law and is currently lobbying for support of its reform proposals, attorney Amir Salem, director of the Legal Research and Resource Center for Human Rights, told MEW. The coalition is attempting to reform a law that permits the state to dissolve any organization found to """"violate public order or morality,"""" or """"whose purpose impairs the security of the Republic or the government's republican form or its social system.""""17 Critics of Law No.32 argue that such principles allow the government great breadth to curtail freedom of association and freedom of expression. """"Violating the security of the Republic, what is the meaning of that?"""" one Egyptian lawyer asked MEW in a May telephone interview. """"You can accuse anybody of violating the national principles."""" Long-time civil rights advocate Saad el-Din Ibrahim, a professor of sociology at American University of Cairo, told MEW that the law of associations damages civil society in three ways. First, it sanctions administrative interference in the activities of non-governmental organizations. Second, it creates an elaborate bureaucracy designed to discourage free association. Last, he argued, corruption is inherent in a system where the government can impose its representatives on an association's board of directors. Professor Ibrahim described the law as """"generally restrictive"""" because it """"gives the executive tremendous powers of interference...(which can be) used selectively with any non-governmental organization."""" He noted that organizations can avoid conflict with the Social Affairs' Ministry by connecting themselves to highly placed public figures. He added that to avoid the law's onerous restrictions, many non-governmental organizations have registered as profit-making entities. Egypt's law of associations may face increased international scrutiny. """"International donors operating in Egypt have become more aware of the restrictive aspects of this law,"""" one well-placed Egyptian observer told MEW. He expressed optimism about reform should international donors put pressure on the government. Contrasting the impact of human rights organizations with that of international donors, he said: """"When it comes to aid givers, the government will listen."""" AWSA is currently preparing a memorandum to appeal the May 7 court decision before the High State Council Court (mahkama al-idariyya al-'ulia). While AWSA officials and attorneys have been optimistic about the prospects of a court reversing the administrative decree, many observers cite Law No. 32 as an obstacle to genuine freedom of association in Egypt. As Professor Ibrahim told MEW: """"This law has stood in the way of revitalizing civil society in Egypt."""" * * * In Egypt, AWSA lawyers are drafting their next appeal, and the Committee to Change the Law of Associations is lobbying for reform.

Participating in the mission were Virginia N. Sherry, associate director of MEW, and John Valery White, an attorney and Orville Schell Fellow with Human Rights Watch. On February 5, while the mission was in progress, MEW representatives were informed by the government that they would be able to visit and inspect Egyptian prisons, access MEW has sought since 1990. MEW accepted the invitation and, beginning on February 12, visited six prisons over an eight-day period. These six facilities housed 9,778 inmates, over 27 percent of Egypt's total prison population. Five of the prisons are located just outside the Cairo metropolitan area: in Abu Zabel, northeast of the city; in Tora, southeast of Cairo on the Nile; and in Qanater, northwest of Cairo on the Nile. The sixth prison is in the city of Tanta, about 55 miles northwest of Cairo. MEW chose to visit Abu Zabel and Tora prisons because political prisoners -- some in long-term detention without charge -- are held there, and because each facility contains a high-security prison (Abu Zabel Liman and Tora Liman) for prisoners sentenced to hard labor. Qanater was selected because 1,100 of Egypt's 1,441 women detainees and sentenced prisoners are held there. MEW also sought to visit a general prison, and Tanta was selected for this reason. While the prison visits were underway, Egyptian daily newspapers began to characterize MEW's observations and findings, often quoting Interior Minister Muhammed Abdel Halim Moussa, without contacting MEW representatives for comment. In order to publicly respond to misrepresentations that appeared in the Egyptian press, MEW held a press conference in Cairo on February 22, at the conclusion of the mission, to clarify the facts and release preliminary findings.

All are facing trial, some on criminal charges, some on charges of subversion. Asia Watch believes that most were in fact arrested for the non-violent expression of their support for East Timor's independence and should be released unconditionally; any who engaged in violence should be charged with an appropriate criminal offense and have all the rights guaranteed to detainees by domestic and international law. Asia Watch is concerned at reports that several students, including two of four East Timorese transferred from Bali to Jakarta in late December, were severely beaten or otherwise mistreated. For the first weeks of their detention, all the East Timorese were denied access to friends, family, and counsel; some still are being held incommunicado. One Indonesian lawyer, Ponco Atmono, has taken on 20 of the cases of those detained in Dili; he is believed to have been government-appointed. Asia Watch believes that international observation of these trials, expected to start next month in Jakarta and Dili, is critically important as an indication of continuing concern with the aftermath of the November 12 massacre, with the situation in East Timor more generally, and with the administration of justice by Indonesian officials.

It has also reviewed the Indonesian press covering the two and a half week long investigation and interviewed people in Dili at the time the investigation was taking place. Based on these sources, Asia Watch concludes that the National Commission's investigation was fatally flawed by the Commission's government ties and by the lack of experience of those involved in conducting investigations of this kind.
