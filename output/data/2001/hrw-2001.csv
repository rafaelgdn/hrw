"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/12/21/iran-journalist-risk","Iran- Journalist at Risk","Iran: Journalist at Risk","","12/21/2001","Human Rights Watch today said it was gravely concerned about the detention of Siamak Pourzand, a 73-year-old journalist who was arrested on November 29 and whose whereabouts remain unknown.  Human Right Watch believes that the Iranian government may be seeking to fabricate criminal charges against him, perhaps with the intent to silence him and deter other open critics of the government.  “We are alarmed by a growing pattern of arrests in Iran where the authorities deny the whereabouts of those detained for weeks or even months,” said Hanny Megally, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch’s Middle East and North Africa Division. “It is precisely during such periods of incommunicado detention that individuals are at greatest risk of being tortured or otherwise pressured into making confessions.”  Siamak Pourzand was last seen leaving his sister’s house at 9:00 pm on November 29. There was no news about him until December 14, when his family received a phone call from the Vice and Virtue Committee in Tehran asking for more clothing for their prisoner, Mr. Pourzand. His family’s efforts to find out where he was being held have been unsuccessful. An ominous development in his case occurred in early December when plainclothes security personal seriously beat Ms. Venus Farimehr, a colleague of Mr. Pourzand. She was reportedly forced to sign a statement confessing to an adulterous relationship with Mr. Pourzand, and incriminating him in other unspecified offences.  Siamak Pourzand heads a newly established Artistic and Cultural Complex which organized cultural gatherings for artists, writers and journalists. In recent years he has worked as a cultural commentator with several reformist newspapers. All of them have since been closed. Mr Pourzand has also been accused in the past by conservatives in Iran of being sympathetic to the “monarchist” cause, partly because of his association with the press during the reign of the Shah of Iran and also because his estranged first wife is currently working abroad as Chief of Staff for Reza Pahlavi, the son of the former Shah.  “Siamak Pourzand’s safety is at risk,” said Megally. “Unless he is charged with a valid criminal offense, the authorities should release him immediately,” said Megally.  Over the past eighteen months more than fifty-six reformist newspapers have been closed and scores of journalists and editors working for them have been imprisoned by the conservative-dominated Iranian judiciary. The reformist press has consistently been accused by conservative clerics, including the Iranian Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as being “a base of the enemy” and as “satanic,” working to overthrow the Islamic Republic. Human Rights Watch is gravely concerned that Mr. Pourzand could face fabricated charges on the basis of Ms. Farimehr’s forced confession or his alleged links to supporters of the monarchy.","Middle East/North Africa, Iran","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Human Rights Watch is pleased that agreement has been reached to expand the scope of three CCW protocols to internal as well as international conflict. This is an advance in promotion of effective international humanitarian law and we urge governments to give their consent to be bound by this new provision as soon as possible. We congratulate the conference for adopting a mandate to conduct work on the issue of the explosive remnants of war (ERW), and we express our appreciation to the International Committee of the Red Cross for its initiative on this issue. ERW constitute an acute humanitarian problem that deserves immediate action by the international community. We view the formation of a Group of Governmental Experts as a positive step in addressing all aspects of the problems associated with ERW. We look forward to working with you over the course of the next year. Numerous non-governmental organizations possess a wealth of experience in dealing with the consequences of ERW. It is crucial that the Group of Experts consider their views not as outsiders, but as partners and practitioners. Human Rights Watch's interest in ERW has grown in part out of its leadership role in the movement to ban antipersonnel mines, but also from its extensive research and field work on the impact of the use of cluster munitions, particularly in the Gulf War and in Kosovo. We were the first group, in December 1999, to call for a global moratorium on use of cluster munitions until humanitarian concerns could be adequately addressed. More recently, we called for a halt to use of cluster bombs in Afghanistan. It has been demonstrated that use of cluster munitions leads to unacceptable civilian casualties both during and after conflict. During conflict, the wide dispersal pattern and the inability to target cluster munitions accurately makes them especially dangerous when used near civilian areas. After conflict, the high initial failure rate and the large numbers typically used result in numerous explosive duds that pose the same post-conflict problem as antipersonnel mines. Because of the humanitarian imperative, the Group of Experts' work on ERW should be concluded within one year and should pave the way for immediate negotiations aimed at a new protocol to be concluded in a similar timeframe. We are pleased that the ERW mandate is broad, and allows for examination of the factors and types of munitions that could cause humanitarian problems, and for examination of international humanitarian law concerns. There are clearly many factors to consider, from the question of the reliability of weapons technologies themselves, to selection of certain weapons in warfare, to their use in areas where civilians live or work, to the adequacy of wartime records and post-war clean-up, among others. We believe that the Group of Experts should focus on problems caused by cluster bombs and other submunitions, because of the well-documented dangers. As we are seeing once again in Afghanistan, the answer to the question of which types of munitions cause the most severe humanitarian problems, is primarily mines and submunitions. These weapons are particularly pernicious because they are both hidden killers, highly volatile to human contact, generally appearing in large numbers, with indiscriminate effects. In Afghanistan, mines and submunitions have caused casualties to civilians and to coalition military personnel. Once again, it is clear that the proliferation of submunitions increases civilian dangers. We also believe that if the cluster munition problem is to be adequately addressed, the Group of Experts must consider not just technical factors, but also those related to use and targeting. Dangers to civilians during conflict are as important as dangers to civilians after conflict. It is also clear that a possible technical """"fix"""" on future submunitions of the major militaries will not effect the existing problem of remnants of war on the ground, nor will it address problems associated with the huge existing stockpiles of submunitions, which may number in the billions. Human Rights Watch takes the ERW mandate as one to address the past, the current and the future problem. Parallel to the efforts of the Group of Experts, states should, with a sense of urgency, take unilateral steps toward our common goals. In the next year, states should adopt and publicize their national """"best practices"""" and other measures to reduce the problems caused by cluster munitions and ERW. Such an approach would facilitate the work of the Group of Experts. At a minimum, governments should declare that air-delivered submunitions should not be used in or near concentrations of civilians. Another step states can take is to ban the sale and transfer of submunitions. Such an action would have immediate impact on reducing the proliferation of the weapons themselves, but also of production technologies that perpetuate the problem. Many other positive measures can be adopted at the national level. In conclusion, let me reiterate that we look forward to working with you in the coming months and years in the effort to address our common goal of alleviating the human suffering caused by cluster munitions and other explosive remnants of war. Thank you.","Global","Arms, Cluster Munitions, Landmines"

As these forces continue to confront each other in the eastern Congo, Human Rights Watch called on both sides to impose the same discipline on their combatants in any new clashes.     """"Both sides have shown that they can make their combatants respect the rules of war when they believe it is in their interest to do so,"""" said Alison Des Forges, senior advisor to the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.     In contrast to previous combat in northwestern Rwanda where thousands of civilians were slain by both government army and rebel forces, the most recent episode inside Rwanda of the ongoing central African war cost relatively few civilian lives.     The report, """"Rwanda: Observing the Rules of War?"""" documents the findings of field research into combat in the northwest of Rwanda from May to July, based on interviews with civilians, combatants, and former combatants. Evidence shows that both government and rebel forces imposed new rules restricting attacks on civilians in the internal conflict, enforcing these through disciplinary measures. In stark contrast, the new rules did not apply to fighting by the Rwandan army and its proxies in eastern Congo's Kivu region or to ALIR's forces there. ALIR forces inside Rwanda also persisted in past patterns of looting and the use of child soldiers.     Human Rights Watch researchers received reports of Rwandan troops killing people who were traveling in the company of rebel combatants but no accounts of reprisal attacks against local residents. ALIR combatants killed at least ten civilians, mostly in the course of looting, but did not target civilians in general, nor Tutsi in particular. ALIR combatants are often identified with the forces that executed the 1994 genocide that killed at least half a million Tutsi in Rwanda. Some ALIR leaders were officers in units of the former Rwandan army and in militia that participated in the genocide. But most ALIR combatants are of a later generation and were not part of the genocidal forces.     ALIR continues to recruit and sometimes abduct children for military service, including some as young as ten years old. Several dozen children in ALIR forces were killed in recent military operations and nearly three hundred were captured by the Rwandan army. ALIR leaders have said that they have banned the use of child soldiers in accord with international humanitarian law, but in this case they have not effectively enforced their orders.     """"Both sides should continue and extend more careful observance of international humanitarian law,"""" said Des Forges. """"Let's see them apply the rules about child soldiers as well as rules about not attacking civilians. And let's see them enforce the rules of war in the Congo where combatants of both sides continue to commit abuses devastating to the local population.""""","Africa, Rwanda",""

In the indictment, released December 13, the General Procuracy gave a contorted account of the events leading up to Poghosian's death, passing it off as an accident. However, in a December 7 newspaper interview Procurator General Aram Tamazian acknowledged that the corpse had injuries consistent with torture. Human Rights Watch has gathered compelling information that government security personnel had beaten Poghosian to death.  Although dozens witnessed as the bodyguards began to beat Poghosian on the terrace of the Aragast café, fear of retribution and a resulting conspiracy of silence have starved the investigation of reliable testimony.  """"Despite his public expressions of support for the investigation, the reality is that President Kocharian has failed to make witnesses feel safe in coming forward, and so have the law enforcement agencies,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division.  Shortly after midnight on September 25, eyewitnesses reported seeing a presidential bodyguard ask 43-year-old Poghosian to step with him into the restroom of the café. Minutes earlier, President Kocharian and his guest, the singer Charles Aznavour, had left the café; as they left, Poghosian had said """"Hi there, Robik!"""" to President Kocharian. Several other presidential bodyguards and plainclothes security personnel then rushed into the restroom behind Poghosian and the bodyguard, shutting the door. Ten minutes later an ambulance paramedic pronounced Poghosian dead.  The next day, President Kocharian suspended two bodyguards and the Procurator General's office launched a murder inquiry. After a two-month investigation, the General Procuracy charged presidential bodyguard Aghamal Harutiunian with involuntary manslaughter, the maximum sentence for which is three years' imprisonment. No one else has been charged.  According to the indictment, after an altercation and brawl with Harutiunian, Poghosian """"fell over on his back, and hit his head against the ceramic restroom floor, which caused him a serious cranial-brain injury, from which he died."""" In his December 13 briefing to journalists, Tamazian insisted that Harutiunian had not intended to kill. If he had, Tamazian reasoned, he would have shot Poghosian with his pistol. According to Tamazian, Harutiunian was therefore guilty only of failing to foresee the consequences of his actions, and of carelessness.  Research conducted by Human Rights Watch in Yerevan in the days immediately following Tamazian's announcement strongly indicated that Poghosian was beaten and kicked to death by a group of security personnel, who also assaulted two of Poghosian's acquaintances as they tried to help him.  """"The charge in this case does not reflect the seriousness of the crime, nor does it take into account that there was more than one perpetrator,"""" said Andersen. """"It is a nominal charge that sends a chilling message to the Armenian people that state security personnel can kill with virtual impunity.""""  Law enforcement and security agents in Armenia enjoy broad impunity for abuse, including for torture and deaths in custody. For example, torture by these agents is widespread in Armenia, but few perpetrators are held accountable, in part because victims fear coming forward. According to the U.S. Department of State, judges routinely ignore complaints of torture, even when the perpetrator can be identified. A prominent Armenian lawyer reported to Human Rights Watch last week that in his experience ninety percent of defendants in criminal cases are subjected to torture. All but a handful fail to complain, citing fear of retribution and violence against themselves, their families, or friends.","Europe/Central Asia, Armenia",""

Argentina also announced it will refuse to extradite these officers to other countries. The cases stem from abuses committed under Argentina's military government (1976-1983), during which an estimated 15,000 people were """"disappeared."""" In the past, the country's two amnesty laws have prevented such prosecutions, but the Federal Court of Buenos Aires recently ruled that the laws were unconstitutional and void. That decision has been appealed to Argentina's Supreme Court, which has the final authority to decide if such cases can go forward.  """"The government's decision is a welcome one. We hope Argentina's courts will now play the role they always should have in examining these cases,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If the Argentine Supreme Court agrees that the amnesty laws are void, then we should finally see the wall of impunity in Argentina crumble.""""  The government announced its new policy in a decree published yesterday. On December 11, Human Rights Watch officials met with Argentine President Fernando De la Rua and the ministers of justice and the interior, urging them to adopt such a policy in all cases if the government insisted on maintaining its position rejecting extraditions to other countries on grounds of territoriality.  The decree states that from now on the government will reject all such extradition requests, a policy that, in practice, has already been followed by the Argentine government without exception since the country returned to civilian rule in 1983. Human Rights Watch criticized this policy of noncooperation in its recent report on Argentina's record of prosecuting past human rights abuses.  In recent months, the government has referred to Argentine courts for further investigation charges against former naval officer Alfredo Astiz, after rejecting his extradition to Italy and France. It took a similar decision in the case of eighteen Argentines named in an extradition request from Spain. By explicitly committing to this policy in yesterday's decree, the government has acknowledged Argentina's responsibility to prosecute those accused of grave human rights violations whose extradition it rejects.  Such prosecutions will only be able to go ahead, however, if Argentina's Supreme Court upholds the lower courts' nullification of the country's amnesty laws, the main obstacle to such prosecutions. On November 9, the Federal Court of Buenos Aires ruled unanimously that Argentina's two amnesty laws were unconstitutional and without legal effect.

As many as one thousand people are believed to have been killed in just six days as Jos, capital of Plateau State, was rocked by unprecedented violence between Christians and Muslims. The government should ensure investigations into the September massacres are thorough and impartial, and bring those responsible to justice, Human Rights Watch said.  The 25-page report, entitled “Jos: City Torn Apart,” is based on eyewitness testimonies gathered during a visit to Jos in October 2001. Human Rights Watch describes how between September 7 and 13, 2001, the city of Jos became the scene of mass killing and destruction for the first time in its history. Christians and Muslims were both perpetrators and victims. In addition to the killings, thousands of houses and buildings were smashed or burnt; homes and businesses were looted; and some villages, such as Dilimi on the outskirts of Jos, were virtually razed to the ground.  Government authorities and security forces failed to take action that could have saved hundreds of lives, Human Rights Watch said.  “The Nigerian government can’t just sit back and watch this happen,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “It has a responsibility to maintain peace. There were clear signals that trouble was brewing in Jos but these signals were ignored.”  Takirambudde warned that effective government action is urgently needed if the violence in Jos, and in hot spots across the country, is not to flare up again and cause thousands of more deaths.  Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed Muslim and Christian survivors of the violence, as well as other individuals and organizations, including human rights activists, religious leaders, students and academics. The university was one of the fiercest battlegrounds during the crisis.  The report also describes the background to these events, highlighting clear warning signs of growing tension in the weeks before the violence. Several nongovernmental organizations directly approached state government, police and military authorities to warn them of the impending dangers.  “Explicit threats by both Muslim and Christian groups were not taken seriously by the government,” said Takirambudde. “Their warnings were effectively ignored.”  Opinions about who was primarily to blame for the outbreak of violence varied and were sometimes very polarized. However, all those interviewed by Human Rights Watch agreed on one conclusion: that the violence could have been foreseen but that government authorities failed to prevent it. They also deplored the absence of the police during the crisis and their failure to ensure protection and security for the population.  Most of the violence was carried out by civilians, armed with a variety of weapons ranging from knives and machetes to guns. However, there were also reports of members of the security forces carrying out human rights violations during the crisis. In particular, twenty-two detainees who attempted to escape from Jos Prison in the night of September 9-10 were shot dead by the police.  The Human Rights Watch report urges the Nigerian government to:  Ensure that the two commissions of inquiry which have been set up to investigate the crisis–one at federal level, one at state level–carry out full and independent investigations and make their findings public. Identify and prosecute those found responsible for organizing and carrying out the violence, as well as members of the security forces responsible for human rights violations. Ensure that the police are adequately trained, prepared and equipped to prevent any further outbreak of violence in the future.","Africa, Nigeria",""

These are justice and accountability; demining; participation of women; and reintegration of refugees.  Justice and Accountability Rebuilding a justice system and ending Afghanistan's culture of impunity is not just a long-term goal; it is an urgent need if security is to be re-established and civilians protected. Funding and technical assistance for secure and humane detention centers, and for the training of police, is critical; the transfer of security functions from armed warlords to national police will not be easy.  The Bonn agreement calls for the interim administration to establish, with assistance from the UN, a Judicial Commission to rebuild the country's domestic justice system. Major resources should be allocated for recruiting and retraining jurists, prosecutors, attorneys, police officers and court personnel from the Afghan diaspora and from within Afghanistan itself.  Even if the pre-1973 Afghan legal system never extended far beyond the major cities, it is worth noting that tribal justice systems operative in rural areas are unlikely to be able to address crimes, including property crimes, committed by a party that is not a member of the tribe or ethnic group in question. Land disputes will be a major issue, and resources may be needed specifically to address this issue.  The Bonn agreement also includes a provision for an independent Human Rights Commission. Annex II of the agreement also states that the UN shall have the right to investigate human rights violations. Many human rights organizations, including ours, have recommended that a Commission of Experts be established to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious abuses in Afghanistan. Such a commission could begin to collect evidence immediately without prejudging how or before what kind of court that evidence would be used. It will need operating costs covered as well as expenses, such as the cost of forensic expertise, incurred in analyzing and preserving evidence.  Human Rights Watch has also recommended a screening process, carried out by local authorities in conjunction with international monitors, to exclude from the new armed forces and civilian police force of Afghanistan anyone implicated in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  At the Brussels conference, we urge the Steering Group to designate a task force to develop a strategy on justice and accountability issues, for presentation in Tokyo.  Demining Donor support for humanitarian mine action requires a long-term, multi-year commitment. Donors should recognize the significance and impact of the indigenous programs managed by the UN Mine Action Program for Afghanistan (MAPA) and carried out by fifteen implementing partners inside the country. Donors should recognize that there is a decade-long track record for international mine action support in Afghanistan. The funding shortage of 2000, which curtailed some mine clearance activities for a period, must not be forgotten. International assistance must support all the pillars of mine action: clearing the mines, educating the population about the threat - including returning refugee populations -assisting survivors, and destroying existing stockpiles. Funding these activities should be a top priority.  Women In light of the systematic discrimination against women by the Taliban, it is vital that a new Afghanistan government establish laws guaranteeing women's rights to education, free expression, mobility, employment, and health care. We urge donors to consider the """"Brussels Action Plan"""" adopted by the UNIFEM conference of December 10-11, including the following recommendations:  - Fund a Commission of Afghan Women, to provide names of Afghan women to the interim/provisional government, to ensure women's participation in all aspects of governance; with the necessary infrastructure (computers, telephones, technical assistance, and transportation costs). - Establish immediately a UNIFEM Fund for Afghan Women to support and promote capacity-building for women leadership. Such a fund could provide small grants to Afghan women with demonstrated leadership skills, to procure infrastructure, supplies, and technical assistance. - Provide food security geared directly toward Afghan women - food assistance and general distributions. Fund monitors to ensure that programs directed at women are successful. - Immediately begin massive teacher training courses to ensure the reopening schools on March 22, 2002 (the beginning of the Afghan school year). Many women in Afghanistan were teachers in the past, and there are enormous needs for female education in the wake of the Taliban regime. Prioritize equalized education - noting that comprehensive education for boys can contribute as well to improved equality among men and women.  Refugees and the Displaced The interim administration will include a department for refugees, displacement and repatriation. Adequate funding for this new department and its civil society partners is essential. At the same time, donors should ensure adequate funding and support for UNHCR and NGO protection and assistance work in Pakistan, Iran, and other host countries for Afghan refugees, who must be allowed to remain until they are able to return voluntarily under conditions of safety and dignity.  During the process of voluntary return to their homes, displaced persons and refugees have specific protection needs that will need funding. Targeted assistance to help returnees resume farming or gain access to adequate shelter will be important this is one area where quick-impact projects would be particularly useful. At the same time that assistance is provided for these rural areas, funding priorities should also anticipate the staggered returns that are likely to occur - with refugees first returning to urban areas before conditions have improved enough to allow them to return their villages of origin.  Donors and their Afghan partners should pay particular attention to the protection needs of displaced women and children and ensure that women play a key role in the planning and implementation of return and reintegration programs. Funding for women's programs should be directly channeled where possible to Afghan women's NGOs. Funding should be provided to ensure that refugees and displaced persons are integrated into all training and demobilization programs, and that reintegration programs are crafted so that they reach disabled, internally displaced, illiterate, and rural returnees. In all of these programs, women and children should be participants in and targeted beneficiaries of such programs.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

The Court of Cassation is scheduled to hear their appeal on December 19, but can only rule on points of law and not on any substantive matters of fact or evidence.  In a 20-page backgrounder released today, Human Rights Watch documented numerous irregularities in the trial, concluding that it was unfair at all stages of the proceedings.

The state's decision to prosecute Ibrahim came a day after he announced that he planned to proceed with monitoring of the 2000 parliamentary elections, despite his initial arrest and six-week detention without charge.  Human Rights Watch said that the prosecution had presented evidence in court concerning forgery and bribery charges against Magda Ibrahim al-Bey and Muhammad Hassanein 'Amara, and said they should be afforded a retrial on those charges consistent with international fair trial norms or released.  The Court of Cassation, if it upholds the defendants' appeal, can only refer the case back to the Supreme State Security Court and order a retrial before a different panel of judges but following the same procedures.

Human Rights Watch said the Defense Department should base its rules for the proposed commissions on those governing general courts-martial under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice.  """"The President's order authorizing the military commissions is deeply flawed. It flouts basic due process protections, and provides abusive governments a virtual 'code of misconduct',"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"Using the U.S. military's rules for general courts-martial would address many of the concerns in the presidential order.""""  The rules for general courts-martial in the U.S. include numerous due process safeguards, including the requirement of public proceedings and provisions protecting the right of the accused to counsel of choice, to cross-examine witnesses, to not be forced to confess or testify against himself, to be presumed innocent until proven guilty, to have guilt established beyond reasonable doubt, and to appellate review of convictions.  The death penalty cannot be imposed except by unanimous vote. Many of these fundamental protections were not provided for in the President's November 13 order authorizing use of military commissions. The order, however, does not preclude the Defense Department from incorporating these necessary elements of a fair trial.  Human Rights Watch also called on the Department of Defense to narrow the jurisdiction of military commissions to persons engaged in armed conflict against the United States who are being tried for violations of the laws of war. The President's order permits the commissions to try a much broader range of people, including civilians living in the U.S.  """"Military commissions should be used only when absolutely necessary,"""" said Roth.

""""The government must take action against violence committed by its supporters, just as it reacts to violence by its opponents.""""  In an assault mounted early yesterday morning, several armed men wearing the uniform of Haiti's disbanded army stormed the National Palace in Port-au-Prince. Two police officers were reportedly killed in the attack, as well as several civilian bystanders and at least one of the assailants.  In the wake of the attack, government supporters committed serious acts of political violence, with, in many cases, little or no police response. In Gonaives, two members of the opposition party MOCHRENA were reportedly killed.  In Port-au-Prince, barricades of burning tires, erected by members of so-called popular organizations that support the party of President Aristide, blocked the main roads. Mobs traversed the city freely, setting fire to buildings associated with opposition parties and leaders. One such group burned down the home of opposition leader Gérard Pierre-Charles, who was not home at the time. According to press accounts, the police refused to intervene to prevent the attack on the house.  Other buildings that were set on fire included the headquarters of the main opposition coalition, known as the Democratic Convergence, as well as offices belonging to the opposition parties Conacom, KID, and ALLAH.  According to reports received by Human Rights Watch, journalists were also targeted. Several journalists reported being attacked or threatened, and four radio stations had to temporarily suspend their transmissions.  The government should ensure that its investigations into the attacks are prompt, thorough, and impartial, and should bring those responsible to justice, Human Rights Watch said. It should also take steps to remedy the problem of the politicization of the police forces, evident in their actions yesterday.  Human Rights Watch noted that the attacks occurred in a context of extreme political polarization.

Many foreign fighters are believed to have taken part in massacres of civilians, the deliberate destruction of civilian property, and other serious abuses. At the same time, foreign fighters should not be repatriated if they face a serious threat of being tortured by their government when they return home, Human Rights Watch said.  """"Foreign fighters who have committed grave crimes must be brought to justice,"""" said James Ross, Senior Legal Advisor for Human Rights Watch. """"But the U.S. and other governments must work with the new Afghan government to address the problem of the remaining fighters and their families."""" The Afghan interim government, with international assistance, should establish a method of screening captured foreign fighters to determine their status under international humanitarian law and whether they may be responsible for criminal offenses. The detaining authorities must ensure their humane treatment at all times. To assist in this, the United States and Britain should provide logistic and technical support for the detention of captured fighters.  All persons implicated in serious violations of international humanitarian law and other international crimes should be prosecuted by competent and impartial tribunals that meet international fair trial standards. This could include trials before courts established in Afghanistan, courts in third countries exercising """"universal jurisdiction,"""" or some form of an international tribunal.  The remaining fighters and their families, and families of persons missing or detained pending trial, could number in the hundreds and possibly thousands. Under international humanitarian law, prisoners of war and interned civilians who have not committed serious crimes should be released and repatriated after the cessation of hostilities. Those who wish to return home or to a third country should be allowed to do so. Some governments will not want to accept citizens who have been fighters in Afghanistan because of security concerns. International law provides that no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their right to enter their own country, though they may be subject to prosecution at home for criminal offenses.  Afghanistan can also deport foreign fighters and their families who are in Afghanistan unlawfully, unless they fear persecution that would qualify them for refugee status under international law. Family members of foreign fighters may fear persecution because of their relation to the fighter. Such claims must be taken into account irrespective of the status of their combatant relative.  Under the Convention against Torture, governments are also prohibited from sending persons to a country where such persons have substantial grounds for fearing they will be tortured. Besides withholding deportation, such concerns could be addressed through verifiable guarantees for the safety of those deported.  Among the countries where fighters returning home may face torture or other serious human rights abuse are Egypt, Uzbekistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Yemen. In October, Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul Aziz said without elaboration that supporters of Osama bin Laden were """"ill and cannot be accepted in Saudi society, even if they were part of us. Some organs of the body may become ill, but the sick organ is amputated."""" On December 12 the Chinese foreign ministry responded to reports that there were some Chinese among captured Taliban fighters: """"These Uighurs [Muslims from northwest China] are East Turkestan terrorists. If these people are proved to be Chinese citizens, the relevant side should hand them back to China to be handled according to law.""""  Afghanistan may permit some of the remaining foreigners to stay, but local hostility may make that impossible. There may also be foreign women who wish to leave, but who have been forced into marriages or other domestic arrangements that make departure difficult.  This may leave a large number of foreign fighters and their family members without a clear destination.  Human Rights Watch urged the United States, Britain and other countries involved in Afghanistan to work with the interim government and international humanitarian agencies to address humanitarian and security issues regarding these persons, and to seek long-term solutions. Human Rights Watch also reiterated its call for the United Nations Secretary-General to appoint a commission of experts to gather and analyze evidence of serious violations of international law in Afghanistan, including war crimes and crimes against humanity, with the aim of preserving evidence and making recommendations for bringing offenders to justice.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Afghanistan, United Kingdom",""

In an eighteen-page report entitled “To Protect the People: The Government-Sponsored ‘Self-Defense’ Program in Burundi,” Human Rights Watch called on the Burundian government to disband the paramilitary force, which has been responsible for many violations of international humanitarian law.  The Guardians, as well as similar patrols in urban areas, were established by the previous government as part of a “civilian self-defense” program to combat rebel forces in the eight-year-old civil war. A recently installed transitional government has so far continued the program.  “The government has a duty to protect its citizens,” said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, “but it also has an obligation to ensure that all its armed forces obey the laws of war. Calling the Guardians ‘civilians’ does not change the facts: they are recruited, trained, and armed by the authorities. They act under military orders and, like soldiers, must be held accountable for any abuses they commit.”  In many cases, authorities required unwilling participants to serve as Guardians or as members of similar patrols in the cities even though there was no legal process for conscripting them for such service. Participants receive no pay and generally do not know how long they will be required to serve. They receive no uniform or insignia. Whatever powers they exercise are not formally established or publicly known to other citizens.  Human Rights Watch has found that Burundian officials recruited many children aged fifteen and younger for service in the Guardians and in urban patrols. Supposedly recruited to defend their own neighborhoods, many of these children were ordered into full-scale military operations far from their homes. Some officers saw the children as more expendable than better-trained adult troops and sent them into combat in the front lines. Hundreds have died in military operations and from beatings suffered in the course of training.  All parties to the civil war have used children as soldiers. The government of Burundi has signed international conventions banning the use of children under the age of eighteen years in combat, and military authorities have ordered that children younger than that age not be recruited for military service.  The report underlined the danger of preaching “self-defense” in a region where ethnically-based violence has cost hundreds of thousands of lives in recent years. “Telling people that they may have to take up arms to defend themselves makes them more afraid and more open to manipulation by ruthless leaders,” said Des Forges. “If people think the government cannot or will not protect them, they will be far readier to attack others.”","Africa, Burundi",""

The INS has also said that it cannot provide information regarding a Pakistani citizen who died in its custody unless Human Rights Watch produces a document with the man's signature indicating his consent to the release of information. The man, Mohammed Butt, died on October 23 allegedly of unspecified heart problems.  """"The government is saying 'trust us,' but democracies require more than trust, even in difficult times,"""" said Allyson Collins, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"No good comes from keeping the public in the dark about how detainees are treated.""""  Human Rights Watch, the largest U.S.-based human rights organization, requested permission in October and November to visit four jails and detention centers that hold people arrested in connection with the terrorist investigation. Human Rights Watch has now received denials for three of the facilities and awaits a response to the fourth request.  The INS District Director in Newark turned down access to the Hudson County Correctional Center on November 30 saying that interviewing detainees would not be feasible given the """"extraordinary"""" circumstances. The wardens of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, and the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, NY sent identical letters on December 6 that stated that the events of September 11 required them to minimize """"activities not critical to the day-to-day operations of the institution."""" Human Rights Watch's request to visit Passaic County Jail in Paterson, NJ, is still pending.  Human Rights Watch requested permission to visit the facilities because it was concerned by reports of inappropriate treatment and infringement on detainees' rights. Since that time, interviews with former detainees and with attorneys representing detainees have reinforced those concerns.  Human Rights Watch conducts jail and prison investigations around the world to ensure that the treatment of detainees is consistent with standards affirmed in international human rights treaties and internationally recognized standards for detention. The rights group has made numerous such investigations in the United States, visiting scores of federal, state, and local facilities, including the Bureau of Prisons' Administrative Maximum Security Prison in Florence, Colorado and more than a dozen county jails holding INS detainees.  On October 29, Human Rights Watch wrote to the INS, FBI, and the Hudson County prosecutor's office to obtain information about the October 23 death in custody of Muhammed Butt, a Pakistani national. Mr. Butt had been detained as part of the investigation into the September 11 attacks. In a December 6 response, the INS refused to disclose any information regarding Muhammed Butt, """"due to laws relating to privacy.""""  In that letter from INS headquarters in Washington, DC, Human Rights Watch was instructed to contact the INS District Director in Newark if the group had further questions. The letter added, """"when you contact the District Director, please be sure to have written consent from Mr. Butt stating that that office is able to release information concerning his case to you. This statement should contain his name and your name and his alien number along with his written signature.""""  On September 19, Mr. Butt, 55, was detained and questioned by the FBI and INS in connection with the September 11 attacks. Investigators reportedly found no proof of any connection between Mr. Butt and those who carried out the September 11 attacks, but he was held on immigration charges for overstaying his visa. Different INS officials made contradictory statements about whether he was awaiting a deportation hearing before an immigration judge or simply waiting for removal. Mr. Butt was never accused of any crime.  The Human Rights Watch letter expressed concern over Mr. Butt's death and posed several questions about his treatment in an attempt to obtain information about the medical screening and assistance he received at the jail, and the conditions of detention.  """"I am perplexed by the INS's suggestion that we obtain the signature of a man who has died,"""" said Collins. """"The death of a detainee is a very serious matter and we urge the U.S. government to investigate it fully.""""  In recent testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Attorney General John Ashcroft said, """"[T]o those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: your tactics only aid terrorists."""" Human Rights Watch believes that denying basic information about detainees and refusing access to detention centers prevents independent fact-finding and the acquisition of accurate, first-hand information.

""""But this legislation is unfortunately a frontal assault on fundamental rights.""""  In a critique issued on November 16, in advance of the bill's parliamentary readings, Human Rights Watch urged parliamentarians to reject provisions that would define terrorism so broadly that individuals could be found """"guilty by association."""" Human Rights Watch was also critical of provisions that would permit prolonged indefinite detention of terrorist suspects without charge, would allow the U.K. to derogate from certain obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, and would severely undermine the right to seek asylum in the U.K.  Although the definition of a terrorist in the new law has been refined to include those who """"support or assist"""" terrorists, these terms remain vague and undefined. The status of the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) is also enhanced, but suspects' access to judicial review before a court remains restricted to questions of law. Moreover, the provision for secret proceedings before the SIAC remains intact. None of the amendments to the bill effectively responded to Human Rights Watch's concerns.  The group also expressed a broader concern that the U.K.'s derogation from certain provisions of the European Convention sends a signal to other Council of Europe member states that obligations under the convention can be disregarded with ease.  """"The passage of the Human Rights Act in 2000 was a milestone, """" said Andersen. """"But now the U.K. is departing from the European Convention and adopting a law that permits indefinite detention without trial and a denial in some cases of the right to seek asylum.""""  Human Rights Watch criticized Home Secretary David Blunkett for equating critics of the bill with supporters of terrorism. Among those critics were a number of members of the House of Lords who complained in debate that certain provisions could lead to human rights abuses, without significantly improving U.K. security. Many human rights and civil liberties organizations with large U.K.-based memberships also opposed the bill.  """"By impugning opponents to this bill, the U.K. is trying to silence anyone with a genuine concern for the effect these new measures will have on their rights,"""" said Andersen. """"Immigrant and refugee communities in particular will feel the full force of a new law that implicitly makes them suspect.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed concern for the law's impact on the right to seek asylum in the U.K. and the obligation not to return a refugee to a country where his or her life or freedom could be threatened. This week the U.K. stated at a high-level ministerial meeting on the Refugee Convention that the anti-terrorism law """"will in no way undermine the UK's obligations under the Convention. Indeed, it is not designed to do so.""""  """"In fact, the new law explicitly undermines the Refugee Convention at the expense of those the convention was designed to help,"""" said Andersen.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/12/12/argentina-support-human-rights-trials","Argentina- Support Human Rights Trials","Argentina: Support Human Rights Trials","","12/12/2001","(Buenos Aires) - The Argentine Government must support court efforts to bring justice for the massive human rights abuses committed under military rule, Human Rights Watch said in a new report released today.   While the country's courts have made notable progress in reinvigorating long-stalled prosecutions of the perpetrators of """"dirty war"""" crimes, high-level officials of the Argentine government have been reluctant to support the reopening of human rights trials.   Argentina was racked by left wing and government-backed right wing terror in the early 1970s. After the armed forces took power in a March 1976 coup, military and police kidnapped at least 14,000 suspected leftists, tortured them in secret detention centers, executed them, and disposed of their bodies in secrecy. Although two amnesty laws passed in 1986 and 1987 protected most of the perpetrators from criminal prosecution, an Argentine appellate court has just struck down these laws.   """"For years, many relatives of the victims have chafed at the impossibility of obtaining justice,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"Now that the crimes committed during those years may finally be prosecuted, the government must fulfill its responsibility to ensure justice.""""   On November 9, the Federal Court of Buenos Aires invalidated the country's longstanding amnesty laws. The court ruled unanimously that the """"full stop"""" and """"due obedience"""" laws, introduced by the elected government of Raúl Alfonsín in 1986 and 1987 to appease military anger at human rights prosecutions, were unconstitutional and violated international norms. """"To do justice is not an option, but an obligation,"""" the court affirmed.   The 45-page report, """"Reluctant Partner: The Argentine Government's Failure to Back Trials of Human Rights Violators,"""" traces the history of the ruling back to 1995, when dramatic revelations about """"death flights"""" (in which drugged political detainees were dropped from planes into the Atlantic) spurred local human rights groups to fight for justice in the courts. One such group, the Center for Legal and Social Studies, brought a case involving the """"disappearance"""" of a Chilean-Argentine couple that reached the court of Federal Judge Gabriel Cavallo.   On March 6, 2001, ruling in the couple's case, Judge Cavallo declared the amnesty laws unconstitutional and without legal effect. It was this landmark decision that the Federal Court of Buenos Aires upheld in November.   The Argentine Supreme Court is expected to hear an appeal next year against the Federal Court ruling lodged by two former police agents accused in the case. If the court rejects the appeal, the door will be open to further human rights prosecutions.   Officially, the government remains aloof from the process unfolding in the courts, but cabinet ministers have expressed disagreement with the Cavallo ruling in press interviews. Moreover, during 2001, the ministers of foreign relations and of defense have rejected extradition requests from Italy, France, Spain, and Germany for crimes committed in Argentina against citizens of those countries, asserting that only Argentina has the right to try those responsible for crimes committed on its territory.   Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena, who signed an order on November 16 rejecting a request by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón for the extradition of eighteen Argentines, has referred the cases to the attorney general for further investigation.   """"The government must now use all the legal and political resources at its disposal to prosecute these cases,"""" said Vivanco. """"It would be unacceptable for it to deny extradition requests and at the same time defend laws that prevent its own courts from doing justice.""""   The Human Rights Watch report describes how accountability for """"dirty war"""" crimes is long overdue. After the military junta fell in 1983, the Federal Court of Buenos Aires convicted five of its leaders for homicide, torture, and illegal arrest, but President Carlos Menem pardoned all of them in 1990, ostensibly as a reconciliation measure. In January 1998, the Argentine Congress repealed the amnesty laws, but because the repeal did not have retroactive effect it did not allow the reopening of cases that the courts had closed.   Due to the amnesty laws, all the officers responsible for torture and """"disappearances"""" have enjoyed immunity from prosecution since 1987. Since then, the armed forces have continued to insist that all records of the """"disappeared"""" were destroyed when the junta left power.","Americas, Argentina","International Justice"

Genocide, crimes committed with the intent to destroy a national, ethnic, or religious group, is the most serious offense under international law. """"These charges link Slobodan Milosevic with events that shocked the world,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"Based on our field investigations during the war in Bosnia, we believe that the 'ethnic cleansing' there was an effort to eliminate the Bosnian Muslim population from parts of the country. The genocide counts are important for those hundreds of thousands of victims.""""  The indictment includes one count of genocide, one count of complicity with genocide, and an additional 27 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity arising from the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina between 1992 and 1995. The charges are based on Slobodan Milosevic's """"command responsibility"""" as President of Serbia and his alleged participation in a joint criminal enterprise. The new charges cover the shelling of Sarajevo; the mass murder of thousands of Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, both UN-proclaimed """"safe areas;"""" and for the Omarska detention camp. Photographs of the Omarska inmates, who resembled Nazi concentration camp survivors, drew international attention in 1992.  Milosevic is charged with a total of approximately 10,000 killings and 250,000 deportations in Bosnia. This is the third indictment he faces before the ICTY. The earlier two indictments covered Croatia and Kosovo. The charges against him span the years of the Balkan Wars from 1991 to 1999. The judges will decide whether to join the three indictments in a single trial.  Among the fourteen individuals listed in the Bosnia indictment as co-perpetrators are Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic. Karadzic was the political leader of Bosnian Serbs throughout the war. Mladic was the general in charge of both the arm of the Yugoslav Army in Sarajevo and the entire Bosnian Serb Army. The two have been under indictment for their roles in the Bosnian war since 1995 but have yet to be arrested.  In a report to the Security Council on November 27, Carla Del Ponte, the Chief Prosecutor for the ICTY, said that Mladic has been living freely in the Yugoslav capital, Belgrade, under the protection of the Yugoslav Army.","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

It is ironic that the very same states that conceived the 1951 Refugee Convention fifty years ago are now the main culprits in whittling away this important human rights instrument,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch. The 141 state parties to the 1951 Convention will meet in Geneva on December 12-13 to adopt a declaration of their commitment to the 50-year-old Convention, the culmination of a year of global consultations on refugee protection issues organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Key industrialized states have violated core provisions of the Refugee Convention in recent years. They are: Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Union. These governments and others have returned refugees to places where their lives or freedom are under threat, sometimes in a discriminatory manner, and subjected asylum seekers to prolonged detention. For the past two decades, states have steadily eroded their obligations under the Refugee Convention. For example, the refugee definition is being restrictively applied and narrowly interpreted in many countries, particularly in Western Europe and Australia. Moreover, the events of September 11 have been used as a pretext by many countries to introduce ever more restrictive immigration and asylum laws and policies. The anti-terrorism measures taken by some states in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the United States will also seriously erode core refugee protection standards. Human Rights Watch criticized a new anti-terrorism law in the U.S. and a bill still under discussion in the United Kingdom that would allow for the indefinite detention of non-citizens suspected of terrorism, including asylum seekers and recognized refugees, without adequate appeal rights. In both countries the new measures contain an overly broad and vague definition of terrorism that includes individuals with links to a terrorist organization, no matter how tenuous or distant in time, thus risking guilt by association. Further, proposals in the U.K. exclude asylum seekers from refugee protection if they are suspected of terrorism, without any substantive investigation of their asylum application. This runs counter to UNHCR guidelines that asylum seekers should receive a full and fair examination of their asylum claim before they are excluded from refugee protection. Asylum seekers often have been falsely prosecuted for crimes in their countries of origin, especially if they belong to a persecuted political, ethnic, social or religious group. """"States should not use counter-terrorism measures as a guise to roll back well-established refugee and human rights protection standards,"""" said Reilly. """"Recent measures fall foul of the Refugee Convention and accepted human rights standards."""" Human Rights Watch used the occasion of the gathering to call on states that have not yet ratified the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol to do so, and urged countries to lift existing reservations and limitations to the Convention. Turkey, for example, despite being party to both the Convention and protocol, continues to maintain a geographical limitation to the Convention, only recognizing refugees from Europe. This policy results in Turkish border guards every year pushing back thousands of refugees to countries such as Iran and Iraq where their lives are seriously at risk, in violation of the Refugee Convention's core principle of non-refoulement. Finally, Human Rights Watch urged states to comply with their obligations under the Convention to cooperate fully with UNHCR in its duty to supervise the implementation of the Convention. States currently interpret and implement the Convention in vastly inconsistent ways that often serve their own political interests, rather than protect the interests of refugees. Human Rights Watch said that there is a need for an independent monitoring body that will review states' compliance with the Convention. Independent oversight bodies currently operate in the United Nations system to evaluate compliance with other human rights treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the U.N. Convention against Torture.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Australia, United Kingdom","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

We are impressed with the range of issues it covers and the way it handles them. Especially because it addresses Afghanistan's most pressing and persistent human rights problems, we feel it constitutes a firm foundation for building a better future for the country. In the near future the Council is likely to be making decisions regarding several arrangements called for in the Bonn agreement. We take this opportunity to present to you recommendations regarding aspects of these arrangements that have a particular impact on human rights. The UN-Mandated International Security Force for Afghanistan The Bonn agreement, in Annex I point 3, requests the Council to authorize the early deployment of UN-mandated force. We welcome this provision and call on the Council, when designing such a force, to stress the importance of including personnel with appropriate training in international humanitarian, human rights and refugee law, including child- and gender-related provisions. Personnel should also have good cultural awareness and be skilled in negotiation, communication, and civilian-military coordination. Noting that the agreement calls for an immediate security force only for Kabul and surrounding areas, we also call on the Council to take note of future security requirements, including the security needs of ongoing humanitarian operations and future UN-monitoring missions. We urge the Council to mandate the creation of a security force that is capable of expanding to other provincial capitals in Afghanistan and linking roads, so that the force could be rapidly deployed upon direction of the Secretary-General or his representative. Given urgent security needs elsewhere in Afghanistan, we also ask that the Council consider deploying military advisors or observers now to assist all local commanders and security forces throughout the country and to gather information on security. Assistance in the Training of the New Afghan Security And Armed Forces Annex I point 2 of the Bonn accord foresees the possibility of international assistance in the creation of the new Afghan security and armed forces. As the Council designs this assistance program, we urge it to insist that persons who have been implicated in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law be disarmed and prohibited from joining the new armed forces and civilian police. This is imperative to prevent a continuing culture of impunity and abuse. As a practical matter, such sidelining should occur at all levels of the military and police power structures. Screening should be carried out by local authorities in conjunction with international monitors. Similar screening has been conducted in other contexts, such as El Salvador, where the UN assisted in efforts to disqualify military personnel from service on the basis of their past records, and Bosnia and Hercegovina, where the UN vetted applicants for the civilian police. The Creation of an International Commission of Experts Annex II point 6 of the Bonn accord states that the United Nations will have the right to investigate human rights violations and recommend corrective action. We welcome this provision and urge the Security Council to establish an international commission of experts for Afghanistan to investigate crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in that country. Documenting the most serious human rights crimes should be an essential aspect of the reconstruction process in Afghanistan. Experience worldwide demonstrates that accounting for past crimes is indispensable to stability and a just and durable peace.  The United Nations has already had extensive experience creating such commissions of experts, such as the one formed during the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia (Resolution 780 (1992)). As it has done in the past, the Council could request the Secretary-General to establish an impartial commission of experts to gather and analyze information, conduct investigations, and report evidence of crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Afghanistan.  The commission would be expected, among other things, to undertake field missions and to gather and preserve evidence. After consultation, its investigative efforts could focus on certain geographical areas, certain incidents, certain types of crimes, or a combination of thematic and geographical emphases. The commission could also serve as a depository for information collected by governments, intergovernmental organizations and nongovernmental organizations (the Yugoslav Commission compiled 64,000 pages of such documents). The commission should be tasked to issue interim reports on particular investigations that have been completed as well as a final report that would recommend what further steps are warranted.  The commission should treat as a priority alleged crimes committed by senior figures in custody. Human Rights Watch knows of three senior Afghan Taliban commanders who are now in Northern Alliance custody for crimes allegedly committed against civilians in Afghanistan in 1998, 2000 and 2001. An international commission offers several distinct advantages. With a diverse staff of experts, both international and Afghan, the commission would ensure the impartiality necessary for a credible accounting. By creating an accurate record of the most serious atrocities committed in Afghanistan, the commission could help to end the climate of impunity there. The commission's findings could lead to the initiation of criminal proceedings before a competent national court or a special international tribunal, or support a truth commission -or both. Its fact-finding would help lay the groundwork for the restoration of rule of law in Afghanistan. The commission would require sufficient funding and staff to meet its objectives. The commission could be funded through assessed contributions and supplemented by a voluntary trust fund. To carry out its functions the commission's staff would require adequate security protections. Refugee Issues Human Rights Watch takes note that the Bonn agreement, in Annex IV, establishes a Department of Return of Refugees in the new transitional government of Afghanistan. We urge the Council to request that UNHCR immediately begin cooperating with this department on all refugee issues and that UNHCR work with the department to create a multilateral Refugee and Repatriation Commission, consisting of representatives of the Interim Authority, Iran, Pakistan and UNHCR, to discuss repatriation and refugee screening issues. We urge the Council to stress to UNHCR the importance of incorporating the views of independent refugee representatives and aid organizations. The Council should also urge this commission to ensure that all future refugee screening and repatriation operations are conducted on a voluntary basis, and under conditions of safety and dignity. The fluidity of conditions on the ground inside Afghanistan should be taken into account, and all individuals who remain in Pakistan, Iran, or elsewhere in the region who continue to be in need of international protection should be allowed to remain in safe countries of refuge until conditions on the ground allow for safe and voluntary returns. The Commission should represent the interests of all regional and ethnic groupings contained within the refugee population in all of its activities. In addition, the specific needs of women, children, and demobilized soldiers should be taken into account in any repatriation exercise. Reiteration of the UN's Commitment to International Justice We urge the Council to reiterate in its resolutions concerning Afghanistan the principle that there must be no amnesty from prosecution for persons who have committed crimes against humanity or serious violations of international humanitarian law, in accordance with UN policy under Secretary-General Kofi Annan, articulated, inter alia, in his report on the protection of civilians in armed conflict presented last March.  * * * We firmly believe that by immediately addressing the above issues the Council would signal the international community's commitment to ending impunity for crimes against humanity and the most serious violations of the laws of war. That commitment would contribute significantly to the building of a climate of trust and hope in the new Afghanistan. We look forward to discussing this proposal with you. We will be contacting your office shortly to arrange an appointment. Sincerely, Sidney Jones Executive Director Asia Division Joanna Weschler U.N.

More than three thousand refugees have been moved so far. Releasing testimonies taken in the New Jalozai refugee camp near Peshawar, and in Kotkai camp close to the Afghanistan border, Human Rights Watch called on the government of Pakistan and UNHCR to locate refugee camps in areas where the safety of refugees and relief staff can be guaranteed.  """"Refugees in Pakistan are faced with a no-win situation,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch. """"They can either move to the camps nearer to Afghanistan, where their security cannot be guaranteed, or they can stay in Peshawar, where their food supply and winter shelter cannot be guaranteed. This really amounts to no choice at all.""""  The involuntary relocation of refugees is contrary to an agreement reached between the government of Pakistan and UNHCR in early November to move newly arrived Afghan refugees to sites in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP, or """"tribal areas""""). Both parties agreed that the relocation of the refugees should be entirely voluntary.  On November 14, UNHCR and the government of Pakistan started relocating refugees from New Jalozai camp in Peshawar to Kotkai. The new site is located only eight kilometers from the border.  Pro-Taliban, pro-Pashtun and anti-foreigner sentiment in the NWFP is high, raising serious security concerns for expatriate relief workers and for refugees from ethnic minority groups, such as the Hazaras, Uzbeks, and Tajiks. So far, the majority of the 3,300 relocated refugees have been Pashtuns, but there are plans to move refugees from ethnic minority groups in the near future.  Although UNHCR has asserted that the refugees are relocating voluntarily, Human Rights Watch found that many refugees did not have sufficient information about the relocation and conditions in the new camp. UNHCR ran an information campaign a few weeks prior to the registration. However, during the time that refugees were signing up, there was only one information desk in the entire camp of more than 50,000 refugees. Refugees interviewed by Human Rights Watch explained that they had little information and felt that they had no option but to move.  The government of Pakistan has publicly stated that it will close New Jalozai refugee camp in Peshawar, where the refugees are currently living, due to disputes over the land. According to government policy, new Afghan refugees who arrive unofficially in Pakistan are not entitled to any assistance.  Under the November agreement between the government of Pakistan and UNHCR, however, new arrivals who are relocated to the sites in the tribal areas will be provided with assistance. Refugees who are totally dependent on relief assistance, in particular widows and other female heads of household, felt that they would be left with no shelter, food, or medical care to survive the harsh winter if they didn't move to the new camp.  Human Rights Watch also called on the government of Pakistan to increase security for international humanitarian workers working in the new camps.  """"If humanitarian staff are unable to work safely in the tribal areas it defeats the whole object of the relocation,"""" said Reilly. """"The Pakistan authorities must work harder to ensure the safety of international relief workers. In the long run, safer sites for the refugees should be found.""""  Human Rights Watch witnessed the separation of families during the confusion of the relocation and interviewed two women who left behind their sons in school in Peshawar, 130 kilometers from the new camp, in their desperation to get on the buses departing for the new site. Other refugees told Human Rights Watch that they were reluctant to move to the new camp because it would mean leaving behind family members who lived in Peshawar.  Under the agreement between UNHCR and the government of Pakistan, tribal authorities who apprehend new arrivals at the border checkpoints are now required to send them to one of the new refugee camps, rather than taking them back to the border and returning them to Afghanistan, as they had done previously. Although this is an improvement, Human Rights Watch remains concerned that refugees in the tribal areas continue to be at risk of being returned to Afghanistan, in violation of the fundamental principle of non-refoulement.  Human Rights Watch called on UNHCR to ensure that refugees are provided with sufficient information about the relocation and the location and conditions in the new camps. Human Rights Watch urged all parties to take immediate steps to prevent armed elements from entering the camps or using them for recruitment or any other military purpose.","Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Particularly in the first two areas, attention to the particular needs of women is critical. We hope the ASG can use its influence to ensure that programs in each of these areas are adequately funded.   Justice and Accountability The donor community needs urgently to develop a strategy for how to address security needs in the immediate term (logistic support for secure and humane detention centers is one painfully apparent need) and for the post-conflict period. It then needs to provide the funding to make the strategy work. Managing the transfer of security functions from armed warlords to national police is not going to be easy, but the problem needs attention now. Afghanistan's legal system urgently needs to be rebuilt. At best, its sway never extended far beyond major urban areas, but in the early 1970s, there were good criminal and civil codes, a system of district courts, and a reputable law faculty at Kabul University. Major resources are going to be needed for retraining and recruiting jurists, prosecutors, attorneys, police officers, and court personnel. The Afghan diaspora includes many professionals with these skills; work should start now on identifying them.   Tribal justice systems operative in rural areas are probably not going to be able to address issues that involve crimes, including property crimes, committed by a party that is not a member of the tribe or ethnic group in question. They may also be unable to fairly address crimes against women. Land disputes will be a huge issue as refugees and the displaced return, and as political power shifts.   Accountability for past abuses will also have to be addressed. Human Rights Watch has recommended that the Security Council authorize a Commission of Experts to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious abuses in Afghanistan. That Commission will also need funding.   Assistance will be needed to build rights protections into Afghan law. In light of the systematic discrimination against women by the Taliban, it is vital that a new government establish laws guaranteeing women's rights to education, free expression, mobility, employment, and health care.   Refugees and Displaced To ensure that the needs of returning refugees and displaced persons are adequately addressed, donors may want to assist a transition government to set up a department for refugees, displacement and repatriation to liaise with U.N. and NGO officials on all issues relating to displacement, repatriation, and reintegration. It should also encourage a transition government to establish a joint commission with representatives of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as UNHCR, to ensure the sustainable and voluntary repatriation of Afghan refugees and internally displaced persons. The commission, whose membership would include representatives from the refugee and displaced communities, would establish timetables for repatriation, draft principles and criteria for voluntary repatriation that ensure maximum protection for returnees, identify short and long-term funding needs, and draw up specific repatriation agreements between these countries that include core protection safeguards. Donors and their Afghan partners should pay particular attention to the protection needs of displaced refugee women and children and ensure that women play a key role in the planning and implementation of return and reintegration programs. Funding for programs for women should be directly channeled where possible to Afghan women's NGOs, and the programs should be crafted so that they reach rural women, widows, and women who are disabled, internally displaced, or illiterate.   Demining Expanded programs for demining and mine awareness education are already on the agenda of the World Bank, but we would like to underscore the need for resources. Before U.S. led attacks began in early October, Afghanistan was already littered with land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). In 2000, there were almost 100 mine or UXO casualties a month (which itself was a sharp decline over recent years). Since October, thousands of missiles and bombs have been launched or dropped by U.S. and British forces into Afghanistan, many of which fail to detonate and become hazardous uxo. Cluster bombs are especially dangerous because of the high """"dud rate"""" of the innocuous-looking bomblets they drop. Training to clear this new type of UXO is urgently needed. We also note that rapid clearance of roads is essential if the safe and timely delivery of humanitarian aid is to be ensured.   Thank you for your attention to these matters.

The 187-page report, Second Class: Discrimination Against Palestinian Arab Children in Israel's Schools, is based on Human Rights Watch investigations at twenty-six Arab and Jewish schools and on nationwide statistics compiled by the Israeli government. Nearly one-quarter of Israel's 1.6 million schoolchildren are Palestinian Arab citizens and are educated in schools run by the Israeli government, but operated separately from those of the Jewish majority.  """"Government-run Arab schools are a world apart from government-run Jewish schools,"""" said Zama Coursen-Neff, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"In virtually every respect, Palestinian Arab children get an education inferior to that of Jewish children, and their relatively poor performance in school reflects this.""""  Palestinian Arab children drop out of school at three times the rate of Jewish children and are less likely to pass the national matriculation exams for a high school diploma. Only a handful make it to university. Among Palestinian Arabs, the Bedouin from the Negev Desert fare the worst in every respect. """"Discrimination is cumulative, and at each level, more Palestinian Arab children are winnowed out,"""" Coursen-Neff said.  The report found striking differences in virtually every aspect of the education system. The Education Ministry does not allocate as much money per head for Palestinian Arab children as it does for Jewish children. Their classes are 20 percent larger on average. They get far fewer enrichment and remedial programs-even though they need them more-in part because the Ministry uses a different scale to assess need for Jewish children. Their school buildings are in worse condition, and many communities lack kindergartens for three and four-year-olds. Palestinian Arab schoolchildren do not have the same access to counseling and vocational programs. One of the largest gaps is in special education, where disabled Palestinian Arab children get less funding and fewer services, have limited access to special schools, and lack appropriate curricula.  Arabic is an official language and the language of instruction in Israel's Arab schools. Nevertheless, the government devotes inadequate resources toward developing Arabic curricula in general, and Palestinian Arab teachers have far fewer textbooks and teaching materials at their disposal than their Jewish counterparts. Some of the content, especially the mandatory study of Jewish religious texts, alienates students and teachers alike.  """"The government has admitted that it spends more per Jewish child, but it hasn't changed its policies,"""" said Coursen-Neff. """"The children who need the most-Palestinian Arab and, especially, Negev Bedouin-are getting the least."""" Last fall the government promised extra money for Arab education. This year it is not delivering on that promise in the 2002 budget.  Human Rights Watch called on the Israeli government to immediately end discrimination in its schools system:  The Ministry of Education should adopt a written policy of equality that explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of religion, race, ethnicity, or gender. The ministry should immediately begin distributing all funding and programs to schools on a non-discriminatory basis and allocate additional funding to close the gaps between Jewish and Arab education. The Knesset should amend the education laws to prohibit discrimination by the national government. The government should measurably improve Palestinian Arab citizens' participation in all aspects of decision-making about education policies and resources.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","Children's Rights, Education, Disability Rights, Attacks on Education"

Lack of choice and insufficient information  SFJ is 45 years old. He comes from Jalalabad in Nangarhar province. He fled Afghanistan 30 days ago because of the U.S. bombing. He is planning to move to Kotkai camp with his wife and six children.   I am going to the new camp because the weather is cold in Jalozai and we are facing many problems. These days we had to borrow money even to get to Pakistan. I have to go there [to the new camp], I have no choice, what else can I do? We don't know what they will give us there, but we hope they will give us food. We are not sure, our safety depends on the people in the new place and we don't know what they are like. We haven't seen that new place. They have told us it is safe for us there, but we are worried. Those tribal people, they don't accept the words of the government. We are afraid of them because they do not listen. At first they told us that the new place is a desert and you can't leave your women and children there alone. We also know it is 8 kilometers from the border and maybe it is unsafe for us there. The people around us don't say good things about that place.    BJ is a widow with five children. She and her children fled the bombing and fighting in Kabul thirteen days ago. She says that bombs fell near her house and many people were killed and injured. Her brother-in-law died in Kabul when a bomb hit his house, and one of his daughters was injured in the head and her hand was broken.   I am going to the new camp because my children are very hungry and they have nothing to eat. I can't work, I have no choice, I must go. They told me that if I go there I will get a tent. The place I am living now is very cold, I have to go. I have no husband to go and ask questions for me. I have to decide to go alone. We haven't seen whether it is a good place. I want a safe place, I want my children to have a safe place. I don't know if it is close or far from the border. I am not sure if the Tajiks will go there. We think we may not be safe there. We will have to escape if it is not safe.    HJ is 38 years old. He is Pashtun from Kunduz. He fled from Kunduz about eighteen days ago because the fighting was near his home. He is planning to relocate to Kotkai with his wife, son and two daughters.   I decided to go to the camp because I am a poor person, and I cannot afford my life. I have to move to the new camp. I don't have my country, my life, my land. I have to move there, I am without my land. UNHCR told me that if I go to the new camp, I will get assistance. I cannot move anywhere else and so I have no choice. I don't know if we will be safe there, I haven't gone there and no-one has told me whether it will be safe for me or not. I am safe here in Jalozai, but they don't let us stay here. They don't want us to live here. If they would let me stay, I would stay. We are just like people with closed eyes. We reach out our hands and they take our hands, wherever they pull us, we go.   JJ is a widow in her thirties.   I fled from Parwan, outside of Kabul, about one month ago. I fled because of those bombs and fighting. They did not come near my house, but you cannot afford to live in a place like that. I do not have the strength of heart to be in a place like that and to listen to those bombs. A car of one of our relatives brought us here. I have decided to go because I have nothing to eat here. But I am afraid of any violence against us in that new place. I am an old woman and I need help. During this holy month of Ramadan, I am fasting. You know the place where we must sleep each night --- even if you are a dog --- you won't even want to stay there. I have decided to go with my two daughters and my son. We have nothing here, we have to go. Also, our people have gone there and they told us before they left that you can have a very good life there. The [UNHCR] workers came and asked for the women who have no men, and we know they took one woman before. They told her she would be safe there. We are happy about the assistance, we are just like a person with our eyes closed. We follow without seeing. But if that place is not safe for us, we will escape at night and come back here.       Family separation  SJ was crouched near the loading buses in the screening center at New Jalozai when interviewed by Human Rights Watch.   I don't know where we are going. There are 7 of us in the family. Four of my children are here now - three daughters and one son. I have two more sons, they are at school right now. I want them to come with us, but I don't know if they will come in time. I do not know the place where they will take me. I only know the name but I have forgotten it. I don't want to leave without my sons. I have to take my family on my own, because I have no husband. I want my sons to come with me, but they will make me get on the bus without them. I didn't know we would go so soon, I thought there would be time for my sons to come.   SJ got on the bus without her sons about 30 minutes after the interview.   SB is from Tagab in Afghanistan. She is 26 years old. She was interviewed by Human Rights Watch after she had relocated to Kotkai camp, without her son ZB, who is 13 years old. She wanted her son to stay behind to finish his exams in the local school. However, it wasn't clear that he would be able to find his family in the new camp, located more than 5 hours from Peshawar.   SB said:   I told the UNHCR staff that my son is at school. But they said, what can we do? We only count the people who are present. I wanted them to mark us down as a family of 7, so that if my son comes later he can live with us. They told us """"we only write a list of the people who are present, we don't make a list of those who are not."""" They marked us down as a family of 6, which isn't correct.    AJ and ALJ, a married couple, showed up for the early-morning relocation with their ticket in hand. But they had seven people marked down for relocation, and only 6 people in the family turned up. They were told to come back when they had gathered all 7 of their relatives. The missing person was their son, KH who had psychological problems and was often running away from home or getting lost. ALJ had to look after him, as well as her husband, AJ, who was also suffering from confusion and psychological problems. They were waiting to be relocated with two dusty bundles of torn blankets. Their eldest daughter had a dusty plastic bag with three hard-boiled eggs in it. They had prepared the eggs for their journey. It was all the food they had.   ALJ said:   I wanted to leave today. When I came yesterday to register my family to move, they told me I had to come back with my husband to register for the relocation. I had to find him because he wanders and he is not normal in his head. I brought him here today, and they took his fingerprint because they wouldn't accept mine yesterday. If my son was here we would be able to go and we wouldn't be lost and cold and hungry in this desert. But I have this son, these three daughters and one other son. They are hungry. I am confused about what we should do. I don't know if we will ever find my son. He can't speak properly. We don't know anything about that new place. Only God knows what it is. The workers [UNHCR] just told us it is good place where we can get food. But I know nothing about it. I don't know if it is a river or a mountain. They could just take us there and dump us into that river and that would be the end. They told us the name of that place, but I cannot even remember that name right now. I am afraid to go because I have these two single daughters (in their early teens). I don't know, there may be violence against women there. I am afraid, I don't know about safety. My daughters are single and my husband is old and not right in the head. He cannot do anything for us.   Later on the UNHCR worker wrote on their ticket that the son was lost and that they should try to find him. They were told that they would have to wait two days to depart. Human Rights Watch was able to locate ALJ three days later in Kotkai camp. She had found her son and the entire family was able to relocate to Kotkai together.      Insecurity in Kotkai camp  SHK (a woman) told Human Rights Watch:   We want a toilet near each tent. Last night there were men at the toilet and the police told us to go to the other toilet. It was very far away. The police told us that this is for men, for ladies you must walk far away. We cannot walk so far away. The police told us that the U.N. has only paid for the land the camp is on, so you aren't allowed to go outside of the camp area that has been rented. The police advised us not to go outside the camp.    RKK (a man) said:   We don't know about the people in Bajaur. We don't know what kind of people they are. We didn't know how far it was from Peshawar.    RJ (a woman) said,   People are afraid that the fighting may come over the mountain and we will all be killed here.","Asia, Afghanistan, Pakistan","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

The Mexican justice system currently leaves the task of investigating and prosecuting army abuses to military authorities. Because of this arrangement, serious violations go unpunished.  """"When it comes to human rights abuses, Mexico cannot rely on the army to police itself,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is a recipe for ensuring that no one is held accountable.""""  Mexico's army has played an increasingly active role in policing the Mexican countryside in recent years, especially in regions with large indigenous populations. Last January, President Vicente Fox declared his intention to wage a """"war without quarter"""" against drug trafficking, raising concerns that aggressive policing practices by the armed forces could take insufficient account of the protection of human rights.  The report, titled, """"Military Injustice: Mexico's Failure to Punish Army Abuses,"""" gives a detailed examination of five cases in which civilians from Guerrero state reported serious violations committed by soldiers. Despite credible evidence supporting their claims, military authorities brought charges in only one of the cases-and only after local residents surrounded a military camp and refused to leave until the government promised a thorough investigation.  The report says a major flaw in the military justice system is its lack of transparency, which bars civilians from monitoring the progress of investigations. Another is its lack of accountability to civilian authorities.  Although the current military attorney general insists that his office is committed to investigating abuses, its ability to do so is greatly undermined by a widespread fear of the army that inhibits civilian victims and witnesses from providing information to military authorities. Civilians who have pressed for investigations into alleged abuses have reported suffering reprisals.  Digna Ochoa, a human rights lawyer who worked on several of the cases documented in this report, received repeated death threats after she called attention to alleged army abuses. Ochoa was found shot to death in her Mexico City office on October 19. A note left by her side warned other human rights advocates that the same would happen to them if they continued with their work.  The problem of army impunity received official recognition last week when the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) presented President Fox with a study that documented military participation in widespread acts of torture and forced disappearances in the 1970s and '80s. President Fox announced the creation of a special prosecutor's office to investigate the cases documented by the CNDH.  """"Prosecuting these past abuses is an important step toward ending army impunity, but it is not enough,"""" said Vivanco. """"The government must also tackle the flaws of the justice system that allowed these abuses to go uninvestigated and unpunished for so many years.""""","Americas, Mexico",""

Human Rights Watch urged all Afghan forces, the United States, and the international community to facilitate the exit of these civilians from combat zones in Afghanistan. """"Foreign Taliban fighters have left behind hundreds of women and children inside Afghanistan,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Civilians in Afghanistan are entitled to protection under international humanitarian law, regardless of where they are from or what their husbands and fathers may have done."""" According to local anti-Taliban administrators contacted by Human Rights Watch, some five hundred foreign women and children, locally believed to be mostly Chechens, have sought refuge in the villages of the eastern Afghanistan provinces of Paktia and Logar. A smaller group of thirty families, apparently from Arab countries, now live in their vehicles and travel nightly around the canyons of central Paktia and southern Logar provinces to avoid the increasing U.S. bombardment of suspected Taliban mountain strongholds in eastern Afghanistan. This convoy is believed to be accompanied by some foreign armed men. Under international humanitarian law, the presence of small numbers of armed men accompanying such a group does not deprive the women and children of their civilian status. Staff members of international humanitarian agencies have been rebuffed in their attempts to contact the foreign families. The humanitarian workers told Human Rights Watch that the Arab group seems to be avoiding any contacts with local tribes. One of the humanitarian workers told Human Rights Watch: """"These people are dead very soon if someone doesn't help them - it could be the cold, or hunger, or American bombs, or local bandits."""" """"These women and children had no choice but to go with their male relatives to Afghanistan,"""" said Jones. """"Now, their male relatives have been killed or are fighting at the front, and these foreign women and children have nowhere to go to seek safety."""" Many of the so-called Chechen families arrived in Paktia following the Taliban's retreat from Mazar-i Sharif and Kabul in mid-November. The Eastern Shura (council), an anti-Taliban group, established control over Gardez and Paktia province on November 14, and a few days later allowed these Chechen families who were not accompanied by armed men to take up residence in villages and towns where extra housing existed. These families face hardships due to lack of food and the impending winter. The local governing shura of Paktia province has allowed these families to stay in Gardez and neighboring villages, but cannot provide them with adequate food and protection during the winter season. In several instances, locals have expressed alarm about the presence of foreigners linked to the Taliban in their villages, citing the possibility that their presence may attract bombing. The United States-led coalition has engaged in increased bombing of eastern Afghanistan over the last week as part of its campaign to root out remaining pockets of Taliban and al Qaeda forces in the region. Pakistan has officially barred the entry of any non-Pakistani foreigners living in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch has confirmed that three young women from Yemen were arrested when they tried to cross into Pakistan at the Chaman border near Kandahar earlier this month. These women are eighteen, twenty, and twenty-two years old; the eldest is accompanied by two daughters aged three and five. All five are held in the regular women's ward at the District Jail in Quetta. These women's plight highlighted the threat facing some 1,500 foreign civilians living in the Kabuli Bazaar region of Kandahar. While the siege around the city tightens, no plan exists to allow for the evacuation of these families.","Asia, Afghanistan","Women's Rights"

The annual meeting, convened by the World Bank, is attended by forty-five countries and financial institutions making up the Consultative Group on Vietnam. Donors should also urge the Vietnamese government to release dozens of Buddhist and Catholic religious leaders, political dissidents, and ethnic minority Christians who have been arrested or detained in violation of their human rights, Human Rights Watch said.  """"Now that Vietnam's economy is opening up, this is a good time for donors to press for human rights improvements in Vietnam,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Economic reforms will be more sustainable if they are accompanied by legal reform and basic human rights protections.""""  Human Rights Watch urged both bilateral and multilateral donors not only to insist that the Vietnamese government take the essential steps required to strengthen human rights protection but to provide any technical assistance needed. Donors should help Vietnam work on reform of criminal, press, and national security laws, Jones said, not only laws dealing with commercial matters.  To address the ongoing unrest and isolation of ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands, donors should consider funding a package of development programs for independent non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the poverty-stricken provinces of Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Kontum, and Lam Dong. Donors should insist that the projects take a participatory approach to natural resource management and land tenure and include guarantees to ensure access to services by ethnic minority people.  Human Rights Watch also urged donors to closely monitor Vietnam's progress in meeting its reform commitments at the donors' mid-year meeting next year.  """"Donors should insist on guarantees that there will be no discrimination toward potential aid recipients based on their religion, ethnicity, or political views,"""" said Jones.  During the discussion of governance issues, the Consultative Group should press Vietnam to take the following steps:  Uphold its international obligations to respect the rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and association, and to cease arrests, harassment, and arbitrary detention of individuals based on their religious or political views. Respect the right of citizens to hold political opinions varying from that of the state. These rights are enshrined in Vietnam's 1992 Constitution, and the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights (ICCPR), ratified by Vietnam in 1982; Invite the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, which visited Vietnam in 1994, to visit again to assess any progress made in implementing its recommendations. The working group should be allowed unrestricted access to the Central Highlands; Unconditionally release all persons being held for the peaceful expression of their religious and political views, including dozens of political dissidents, indigenous Montagnards, Buddhists, Catholic, and Protestant Church leaders currently under house arrest or imprisoned in provincial prisons or district and commune police stations. End the practice of detaining and prosecuting persons in secret, and in particular make public the names of all persons held for political and related activities; Achieve greater transparency and accountability in the legal and penal systems and work towards the establishment of an independent and impartial judiciary. Give advance notification of trial dates and allow international observers and independent monitors access to trials and to persons in pretrial or administrative detention and in prison; Amend or repeal Vietnam's Criminal Code to bring it into conformity with international standards. Eliminate ambiguities in the Criminal Code's section on crimes against national security to ensure that these laws cannot be applied against those who have exercised their basic right to freedom of expression; Repeal the 1997 Administrative Detention Directive 31/CP, which authorizes detention without trial for up to two years for individuals deemed to have violated national security laws. The government should ensure that all detainees receive a fair trial within a reasonable time as required under international law; Ease or eliminate restrictions on the Vietnamese and foreign media, including the Internet and electronic communications, that are in violation of the ICCPR and Vietnam's Constitution; Cease the repression of ethnic minority Protestants in the northern and central highlands, including bans on religious gatherings and other meetings, pressure on Christians to renounce their faith, destruction of churches, and arbitrary police surveillance of religious leaders and persons suspected of involvement in the February 2001 demonstrations in the Central Highlands; Address the grievances of the indigenous minorities of the Central Highlands, including land confiscation, repression of religious freedom, lack of educational opportunities, pressure to join family planning programs, and restriction of freedom of assembly, association, and of movement; Cease the persecution, unlawful arrest, torture and other mistreatment of Montagnards who have voluntarily or forcibly been returned from Cambodia to Vietnam; and Remove arbitrary restrictions on access to the Central Highlands by the U.N.

Human Rights Watch said that the U.S. and Britain should establish procedures for the transfer and detention of Afghan and foreign combatants suspected of serious abuses. These fighters should be taken into custody by U.S. or British forces and delivered to an independent authority, or be placed in safe and secure detention facilities in Afghanistan, with oversight by U.S. or U.K. forces and independent observers.  """"Fazil, Dadaullah, and Nuri represent a test case for how the international community is going to ensure that those who are implicated in the worst atrocities in Afghanistan are brought to justice,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If these men and others like them are not prosecuted, the cycle of violent abuse in Afghanistan is not going to end.""""  Mullah Fazil had overall operational command, and specific sectoral responsibilities, during a Taliban offensive that led to the recapture of Khwagaghar town in Takhar province and surrounding areas in January 2001. Over thirty civilians were detained and summarily executed during this operation, while at least forty-five others were detained and transferred to a jail in Kunduz. Numerous witnesses have also testified that Fazil visited Yakaolang district, as commander-in-chief, during a January 2001 massacre of over 170 ethnic Hazara civilians. The Yakaolang victims had been detained by Taliban forces and then executed by firing squad in public view.  Mullah Dadaullah commanded Taliban forces that carried out a scorched earth policy in Yakaolang district, in the mainly Shi'a Muslim Hazarajat region, in June 2001. After briefly recapturing Yakaolang, Dadaullah's forces burned down over 4,000 homes, shops, and public buildings in the district. His forces continued their scorched earth policy as they retreated east, destroying entire towns and villages in the western part of Bamiyan province. Most of the civilian population in western Bamiyan fled the Taliban advance, but those who remained behind, as well as some who had encamped in the hills, were summarily executed. The Taliban's official Bakhtar Information Agency confirmed Dadaullah's responsibility for the military operations in the area. Dadaullah is also reportedly responsible for the massacre of Shi'a Muslims in Syedabad, in Mazar-I Sharif, in 1998.  Mawlawi Nurullah Nuri, the former governor of Balkh province - in which the city of Mazar-i Sharif is located - was military commander of the northern zone under the Taliban. He could be implicated in the reported summary executions of ethnic Uzbek civilians in Balkh in May 2001, and in a massacre of civilian prisoners that took place at Robatak Pass, on the border of Samangan and Baghlan provinces, in May 2000.  Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, to facilitate an arrangement, with the approval of Afghan representatives and the United Nations Security Council for an independent authority to take custody of these suspects, and others with similar accusations against them, until a venue for a fair trial can be determined.  The rights group suggested that because there is currently no possibility for a fair and impartial trial in Afghanistan, persons accused of committing atrocities in Afghanistan will at least at the outset probably have to be tried in other courts - either domestic courts in third countries with universal jurisdiction (laws specifically allowing trials for human rights abuses, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in other nations) or before an international tribunal specially created for Afghanistan.  Human Rights Watch noted that President Bush on November 13 issued a military order authorizing the trial by special military commissions of non-U.S. citizens he has reason to believe are members of al Qaeda, have assisted al Qaeda members, or have engaged in or aided acts of international terrorism. The organization has criticized the proposed military commissions for failing to ensure that prosecutions would meet basic fair trial requirements guaranteed under U.S. and international human rights law. Violations of international law unconnected with acts of international terrorism against the United States, such as the abuses in Afghanistan cited above, would not be covered by the military order. Human Rights Watch said prosecuting human rights violations and war crimes in Afghanistan was critical to the future of the country, and again urged the United Nations to establish a commission of experts to investigate war crimes, crimes against humanity, and other serious abuses in Afghanistan.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Afghanistan, United Kingdom",""

The need to keep these antipersonnel mines to defend South Korea is regularly cited by U.S. officials as a key reason for the U.S. not joining the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty. According to information obtained by Human Rights Watch from the U.S. Army Material Command in a Freedom of Information Act request, 45 percent of the 1.2 million long-lasting """"dumb"""" (non-self-destructing) antipersonnel mines retained for use in Korea are stored at depots in the continental U.S. Another 50 percent are in Korea, but at the onset of conflict will be handed over to South Korean troops for their use. The U.S. earmarks only the remaining 5 percent of the mines for immediate use by U.S. troops in South Korea.  """"This new information seriously calls into question the major rationale put forth by the Pentagon for not banning antipersonnel mines,"""" said Steve Goose, program director of Human Rights Watch's arms division. """"The U.S. has repeatedly said that these mines are needed to stop a massive surprise attack by North Korea. Obviously, they are not needed for that if they are sitting in warehouses in the U.S.""""  Today, December 3, 2001, is the fourth anniversary of the opening for signature of the Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits all use, production, stockpiling and trade of antipersonnel mines. The treaty has been signed by 142 nations, including every other member of NATO except Turkey, which announced earlier this year it would join in the near future.  """"The Bush administration needs to be fully informed about the mines retained for use in Korea,"""" said Mr. Goose. """"Most people assume that the mines for use in Korea are already there, not weeks or months away.""""  There are already more than one million mines buried in the ground in and near the Demilitarized Zone separating North and South Korea. These mines are under South Korean control, not U.S. The 1.2 million stockpiled U.S. M16 and M14 antipersonnel mines are additional mines intended for use in case of renewed conflict.  A U.S. law in place since 1992 prohibits exports or transfers of antipersonnel mines to any country. It is therefore not clear what legal mechanisms would allow the transfer of the approximately 600,000 mines held as War Reserve Stocks for Allies (WRSA) to the South Koreans. The Clinton administration announced in January 1997 that as a matter of policy the U.S. would observe a permanent ban on the export and transfer of antipersonnel mines.  Human Rights Watch recently reported that the Pentagon has recommended that the Bush administration abandon the U.S. commitment to ban antipersonnel mines as soon as possible and in particular the target date for joining the Mine Ban Treaty in 2006. The Bush administration is in the midst of a review of U.S. landmine policy.","Asia, United States, South Korea","Arms, Landmines"

Most of those detained are from the Middle East and South Asia, including 208 from Pakistan.   On November 27, U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft announced that, as a result of the government's investigation of the September 11 attacks, 603 people remain in custody. A total of 93 named persons were charged with federal criminal offenses, of whom 55 are in custody. Most of the criminal charges are reportedly minor and not directly linked to terrorism. A total of 548 persons are being detained on alleged immigration violations uncovered during the investigations; only their nationalities were provided, not their names.  The Attorney General's announcement fell short of the Freedom of Information Act request by Human Rights Watch and other groups, asking the U.S. government to release the names, places of detention and basis for detention of the detainees held in connection with the September 11 investigations. The government has to date refused Human Rights Watch access to detention centers to monitor the conditions of confinement of persons detained in connection with the September 11 investigations.  On October 29, Human Rights Watch wrote to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to express its serious concern over the death of Muhammed Butt, a Pakistani citizen, who was detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and held at the Hudson County Correctional Center. In the letter, the rights group urged the FBI and the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office to thoroughly investigate the circumstances of his death. Human Rights Watch has been unable to determine whether an inquiry was undertaken. Human Rights Watch also criticized new U.S. anti-terrorism measures that authorize military trials of those accused of terrorism, permit prolonged administrative detention without charges, enable the government to monitor communications between federal detainees and their attorneys.  """"Washington seems ready to sacrifice basic human rights in its campaign against terrorism in the U.S.,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Even in the current crisis, the U.S. government has an obligation to protect the rights to freedom from arbitrary detention and to a fair trial, rights possessed by citizens and non-citizens alike.""""  On November 13, President Bush issued a Military Order authorizing the trial of non-citizens by special military commissions when he has reason to believe such persons may be members of al Qaeda or have engaged in or aided acts of international terrorism. The order fails to ensure such trials would comport with basic obligations of justice, fundamental fairness and due process guaranteed under U.S. law and by international human rights treaties. """"Under this Military Order, a defendant could be sentenced to death without a public trial, the presumption of innocence, a right to appeal, or even proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt,"""" said Jones.  The U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, signed by President Bush on October 26, gives broad, unprecedented powers to the U.S. Attorney General to certify and then detain non-citizens suspected of terrorist activities or of threatening national security. The law contains vague definitions of """"terrorism"""" and other key terms, and fails to provide meaningful judicial review for detainees wishing to challenge their certifications and subsequent detention. The new law also includes provisions that may lead to the indefinite detention of non-citizens. New rules promulgated by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) extend the period of time non-citizens can be held for questioning, with the possibility of prolonged or indefinite detention in """"emergency"""" circumstances. Another new rule permits the INS to keep non-citizens detained even after immigration judges have ordered their release for lack of evidence. A new rule issued by the federal Bureau of Prisons permits the government to monitor communications between certain federal detainees and their attorneys when the government believes those communications may further acts of terrorism. Since the September 11 attacks, governmental and nongovernmental monitoring groups have received several hundred complaints of bias attacks and hate crimes against people of Middle Eastern, Arab, and South Asian descent, including Pakistanis. The attacks range from murder and violent assaults to the vandalizing and burning of mosques, Sikh and Hindu temples, stores, and homes. Human Rights Watch has urged the U.S and state governments to adopt measures to address such hate crimes. It has called on U.S. law enforcement officials to provide enhanced protection for targeted individuals and groups and their homes, places of business, and houses of worship; to ensure that any reports of criminal behavior are properly investigated; and to hold accountable those found responsible.

Human Rights Watch also urged the U.S. and British governments to provide logistic support to ensure such treatment so that there will be no recurrence of the kind of killings that took place at Qala-i-Jhangi fort last week. """"None of the forces fighting the Taliban have the capacity to keep large numbers of detainees in safe custody,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The slaughter in Mazar-i Sharif risks being repeated unless the U.S. and British governments take preventive action."""" At a minimum, Human Rights Watch said, the U.S. and Britain should help set up procedures for the safe surrender, disarming, and detention of captured fighters. The U.S. and Britain should also make clear that no further military assistance will be given to any Afghan commander whose forces commit serious abuses against captured fighters or who takes no action against those responsible. Finally, there is an urgent need to establish credible judicial procedures to try those in custody who stand accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or other serious violations of international humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch said it supports calls for an inquiry into the deaths at the Qali-i-Jhangi fort. Although the evidence available to date suggests that the prisoners did indeed take up arms against their captors – that the revolt was genuine and unexpected, not a pretext for slaughter – enough troubling questions remain about the suppression of the revolt to warrant a thorough and independent investigation, said Jones. Human Rights Watch stressed that this investigation must be independent, ideally led by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, staffed with experienced field investigators, and speedily deployed. The investigation should at a minimum establish: whether adequate steps had been taken at the outset to deter a revolt and to prevent access to weapons used for the revolt the circumstances under which Taliban prisoners who had had their hands bound were killed; the treatment of any Taliban fighters who tried to surrender, became incapacitated, or otherwise became hors de combat after the fighting began; the steps taken by the Northern Alliance and by U.S. bombers that came to its assistance to targeting prisoners who were taking no part in the uprising or who were incapacitated, including the prisoners who were bound; the circumstances that caused there to be almost no survivors; whether any orders were given by Northern Alliance commanders that there should be no survivors; whether the Northern Alliance or the U.S. military committed any other violations of the laws of war in responding to the prison uprising.In addition, Human Rights Watch urged the U.S. and the U.K. governments to carry out their own investigation of the events at the fort. U.S. military advisers played a prominent and visible role in advising the Northern Alliance during its military response to the prison uprising, and, as noted, U.S. warplanes bombed the fort during the uprising. The humane treatment of all persons not actively taking part in hostilities, including detained or surrendered enemy soldiers, is a fundamental principle of international humanitarian law (the laws of war). It must be respected in all circumstances, whether the conflict is considered an international or internal armed conflict, and applied for the benefit of all persons held by an armed force, be they prisoners of war, combatants without prisoner-of-war status, or detained civilians. Prohibitions include summary executions, torture, humiliating and degrading treatment, and the use of detainees as human shields. The requirement of humane treatment also includes a positive obligation to protect against dangers posed by other detainees.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Afghanistan, United Kingdom","United Nations"

The 50-page report documents how the Palestinian Authority executive branch - including President Yasser Arafat, his ministers, police, and various security forces - has seriously undermined the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law.  The report estimates that as of September 2001, the Palestinian Authority (PA) was holding about 450 people in detention without charge or trial. Most were suspected of being informants for Israeli security forces; others were alleged to have sold Palestinian land to Israelis. The PA has done virtually nothing to identify the perpetrators of about thirty vigilante-style executions, the report says.  """"The Palestinian Authority wants to be treated as an equal with other governments,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"President Arafat must ensure that the PA has a functioning judicial system which operates to protect the human rights of all Palestinians."""" Roth urged Arafat to ratify several laws passed by the Palestinian Legislative Council that would help to protect the rights of detainees.  The Human Rights Watch report, """"Justice Undermined: Balancing Security and Human Rights in the Palestinian Justice System,"""" charges the PA with failing to bring to justice militants who have attacked Israeli civilians. The report also says that Israeli responses to the current """"intifada,"""" including severe restrictions on freedom of movement and the destruction of Palestinian law-enforcement infrastructure, have aggravated the deterioration of the Palestinian justice system.  The report says at least ten separate Palestinian security and police forces are operating in PA territory, all of them operating above the law. They have systematically ignored orders from the High Court to release detainees who are being held arbitrarily. Detainees are commonly arrested without a warrant and are not told the reason for their arrest nor allowed access to a lawyer during interrogation. Once arrested, they can spend months in detention without charge or trial. The practice of incommunicado detention exacerbates the routine use of torture. Detainees are frequently subjected to """"shabah"""" (prolonged sitting or standing in painful positions); """"falaqa"""" (beating on the soles of the feet); punching; kicking; and suspension from the wrists. Five Palestinians are known to have died in police or security force custody since the current intifada began.  The State Security Court, established by presidential decree in 1995, has displaced and undermined ordinary courts. The president convenes the court on a case-by-case basis. Most trials last only a few hours, and most defendants are convicted solely or principally on the basis of confessions they made while in incommunicado detention. The accused are usually defended by court-appointed counsel who are not practicing lawyers, but serving members of the security forces. Defense lawyers sometimes have as little as a few minutes to prepare their defense.  Since the current intifada began, sixteen defendants have been tried in the Higher State Security Court or the Military Court. Fifteen have been convicted, of whom eleven have been sentenced to death. Two executions have been carried out.  The report describes a """"revolving door policy"""" of arresting alleged members of militant groups such as Hamas or Islamic Jihad, often under pressure from Israel or the international community, holding them without charge or trial, and then releasing them.  On October 31, the PA issued six-month-long administrative detention orders against seven alleged members of Hamas and Islamic Jihad.  """"Issuing administrative detention orders can only further weaken the Palestinian justice system,"""" said Roth. """"Instead of charging and bringing suspects to court, the PA now seems determined to by-pass such procedures and hold suspects in detention without trial.""""

On November 28, Czech police detained Solih at passport control, on an Interpol extradition request placed by Uzbek authorities. He is currently in preliminary custody. Tomorrow the Prague City Court will hold a hearing to determine whether to go forward with extradition proceedings.  In November 2000, the Supreme Court of Uzbekistan sentenced Solih in absentia to a 15-year prison term on charges of terrorism and anti-state activities. Human Rights Watch monitored the trial, and found it reminiscent in all respects of Soviet-era show trials. No material evidence of Solih's guilt was presented. Nine of Solih's co-defendants also received lengthy terms in prison, and two other men, sentenced in absentia in the same trial, were sentenced to death. Uzbekistan continues to execute condemned prisoners. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances.

Agreements reached in Bonn must avoid compromising the need to exclude from any future Afghan government those responsible for the most serious abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law.   We urge that the following recommendations on accountability, human rights, and refugee protection be incorporated in any efforts to build a future government in Afghanistan. If these guarantees are not put into place now, the risk will remain high that, whatever accord is reached, Afghans will continue to face brutality and destruction.   1. Accountability  The establishment of short and long-term mechanisms to address accountability for serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan can help prevent return to the unrest that has existed for more than twenty years.   So far, the only accountability mechanisms proposed are the U.S. military commissions, recently authorized by President Bush, that lack the most fundamental due process guarantees and are not designed to address atrocities committed in Afghanistan. While participants at the Bonn meeting may be willing to address methods of prosecuting their foes, it is essential that accountability for abuses committed by their allies also be addressed.   Commission of Experts As an initial step toward accountability, we urge the Secretary General to appoint a commission of experts to gather and analyze evidence of serious violations of international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan. The commission's findings could lay the foundation for criminal proceedings before an impartial tribunal, whether national or international, as well as supporting some form of a truth commission. While the choice of tribunal is debated, basic evidence could at the very least be preserved. The presence of commission investigators throughout Afghanistan would also help deter further grave abuses. Security Council action is needed because there is likely to be little agreement among the various factions in Afghanistan about whose crimes the commission should examine.   Possible Justice Mechanisms A significant obstacle to prosecution of anyone charged with violations of human rights or international humanitarian law is the absence of a competent justice mechanism in Afghanistan. Prolonged detention without trial would itself violate fundamental guarantees of due process. Three possible justice mechanisms are outlined below.   Domestic courts of law.  One option would be the reestablishment of a domestic legal system within Afghanistan, necessary in any event as part of the reconstruction process. That presupposes, however, agreement on a transitional administration under whose mandate Afghan courts would be reconstituted. Even with extensive retraining of Afghan jurists and technical assistance from international donors, reconstituting domestic courts would be a long-term proposition.    International war crimes tribunal for Afghanistan.  An ad hoc international tribunal to try serious violations of international law committed in Afghanistan would have the advantage of more readily drawing upon the expertise of justices, lawyers, and legal staff trained in the application of international law. One major hurdle would be to secure a venue that was both neutral and accessible. Another would be to secure political support among various parties inside Afghanistan who might be resistant to foreign involvement in Afghan affairs.    Trial in a third country.  The principle of universal jurisdiction holds that every state has an obligation to bring to justice the perpetrators of crimes such as genocide, crimes against humanity, torture, and war crimes - no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims. If the first two options prove untenable in the short term, trial in third countries might be an interim solution.    Questions also remain about where captured or surrendered Taliban would be held and under what conditions. Senior U.S. Defense Department officials have said that foreign Taliban fighters in Kunduz must not be allowed safe passage to a third country. Under the circumstances, the U.S. government should ensure that the Northern Alliance takes all necessary measures to provide humane detention.   Despite the obstacles to justice, the issue of future prosecutions must be resolved quickly. Otherwise, there could be thousands of prisoners detained with no resolution of their cases in sight. The existence of workable justice options would also undermine the incentive for summary justice. In the immediate term, the following measures can also go far toward ensuring accountability for abuses.   No Amnesties from Prosecution There should be no amnesty from prosecution for persons who have committed serious violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity. Amnesty arrangements often seem expedient in peace-building. But more often, they undermine progress, by giving victims the sense that their grievances do not matter, and leaders the sense that they can get away with further atrocities. In Sierra Leone, for instance, a broad amnesty as part of the 1999 peace agreement contributed to the collapse of peace a year later. That should not be allowed to happen in Afghanistan, despite reported negotiations between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban about the possibility of amnesty for Afghan Taliban leaders in Kunduz who had been responsible for atrocities.   Excluding Perpetrators of International Crimes from a Future Government Persons responsible for the most serious abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law must also not be included in a new government. Discussions on how to achieve this goal should begin now, at the earliest stages of planning for a post-Taliban Afghanistan. Although many potential Afghan leaders may not have clean hands, at the very least, those implicated in crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other grave abuses should be barred from holding office. Experience shows that past abusers who return to power often become repeat abusers. The inclusion of such leaders could also undermine efforts to create a government with broad support among Afghanistan's ethnic communities.   We note in this regard the declaration of the """"Six Plus Two"""" countries on November 12 to the effect that a future government should be a """"broad based, multi-ethnic, politically balanced, freely chosen Afghan administration representative of aspirations and at peace with its neighbors. This administration must be able to meet the needs of the Afghan people and respect human rights, regional stability and Afghanistan's international obligations.""""   Screening out human rights violators from Afghan military and police forces.  Every effort should be made to disarm persons who have been implicated in serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to exclude them from Afghanistan's new armed forces and civilian police. Screening could be carried out by local authorities in conjunction with international monitors. Such screening has been implemented in other contexts, for example in El Salvador, where the U.N. assisted efforts to disqualify military personnel from service on the basis of their past records, and in Bosnia and Hercegovina, where the U.N. conducted vetting of applicants for the civilian police.    2. Women's Rights and Women's Participation  It is vital that a new government establish laws guaranteeing women's rights to education, free expression, mobility, employment, and health care, while ending discriminatory punishment of women. Women who are currently in detention for violating discriminatory laws and edicts should be immediately released. The international community should also proactively seek out Afghan women to ensure that they are receiving the relief and aid they need, especially for education and health care. Just as important, it should ensure that Afghan women are included in negotiations on the formation of a new government. There are many Afghan women leaders who have struggled for years against brutality in Afghanistan. Indeed, they have played a major role in keeping Afghanistan on the international agenda in recent years. A process that rejects their input from the outset will fail to meet their needs in the future - and it will lose any claim to being truly """"broad-based.""""   Women must also be involved in post-conflict reconstruction as decision-makers. As the relief and reconstruction effort is being planned, women have critical information about how to ensure that such relief actually reaches the women of Afghanistan, particularly rural, widowed, illiterate, disabled, internally displaced, and returning refugee women. Women leaders at the local level also have a critical role to play in ensuring women's participation in development programs: their involvement facilitates dissemination of information through networks of women and women's rights NGOs.   3. Obtaining Basic Human Rights Commitments  Negotiators involved in efforts to establish a broad-based government for Afghanistan should seek commitments to uphold Afghanistan's obligations as a party to international human rights treaties, as well as fundamental principles of human rights and international humanitarian law. These should include guarantees of non-discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, particularly ethnic Hazaras and other Shia Muslims, as well as groups that may form minorities within specific regions, such as ethnic Pashtuns in northern Afghanistan. Attention should also be paid to developing transitional justice mechanisms that could adjudicate competing claims over land and property, while providing accountability for any continuing abuses committed by government officials and security forces. International assistance in the post-armed conflict period should include financial and other support, such as training, for institutions involved in the administration of justice at all levels.   4. Return and Reintegration of Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons   The return and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced people is a critical element in building long-term peace and security in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch urges all delegates at Bonn, as well as United Nations agencies, to formulate a working group on refugees, internal displacement, and repatriation.   The following measures should be considered by this working group:   Creation of a government department for refugees, displacement and repatriation: The working group should consider proposing the creation of a department in the future government of Afghanistan to liaise with U.N. and NGO officials on all issues relating to displacement and repatriation and to facilitate the voluntary return and reintegration of refugees and internally displaced persons.   Repatriation agreements: The working group should consider proposing a joint commission with representatives of Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as well as UNHCR, to establish timetables for repatriation, to draft principles and criteria for voluntary repatriation that ensure maximum protection for returnees, to identify short and long-term funding needs, and to draw up specific repatriation agreements between these countries.   Protection of displaced women and children: The working group should pay particular attention to the protection needs of displaced refugee women and children. These include protection against physical, sexual, and domestic violence and abuse; full and unimpeded access to appropriate assistance, including access to food, shelter, water, health care, and education for children; and full participation in decision-making and the planning and implementation of protection and assistance programs.","Asia, Afghanistan","Refugees and Migrants, United Nations, Internally Displaced People, Religious Freedom, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/27/fact-sheet-past-us-criticism-military-tribunals","Fact Sheet- Past US Criticism of Military Tribunals","Fact Sheet: Past U.S. Criticism of Military Tribunals","","11/27/2001","(Washington, DC) - Under President Bush's November 13th Military Order on military commissions, any foreign national designated by the President as a suspected terrorist or as aiding terrorists could potentially be detained, tried, convicted and even executed without a public trial, without adequate access to counsel, without the presumption of innocence or even proof of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and without the right to appeal. The U.S. State Department has repeatedly criticized the use of military tribunals to try civilians and other similar limitations on due process around the world. Indeed, its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices evaluate each country on the extent to which it guarantees the right to a """"fair public trial"""" - which it defines to include many of the due process rights omitted by the President's Military Order. The Order may make future U.S. efforts to promote such standards appear hypocritical. Indeed, even if its most egregious failings are corrected in subsequent regulations, the text of the Order may become a model for governments seeking a legal cloak for political repression.   Several countries about which the State Department has expressed concern include:   Burma   The State Department described the Burmese court system, in its most recent Country Reports as """"seriously flawed, particularly in the handling of political cases,"""" where trials are not open to the public and military authorities dictate the verdicts. SLORC Order 7/90 allows commanders to try Buddhist clergy members before military courts for """"activities inconsistent with and detrimental to Buddhism."""" The Burmese government justifies all such trials by citing threats to national unity and security.   China   The State Department has documented numerous means by which Chinese officials undermine due process. The United States has criticized China's system in part because defendants do not enjoy a presumption of innocence or its corollary rights, such as habeas corpus, standard of guilt, or the burden of proof necessary to ensure it. Trials involving national security, espionage or state secrets are conducted in secret. The government has broad authority to define crimes that endanger """"state security"""" or involve state secrets. Police can monitor client-counsel meetings and defendants are not always allowed to confront their accusers. The most recent Country Reports state that, """"the lack of due process is particularly egregious in death penalty cases."""" The lack of procedural safeguards has enabled China to engage in crackdowns on dissent that the United States has condemned, including a crackdown in predominantly Muslim areas that has """"failed to distinguish between those involved with illegal religious activities and those involved in ethnic separatism or terrorist activities,"""" as the State Department's annual report on religious freedom concluded in 2000.   Colombia   Colombia's use of faceless prosecutors, judges, witnesses and attorneys in cases of narcotics trafficking, terrorism, kidnapping, subversion and extortion during the early and mid-1990s has been criticized in the Country Reports. The 1996 Report noted that, """"it was still difficult for defense attorneys to impeach or cross-examine anonymous witnesses, and often they did not have unimpeded access to the State's evidence.""""   Egypt   The most recent Country Reports criticized the manner in which military tribunals were used to try a wide range of offenses in Egypt, from non-violent dissent to acts of terrorism. The judges in these trials are military officers appointed by the Ministry of Defense. Verdicts may not be appealed, and are subject to review only by a panel of other military judges and then confirmed by the President. In 2000, two members of the """"Islamic Gihad group in Egypt"""" who had been sentenced by military courts to death in absentia were executed. Civilians are often referred to military courts, some accused of membership in organizations that do not advocate or practice violence, but which are illegal. The 2000 Country Report stated that """"this use of military courts . . . has deprived hundreds of civilian defendants of their constitutional right to be tried by a civilian judge."""" It added that """"military courts do not ensure civilian defendants due process before an independent tribunal"""" and that the military officers who serve as judges in these courts """"are neither as independent nor as qualified as civilian judges in applying the civilian Penal Code.""""   Kyrgyzstan   The State Department has noted that in Kyrgyzstan, """"the government frequently used the judicial process to eliminate key political opposition figures."""" Opposition leaders have been tried in closed military courts - although a civilian may be tried in military courts only if a codefendant is a member of the military. The decision of civilian courts to render an indeterminate verdict back to the Procurator for further investigation may not be appealed. The Country Report also stated that, """"in practice, there was considerable evidence of executive branch interference in verdicts involving prominent political opposition figures.""""   Malaysia   Malaysia's 1975 Essential (Security Cases) Regulations restrict due process by allowing the accused to be held for unspecified periods of time before being charged and by lowering the standards used for accepting self- incriminating statements as evidence. These regulations usually apply only to firearms cases but may be applied to other criminal cases if the government decides that national security considerations are involved. The most recent Country Reports adds that """"even when the Essential Regulations are not invoked, defense lawyers lack legal protections against interference."""" Many lawyers are charged with contempt of court after filing motions on behalf of their clients, particularly if they bring about allegations of prosecutorial misconduct.   Nigeria   The State Department condemned Nigeria following the conviction and execution of author and minority rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists before a specially constituted tribunal in which a military officer was one of three judges. The US ambassador was recalled for consultations and sanctions on the Nigerian regime were extended. Special tribunals in Nigeria, including military tribunals, became commonplace during the periods of military rule from 1966 to 1979 and 1983 to 1999, and had jurisdiction over offenses such as civil disturbances, armed robbery, some categories of corruption, coup-plotting, and illegal sale of petroleum. Many military decrees also included """"ouster clauses"""" providing that government decisions could not be questioned in a court of law. In the Country Reports for 1996, the State Department noted that, in Nigeria, """"in practice tribunal proceedings often deny defendants due process."""" In a statement before the House International Relations Committee in 1998, Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Susan Rice stated that, """"military tribunals denied due process to political and other prisoners"""" in Nigeria.   Peru   Peru's use of military tribunals to try civilians accused of treason and terrorism has been repeatedly criticized by the State Department. The most recent Country Reports noted that """"proceedings in these military courts - and those for terrorism in civilian courts - do not meet internationally accepted standards of openness, fairness, and due process."""" Treason trials may be held in secret if the courts deem it necessary, and defense attorneys are prohibited from accessing the State's evidence files or questioning military or police witnesses.   U.S. citizen Lori Berenson was tried and convicted of the terrorism-related crime of treason before a military tribunal. The State Department noted that her trial lacked sufficient guarantees of due process, and State Department Spokesman Phillip Reeker in a June 2001 briefing stated that her military trial had """"egregious flaws."""" In 1996, Spokesman Glyn Davies said the United States """"deeply regret[ed] that Ms. Berenson was not tried in an open civilian court with full rights of legal defense, in accordance with international juridical norms"""" and called for the case to be retried in an """"open judicial proceeding in a civilian court"""" -- a point repeatedly reinforced by State and White House officials to their counterparts in Peru.   Russia   The arrests and detentions of various government critics, including academics, human rights activists and journalists have been documented in the State Department's Country Reports. Espionage cases in particular have been subject to frequent abuses. In 1999, Igor Sutyagin, a researcher for the USA Canada Institute was detained on espionage charges. The Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) has claimed that Mr. Sutyagin violated a secret Ministry of Defense decree on secrecy. Evidence in his case was secret, and Mr. Sutyagin remains in detention. Other individuals who have been charged with treason include Aleksandr Nikitin, a retired Russian Navy captain and environmentalist. According the most recent Country Reports, """"Nikitin's case was characterized by serious violations of due process."""" The Country Report also expressed concern about the trials of several non-Russians charged with espionage. As in the previous cases, the attorneys had trouble obtaining the details of the charges.   U.S. citizen Edmond Pope, a businessman, was arrested by FSB agents in April 2000, convicted of espionage and sentenced to 20 years in prison for his efforts to purchase Russian technology that reportedly was publicly available, and not classified, as was claimed. His trial took place behind closed doors - a fact protested by the United States.   Sudan   The United States has consistently condemned the government of Sudan for denying defendants the right to a fair public trial. As the 2000 Country Report on Sudan noted: """"Military trials, which sometimes are secret and brief, do not provide procedural safeguards, sometimes have taken place with no advocate or counsel permitted, and do not provide an effective appeal from a death sentence."""" The State Department has also expressed concern about special three-person security courts in Sudan, on which both military and civilian judges sit, and which deal with violations of constitutional decrees, emergency regulations, some sections of the Penal Code, as well as drug and currency offenses. These courts severely restrict the right of attorneys to effectively defend their clients, although they do permit defendants to appeal their sentences.   Turkey   The State Department has expressed concerns about Turkey's State Security Courts (SSC), which have been used to prosecute leaders of armed political Islamic movement, those associated with armed Kurdish movements, as well as non-violent critics of military or government policies. SSC's try defendants accused of terrorism, drug smuggling, membership in illegal organizations, and advocating or disseminating ideas prohibited by law, including those """"damaging the indivisible unity of the State."""" SSC's may hold closed hearings, and also allow testimony obtained during police interrogation in the absence of counsel to be admitted. The verdicts delivered by the SSC may be appealed to only a special department of the Court of Cassation that handles crimes against state security. Military courts may try civilians accused of """"impugning the honor of the armed forces"""" or """"undermining compliance with the draft.""""   Other countries have recently proposed legislation that limit due process. The """"Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill"""" introduced by the Home Office in Great Britain on November 13 allows foreigners to be jailed without a hearing if police or security officials identify them as potential terrorists. If foreign nationals suspected of terrorism-related activities cannot be removed to their own or a third country due to either administrative problems or provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights that prohibit the removal of those who may be subject to torture, they may be indefinitely detained. On November 19, David Blunkett, Britain's Home Secretary, defended this law by arguing that it was not as severe as the Military Order recently signed by President Bush.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Colombia, Peru, Nigeria, Sudan, Myanmar (Burma), China and Tibet, Malaysia, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Türkiye, Egypt, US Foreign Policy","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, Detention without Trial"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/26/afghanistan-urgent-need-decide-how-prosecute-captured-fighters","Afghanistan- Urgent Need to Decide How to Prosecute Captured Fighters","Afghanistan: Urgent Need to Decide How to Prosecute Captured Fighters","","11/26/2001","(New York) -- Human Rights Watch today called on the United States and their Northern Alliance allies to guarantee the humane treatment of surrendered or captured forces from the Afghan town of Kunduz, and to institute fair screening procedures to determine who should face prosecution later for serious violations of international law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Among the Taliban fighters in Kunduz are two Afghan commanders – Mullah Dadaullah and Mullah Fazil – who are implicated in some of the worst human rights abuses in recent Afghan history.  “The need to set up a justice mechanism to prosecute war crimes and crimes against humanity is no longer a theoretical issue, it’s an urgent priority,” said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. She noted that the most immediate need is to ensure that prisoners are treated humanely, but that it is also critical to establish procedures for separating people suspected of grave crimes from those who simply volunteered or were recruited to fight for the Taliban. The fighters in Kunduz reportedly include many young men who volunteered after September 11.  Human Rights Watch's call came amid reports of the surrender or defection of thousands of Taliban troops from Kunduz, as the Northern Alliance, also known as the United Front, entered the town on Sunday. Some foreign fighters were among those who surrendered.  “Just as all prisoners, Afghan or non-Afghan, have the right to be treated humanely, so all people responsible for grave violations of international law, Afghan or non-Afghan, must be held accountable for their crimes,” said Jones.  Human Rights Watch said there appears to be a risk that Mullah Dadaullah and Mullah Fazil might be granted amnesty by the Northern Alliance or allowed to escape arrest. Both Afghans were party to surrender negotiations earlier in the week with Northern Alliance commander General Abdul Rashid Dostum. Those negotiations, according to press accounts, included discussions of a general amnesty for Afghan Taliban in Kunduz.  Dadaullah was in command of Taliban forces in June 2001 that burned down thousands of homes and shops in Yakaolang district, in the mainly Shi'a Muslim Hazarajat region, before retreating toward Bamiyan district. Daduallah's forces continued their scorched earth policy as they moved east, destroying homes, markets, and mosques in the western part of Bamiyan district. Most of the civilian population in western Bamiyan fled the Taliban advance, but those who remained behind, as well as some who had encamped in the hills, were summarily executed, according to witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch in August.  Dadaullah is also reportedly responsible for the massacre of Shi'a Muslims in Syedabad in Mazar-i Sharif, in 1998, independent human rights investigators have said, as well as other killings of civilians in northern Afghanistan over the past three years. These investigators cite numerous witness accounts placing Mullah Fazil in a command position inYakaolang during the Taliban occupation of the district in January 2001, when over 170 Shi'a Muslim civilians were detained and summarily executed in public view.  """"Granting amnesty to Dadaullah and Fazil or allowing them to escape arrest will deny the possibility of justice for the victims of Taliban atrocities in northern and central Afghanistan,"""" Jones said. """"It will also signal to commanders and troops throughout Afghanistan that deliberate attacks on civilians and civilian property can be conducted with impunity.""""  An immediate obstacle to prosecution, however, is the absence of a competent justice mechanism in Afghanistan. Prolonged detention without trial would itself violate fundamental guarantees of due process.  As an initial step toward accountability, Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Security Council to request the Secretary General to appoint a commission of experts to gather and analyze evidence of serious violations of international humanitarian law, including war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Afghanistan.

Human Rights Watch, the International Commission of Jurists and the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH) said that the law, based on the principle of """"universal jurisdiction,"""" is needed to prevent the perpetrators of serious international crimes from escaping justice. A 1993 law, amended in 1999, gives Belgian courts the authority to prosecute individuals accused of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of the crimes' connection to Belgium or the accused's presence on Belgian soil. """"The Belgian law is part of a growing trend towards accountability for atrocities,"""" the three groups said. """"Prosecutions based on universal jurisdiction are an essential part of the emerging system of international justice. They help to break down the wall of immunity with which tyrants and torturers protect themselves in their own countries."""" Under the law, complaints have been filed in Belgium against a number of alleged human rights criminals including Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the former dictator of Chad Hissène Habré. In a landmark trial, four Rwandans were convicted in June 2001 by a Belgian jury on charges of involvement in the 1994 genocide in their country. The law has recently come under challenge on three fronts, however.  First, Belgian politicians have argued that the law has turned Belgium into a magnet for all the world's human rights cases. Second, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has brought a case against Belgium before the International Court of Justice arguing that a Belgian arrest warrant for its then-Foreign Minister violates international law.  Finally, in the cases against Sharon and the DRC minister, an appeals court will hear arguments this Wednesday that the law cannot apply to defendants who are not on Belgian soil. Like the laws that permitted General Augusto Pinochet's arrest in London on a warrant from a Spanish judge for crimes committed largely in Chile, the Belgian law is based on the principle of """"universal jurisdiction,"""" applicable to the most egregious atrocities. This mechanism, which was given explicit expression by the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II, recognizes that all states have an interest in bringing to justice the perpetrators of the most serious crimes of international concern, no matter where the crime was committed, and regardless of the nationality of the perpetrators or their victims. A principal reason why international law provides for universal jurisdiction is to ensure that there is no """"safe haven"""" for those responsible for the most serious crimes. According to the groups, the way to avoid having all such cases filed in Belgium is for other countries to adopt similar """"universal jurisdiction"""" legislation rather than cutting back on the Belgian law. Indeed, several other countries already have adopted similar laws as they ratify and implement in their domestic legislation the 1998 Rome treaty for the International Criminal Court. That court will come into effect when 60 states have ratified the treaty, which should happen early next year. Courts in Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Switzerland have already applied laws based on universal jurisdiction to individuals accused of crimes arising out of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda. The groups said that the case of Hissène Habré illustrate the importance that the Belgian law can play in assuring that perpetrators of the worst international crimes are brought to justice. In February 2000, a court in Senegal, where Habré lives in exile, indicted the former Chadian dictator on charges of torture and crimes humanity, and placed him under house arrest. It was the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. In March 2001, however, Senegal's Supreme Court ruled that he could not be tried in Senegal for crimes allegedly committed in Chad because Senegal had not adopted the necessary procedural laws. However a group of Habré' s victims, including several Belgian citizens, are now seeking Habré's extradition to stand trial in Belgium, and the President of Senegal, Abdoulaye Wade, has recently agreed, after a plea by United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, to hold Habré in Senegal pending an extradition request from Belgium. That case is now before Investigating Judge Daniel Fransen of the Brussels district court.","Europe/Central Asia, Belgium",""

For the last two years, there has been an escalation of political violence in Zimbabwe, largely instigated or carried out by supporters of the ruling party, ZANU-PF, against leaders and supporters of opposition parties, in particular the newly formed Movement for Democratic Change (MDC). This violence has been accompanied by increasing harassment of independent critics of government, including journalists. The government has also undermined the independence of the judiciary, forcing several resignations including that of the chief justice. Acquisitions of white-owned commercial farms for redistribution have been accompanied by significant violence against their owners and farm workers, and intimidation and threats against black Zimbabweans living on surrounding communal land. In many cases, police have stood by and taken no action to protect those who have been the victims of violence.   In the last two weeks, there has been a significant escalation of the threats to members of the MDC. According to information received by Human Rights Watch, around eighteen people associated with the MDC are currently in detention in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second city. Among them are security guards, secretaries, and organizers for the party in the Bulawayo area. In addition, MDC member of parliament for Lobengula-Magwegwe and member of the MDC's national executive committee Fletcher Dlamini-Ncube was arrested on November 16, and the MP for Bulilima-Mangwe North, Moses Ndlovu, was arrested on Monday November 19. Both are still in custody. On Thursday November 15, David Coltart, a prominent human rights lawyer and MDC MP from Bulawayo, was detained for several hours at the airport outside the capital, Harare. The MDC has had great difficulty in obtaining access for lawyers to those arrested, in some cases requiring court orders to do so. Some of those in custody are reported to have been tortured.   Both Fletcher Ncube and Moses Ndlovu have been charged with murder in connection with the abduction and killing of Cain Nkala, a leading veteran of Zimbabwe's liberation war and government party supporter. Several of the others arrested have also been charged with murder, and others with offenses under the Law and Order Maintenance Act. The MDC has denied responsibility for the abduction and murder of Nkala, who was linked by police to the murder last year of an MDC official, Patrick Nabanyama. Nkala was reported as saying that he would name the real killers of Nabanyama, leading to speculation by the opposition and in the media that Nkala may have been killed by members of the Central Intelligence Organization (CIO), Zimbabwe's security police. This Sunday, November 18, President Robert Mugabe also publicly singled out three white MDC members whom he declared were """"terrorists""""-MPs David Coltart and Michael Auret, both also long-standing and internationally respected human rights defenders, and Simon Spooner, Coltart's campaign manager during the parliamentary elections of 2000 who is among those now in custody charged with murder.   Last Friday, a hundred or more supporters of ZANU-PF rioted in Bulawayo, beating bystanders and forcing the closure of shops. They were escorted by police in six or seven riot vehicles. The Bulawayo office of the MDC was invaded, as the police stood by, and burnt down with a petrol bomb. The fire brigade who came to assist was stoned by the ZANU-PF supporters. In retaliation, some MDC supporters then burnt down a building belonging to a prominent ZANU-PF politician. Supporters of ZANU-PF have also attacked and set fire to the homes of leading MDC members in Bulawayo. The MDC headquarters in Harare were twice surrounded by a mob of war veterans and other government supporters the previous weekend.   There are also threats to nongovernmental organizations working in Zimbabwe, both on human rights and humanitarian issues. A number of human rights activists and members of other groups critical of the government, including the National Constitutional Assembly (NCA), have received threats or have been assaulted by police, war veterans or supporters of ZANU-PF. An NCA demonstration on Wednesday November 21 intended to be a march on parliament was prevented from going ahead by police, and thirty-five people arrested. Four NCA members were arrested the day before by police to whom they had tried to report assaults by ZANU-PF supporters. The government has stated that humanitarian organizations will be banned from distributing food in rural areas, where there is an acute need for assistance, claiming that aid distribution would be used as an excuse to campaign for the opposition party.   There are serious concerns about the conduct of next year's presidential elections. Proposed new electoral regulations will reportedly place significant difficulties in the way of registering to vote, by requiring voters to produce passports and bills to prove that they have lived in their constituencies for the last twelve months. Postal votes will be limited to diplomatic staff and soldiers serving outside Zimbabwe, preventing other overseas Zimbabweans from casting a ballot. The regulations have not yet been made public, except through reports in the government-owned newspaper, the Herald. The Zimbabwean government has refused to accept election observers from international organizations, including the European Union, and has stated that the only local monitors allowed will be civil servants. NGOs have been forbidden from carrying out voter education. A Public Order and Security Bill has also been mooted in the Herald, which will reportedly dramatically strengthen the powers that the government already holds under the Law and Order Maintenance Act, including denying bail to anyone charged with an offense under the new bill.   The government has also issued new regulations to allow the confiscation of commercial farmland without the right to appeal the decision to the courts, another measure that undermines the rule of law.   In August 2001, in the communiqué following the Blantyre summit of SADC, heads of government expressed their concern at the effect of the economic situation in Zimbabwe on the region. The summit appointed a task force comprising Mozambique, South Africa, and Botswana to work with the Zimbabwe government on the economic and political issues affecting Zimbabwe. Since then, SADC leaders have met with Mugabe to discuss the land crisis and other issues. Now is the time to build on these steps by speaking out strongly at the deteriorating human rights conditions in Zimbabwe, before more lives are lost and the whole region is affected.   Human Rights Watch urges SADC to condemn publicly the current human rights violations in Zimbabwe. In particular, we urge you to call on President Mugabe:  To ensure that the police act impartially to protect all Zimbabwean citizens from violence and that allegations of police complicity in violence, torture or other abuse are impartially investigated and those responsible brought to justice; To end harassment of members of opposition political parties, in particular the MDC, and of human rights and other organizations of civil society; To guarantee the constitutional rights of MDC members and other Zimbabweans held in custody;  To abandon the reported Public Order and Security Bill and new electoral regulations, and other legislation that undermines the rule of law and the rights enshrined in Zimbabwe's constitution; To allow international and national monitors to observe the 2002 presidential elections and to carry out voter education freely before they are held. To withdraw the blanket allegations of """"terrorism"""" made against David Coltart, Michael Auret, and Simon Spooner. The criminal justice system should be allowed to operate without political interference.

At least eighteen members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) are currently in custody, charged with offenses including murder, in connection with the abduction and murder of a leading veteran of Zimbabwe’s liberation war and government party supporter, Cain Nkala. The MDC has denied responsibility for the abduction and murder of Nkala, who was linked by police to the murder last year of an MDC official, Patrick Nabanyama. “It seems this killing is being used as an excuse to crackdown on the opposition,” said Takirambudde. “While the criminal law must take its course, state structures should not be used for political purposes.” Police stood by last week as supporters of the ruling party rioted in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe’s second city, beating bystanders and forcing the closure of shops. The MDC headquarters in Harare were twice surrounded by a mob of people supporting the government the previous weekend. Political conflict has intensified in Zimbabwe since a referendum in February 2000, when people voted against proposed government amendments to the constitution. Violence increased in the run-up to Parliamentary elections held later in 2000. Presidential elections are scheduled for April 2002. MDC supporters and independent journalists have been subjected to increasing harassment and violence. The government has also undermined the independence of the judiciary, forcing the resignation of the chief justice. Acquisitions of white-owned commercial farms have been accompanied by significant violence against their owners and farm workers and intimidation and threats against black Zimbabweans living on surrounding communal land.","Africa, Botswana, Malawi, Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe",""

According to government sources, Pentagon officials this month recommended that the U.S. abandon its standing commitment to join the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty by 2006 if alternatives to antipersonnel mines are identified and fielded.  """"The existing U.S. policy to eliminate antipersonnel mines over time appears to be in jeopardy,"""" said Mark Hiznay, senior researcher in Human Rights Watch's arms division.  The Pentagon's review is one component of a multi-agency landmine policy review. Officials in the Department of State and the National Security Council will now join the review prior to a decision by President Bush, which may occur by the end of 2001.  Such a policy shift would also do away with a decision made in 1998 to discontinue the use of antipersonnel mines not packaged with antivehicle mines in delivery canisters, except in Korea, by 2003.  """"A reversal of the 2003 deadline frees up 86 percent of the current 11.2 million mine stockpile for use in the future,"""" Hiznay said.  Inside the Army, a weekly newsletter on Army affairs, recently reported that the Army has zeroed-out funding in its 2003-2007 spending plan for one of the three tracks of the landmine alternatives program -- the NSD-A and RADAM programs. RADAM would be a new artillery-delivered system combining existing ADAM antipersonnel mines and existing RAAMS antivehicle mines. NSD-A (Non-Self-Destructing antipersonnel mine Alternative) aims at replacement for so-called dumb mines.  """"The fact the Army wants to kill NSD-A, the most promising landmine alternative developed so far, before the landmine review is complete is another sign of the Pentagon's push to abandon current policy,"""" Hiznay added.  The Pentagon is apparently also proposing to ditch a second track of its alternatives program -- the search for alternatives for so-called mixed systems that contain both antipersonnel and antivehicle mines. Though focused on tanks, these systems run afoul of the Mine Ban Treaty because they contain antipersonnel mines that an individual can set off.  Human Rights Watch believes that in any meaningful review the Bush Administration should reject the Pentagon's recommendation to abandon current policy and commitments. The presumption that antipersonnel mines are essential, as reportedly stated in the Pentagon review, should not be accepted without critical examination.  Human Rights Watch distributed a memorandum highlighting key issues and questions regarding the U.S. landmine policy review to the Bush Administration in June 2001.","United States","Arms, Landmines"

Like many nations, India is facing heightened national security concerns arising from the September 11 attacks and U.S.-led military strikes in the region. In a letter addressed to EU President and Belgian Prime Minister Verhofstadt, European Commission President Prodi, EU Foreign and Development Ministers and Commissioners Patten, Nielson and Lamy and CFSP High Representative Solana, Human Rights Watch urged the E.U. to caution the Indian government against ill-considered changes to Indian law and policy that would unnecessarily erode basic rights to personal liberty in the name of fighting terrorism.  The Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO), currently being debated in Indian parliament, gives Indian police sweeping powers of arrest and detention. POTO has been strongly criticized by leading Indian civil rights groups, academics, lawyers, opposition parties, media organizations, and the country's National Human Rights Commission.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/21/morocco/western-sahara-36-human-rights-defenders-acquitted","Morocco-Western Sahara- 36 Human Rights Defenders Acquitted","Morocco/Western Sahara: 36 Human Rights Defenders Acquitted","","11/21/2001","On 21 November 2001 the Court of Appeal in Rabat acquitted 36 human rights defenders who had been sentenced earlier in the year to three months in prison for “participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration” on 9 December 2000. The rally had been called to demand an end to impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses in the country.  Although the decision to quash their sentences meant the activists were spared imprisonment, their trial and conviction confirmed the need for the Moroccan authorities to ensure that the right to freedom of assembly is guaranteed.  At the time of writing, the appeal court’s written ruling had not yet been issued. This case has focused attention on Morocco’s record on human rights under King Mohamed VI.  The King has taken a number of welcome steps since acceding to the throne in July 1999.  These include the establishment of an arbitration commission to decide on compensation for certain victims of “disappearance” and arbitrary detention in previous decades, and the release of several prisoners detained solely on account of the peaceful expression of their political beliefs. Such steps have built on the significant improvements which the country has seen in its human rights situation since the early 1990s. However, the right to assemble peacefully remains sharply curtailed. It is critical that this right be protected as Morocco prepares for parliamentary elections that have been scheduled for September 2002, which King Mohamed VI has pledged will be impartial. Also at stake in this case was the right to challenge impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses.  At one level, this is the right to demand that the state identify and hold accountable alleged perpetrators of hundreds of cases of “disappearance,” torture, and prolonged illegal detention in previous decades.  At another level, this concerns the impunity of the police who brutally beat the demonstrators before arresting them, and the lack of investigations into excessive force used by the Moroccan police in dispersing peaceful public gatherings. Arrest and trial On the evening of 9 December 2000, plainclothes and uniformed police descended upon persons planning to hold a rally in front of the parliament building in downtown Rabat.  The rally had been organized by the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (Association marocaine des droits humains, AMDH), on the eve of International Human Rights Day, to demand an end to impunity for human rights abuses.  The activists planned to protest under the slogan, “We demand that the truth be revealed and that those responsible for abductions, illegal arrests and acts of torture be brought to justice.” The protest was one of many staged in the last two years by civil society organizations.  Demands for a truth and justice commission, state acknowledgement of its role in “disappearances” and other grave abuses in previous decades, and reparations for victims and their families have intensified as the margins for free expression have widened and the authorities have sought to improve the country’s human rights record. On 9 December, police arrested 46 persons, many of them before they had even reached the site of the planned rally.  They also confiscated the banners, posters and photos the demonstrators had been carrying. The police released four of those arrested the same evening, and held the other 42 overnight.  On 10 December, they were taken before the state prosecutor, who released six of them without charge.  The remaining 36 were brought before the Rabat Court of First Instance on 11 December.  All were charged on two counts: “participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration” under Articles 11 and 14 of the 1958 Law on Public Assemblies and “participating in an unarmed assembly in a public thoroughfare,” under Articles 17 and 21 of the same law.  The first charge carried a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 7,000 dirhams (US $630); the second charge a maximum sentence of one month in prison.  The court scheduled the trial for 28 February 2001. The defendants were mostly human rights activists, including the AMDH’s president at the time, Abderrahmane Benameur, its vice president, Amine Abdelhamid (later elected president to replace Benameur), the association’s treasurer, Lahcen Khattar, and many AMDH members from around the country.  Also arrested were Khedija Rouissi, secretary-general of the Forum for Truth and Justice, and Lahcen Moutik, a member of the Forum’s executive committee, along with Brahim Sebbar and Seddik Bellahi of the Coordinating Committee of the Group of Sahrawi Victims of Forced Disappearance and Arbitrary Detention. Well before the planned rally, the AMDH had sparked controversy by publicly naming officials allegedly implicated in grave human rights abuses in previous decades and demanding they be held accountable.  On 23 October 2000, the association sent an open letter to Minister of Justice Omar Azzimane, urging him to initiate proceedings against 14 officials, including Hosni Benslimane, the chief of the gendarmerie, and Hamid Laanigri, director of the National Security Bureau, an internal police agency, and parliament deputy Mahmoud Archane.  Most of the remaining persons named as perpetrators were retired.  Neither Benslimane nor Laanigri responded formally to the accusations; Archane, in statements published in the press, said he had always served his country and observed the laws.  On 4 December 2000 the AMDH addressed an open letter to parliament, asking it to form a commission of inquiry, in accordance with Article 42 of the Constitution, to investigate 16 men named in the letter as responsible for “disappearances” and torture.  The letter added two names to the 14 cited in the October letter addressed to the Justice Minister.  The AMDH declared that there were victims willing to testify against the accused before a parliamentary commission.  Neither the government nor the parliament responded officially to the AMDH letters.[1] The AMDH informed the wali (governor) of Rabat-Salé, in a letter dated 6 December 2000, of its intention to hold a peaceful sit-in from 8:00 to 8:30pm on 9 December in front of the parliament building.  The wali replied to the AMDH in a letter dated 8 December that he was forbidding the sit-in for unspecified security reasons. The AMDH went ahead with its plan to hold the sit-in.  As the defendants were to argue later before the court, they believed that, under Moroccan law, a peaceful sit-in that does not obstruct traffic requires no prior authorization.  They had informed the wali of their plans, they said, not to seek his permission but simply as a matter of courtesy. The Court of First Instance rejected this interpretation of the law.  On 16 May it rendered its verdict, convicting all 36 of “participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration,” and sentencing each defendant to three months in prison and a fine of 3,000 dirhams.  All were acquitted of the second charge.  An appeal was planned and the 36 remained at liberty pending a definitive ruling on their case. On 11 June, the first date before the Court of Appeal, the trial was postponed until 17 September.  After sessions on that date and on 16 October, the court issued its verdict on 21 November. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch sent observers to both the trial in first instance and the appeal trial.  Hachemi Jegham, a human rights lawyer and chair of Amnesty International’s Tunisian Section, monitored the session on 28 February 2001 on behalf of Amnesty International, as did Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, who was sent jointly by Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights.  During the appeal trial, Egyptian human rights lawyer Mahmoud Kandil attended the session of 17 September 2001 on behalf of both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.  Police brutality during arrest “Sit-ins” in the Moroccan context differ from sit-ins as they are commonly understood in some other countries.  Participants generally gather and stand or sit at a location and hold up signs and chant slogans.  Most sit-ins in Morocco are not acts whose purpose is to obstruct or intimidate those who pass by.  The sit-in called by the AMDH is a case in point.  It was planned for the wide strip of grass that lies in the middle of the boulevard running past the grounds of the parliament building. According to the prosecution, the local police had been informed that an unauthorized demonstration was taking place and, after arriving at the scene, ordered the crowd to disperse using a loudspeaker.  When the order to disperse was ignored and as protesters chanted slogans against impunity, members of the security forces were ordered to make arrests, the prosecution maintained. The defendants challenged this account of events, and when presented with police statements that reflected the official account of events, the defendants refused to sign them.  Instead, they claimed in court on 11 December that security force personnel were waiting for them as they approached the location of the gathering at 8pm and began to disperse them violently without giving an audible order beforehand.  Other activists were chased and arrested as they approached the site from different directions.  In addition, when a small number of them re-grouped on the sidewalk three blocks away, near the AMDH’s headquarters, police charged and beat some of them, and made further arrests.  When defence lawyers sought during the trial to summon witnesses to corroborate the defendants’ account, the judge denied their request, pointing out that the prosecution’s account came from police reports prepared on the basis of the testimony of a police officer who had witnessed the events in question.  By law, he added, such reports can only be challenged by making the contention that they are forged.  Article 294 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states: “No one is permitted to use witnesses to present evidence which is superfluous to or contradicts the contents of reports prepared by functionaries or agents, whose inquiries are considered reliable, according to the terms of the law, and cannot be challenged except with the contention that they are forged.  If this is breached, it follows that the evidence is invalid.” All of those arrested claim they were physically assaulted by members of the security forces in the streets.  Some allege that they were punched, kicked, and insulted, others that they were beaten with clubs or sticks.  One of the defendants, Abdelilah Benabdessalam, underwent an independent medical examination on his release.  The medical report, dated 11 December 2000, described bruises on his head, back and ankle and declared him incapable of working for a period of 25 days. When questioned on 9 and 10 December, those arrested showed the police and state prosecutor the injuries they had sustained.  However, their requests for a medical examination were not granted.  When they repeated these requests in court the following day, they were again refused.  The defence argued that this succession of refusals violated the Code of Criminal Procedure, which stipulates in Article 127, “… the examining magistrate must submit the accused to an examination by a medical expert when this is requested of him or on his own initiative if he himself notices marks which justify this.” The trial court’s written ruling, issued after the verdict was announced on 16 May, stated that the state prosecutor had observed cuts and bruises on some of the defendants.  But no medical examination was required since the injuries were inflicted prior to the period of detention.  The court was apparently drawing a distinction between force used during custody, which could have tainted statements made by the defendants that were introduced as evidence, and force used prior to taking the defendants into custody.  The injuries, wrote the court, “are attributable to the situation and circumstances of events which required the intervention of the security forces to arrest them and to prevent them from holding what they called a sit-in protest.  This does not warrant in any way their being presented for a medical examination.” The U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment urges a prompt medical examination under all circumstances.  Adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 1988, the Body of Principles states in Principle 24: “A proper medical examination shall be offered to a detained or imprisoned person as promptly as possible after his admission to the place of detention or imprisonment, and thereafter medical care and treatment shall be provided whenever necessary.” Even when presented with evidence of the excessive force used by the police in the streets against the defendants, neither the state prosecutor nor the investigating judge handling the case saw fit to order an investigation.  To this day, the brutality of the police against the participants has not been investigated.  “Sit-in” or “demonstration”: the legal debate During the trial, the prosecution contended that what had been organized in front of the parliament building on the evening of 9 December 2001 was a “demonstration.”  The defence argued that this had not been a “demonstration” but a “peaceful sit-in” scheduled to last for half an hour. The defence argued that the wali’s order forbidding a “sit-in” was illegal.  Since the Law on Public Assemblies does not mention the word “sit-in,” either to criminalize or explicitly permit it, a “peaceful sit-in” can be organized and held without advance permission or notification.  The defence argued that a “sit-in” involved a rally in a fixed place, while a “demonstration” involved movement along a public thoroughfare.  They cited a 1999 ruling of Morocco’s Supreme Court[2] that classified the gathering of people in one place as merely an “assembly,” in contrast to a “demonstration,” which involved the collective movement of people through streets.  In that case, the Supreme Court overturned the 1995 conviction by the Court of Appeal of el-Jadida of a group of people who had apparently assembled in front of a local administration building chanting slogans.  The defendants had been convicted of participating in an unauthorized demonstration and gathering in a public thoroughfare. The judge trying the 36 human rights activists declined to accept the distinction drawn by the Supreme Court, and ruled instead that a “peaceful sit-in” should be classified, within the context of the law, as a “demonstration.”  The court’s written ruling explained that it was not legally bound to apply to the facts at hand a holding of the Supreme Court when it was not persuaded by the higher court’s reasoning. However the term “demonstration” is interpreted within the context of Morocco’s domestic legislation, the Moroccan authorities violated the right to freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Morocco has ratified.  Article 21 of the ICCPR states: “The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized.  No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.” The authorities invoked “security reasons” to ban the AMDH sit-in, but did not specify them in any way.  Given the AMDH’s history of non-violence and the proposed nature of the AMDH action, it is difficult to see how its interdiction could be deemed “necessary in a democratic society” to protect national security, public safety, or any of the other interests laid out in the ICCPR. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch believe, furthermore, that the police used excessive force in preventing the sit-in from taking place, and should be held accountable for their actions.  The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the U.N.  in 1990, contain the following provisions: “12.  As everyone is allowed to participate in lawful and peaceful assemblies, in accordance with the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Governments and law enforcement agencies and officials shall recognize that force and firearms may be used only in accordance with principles 13 and 14.  13.  In the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict such force to the minimum extent necessary.” [3] The right to demonstrate in Morocco Morocco’s restrictions on public gatherings go well beyond the narrowly defined grounds provided in the ICCPR.  Under Article 13 of the 1958 Law on Public Assemblies, organizers of a demonstration must obtain advance authorization from the authorities, who may forbid them from holding it if they “determine that the planned demonstration is liable to disturb the public order.” Armed or unarmed gatherings on public thoroughfares “capable of disturbing the public order” can be prohibited and dispersed, according to Articles 17 and 19 of the same law.  Nowhere does Moroccan law define what constitutes a disturbance to the public order, leaving its interpretation in the hands of authorities.  That wide discretion is frequently used to forbid or disperse political demonstrations, although rallies, including large ones, are sometimes permitted to take place. Peaceful gatherings such as that of the human rights activists of 9 December 2000 are often broken up by the police, particularly when the demands being made relate to sensitive issues.  In many instances participants are beaten and arrested by the security forces, and then prosecuted on charges related to participating in “unauthorized” gatherings. On 14 November, police forcibly broke up a sit-in by teachers staged outside the Ministry of Finance in Rabat to demand that the authorities fulfil agreements reached with their unions.  On 18 October 2001 the Interior Ministry banned a demonstration called for 21 October in Rabat to protest U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan.  In June and July, the Ministry prevented Berber rights groups from holding a meeting and a conference.  On 12 January the Ministry banned a demonstration called by human rights organizations in front of Dar al-Mokri, a former secret detention centre in Rabat.  Throughout the year, police sometimes tolerated, sometimes broke up the frequent sit-ins and rallies staged by groups representing unemployed workers in search of jobs. On 10 December 2000, the day following the rally against impunity in front of the parliament building, members and sympathizers of the Islamist organization al-‘Adl wa’l-Ihsan (Justice and Charity) demonstrated in cities across the country to protest against police harassment and restrictions on the organization’s newspapers, al-‘Adl wa’l-Ihsan and Risalat al-Futouwa (The Youth Message).  According to the demonstrations’ organizers, they had sought advance authorization, in compliance with Article 12 of the Law on Public Assemblies, but did not receive it.  Al-‘Adl wa’l-Ihsan is an organization that the government has declined to legally authorize but generally tolerates.  Police broke up the demonstrations and arrested participants in at least seven cities.  Although the fact that hundreds of protesters were out on the streets meant that there was considerable disruption in many of the cities, the demonstrations were non-violent before they were dispersed.  In Rabat, where the police were filmed beating the participants, some 200 were detained and around 100 injured, according to al-‘Adl wa’l-Ihsan.  In some parts of the footage taken, small groups of policemen could be seen repeatedly beating demonstrators who had already been apprehended with batons on the head and other parts of the body.  In Casablanca, some 400 were detained and over 300 allegedly injured.  In Fez, el-Jadida, Marrakesh, Oujda, and Agadir, it was reported that a total of about 500 protesters were detained and over 300 injured. Some 130 participants in these demonstrations were charged and brought to trial.  Most of them were convicted of staging unauthorized demonstrations.  In some cases, defendants were charged with resisting and assaulting members of the security forces, and in a few were also charged with carrying a weapon.  Those concerned were sentenced to up to one year in prison, but all are presently free, either because they have appealed their conviction or because an appeal court has reduced the sentence to a suspended prison term. Impunity In Morocco / Western Sahara, both civil society and state institutions are engaged in a lively debate over how to reckon with the legacy of gross human rights abuses committed during the reign of the late King Hassan II, notably during efforts to suppress leftist dissidents and advocates of self-determination for the disputed territory of Western Sahara between the 1960s and 1980s.  These abuses included hundreds of cases of “disappearances” that remain unresolved today, prolonged arbitrary detention, torture and long-term imprisonment on political charges. Although the subject of impunity is no longer taboo, as it was during most of King Hassan II’s reign, it is still a sensitive matter.  The Moroccan authorities’ reaction to the rally organized by the AMDH for 9 December 2000, which called explicitly for those responsible for the grave human rights violations of the past to be brought to justice, is evidence of that. In the 1990s, King Hassan II took a number of measures to improve human rights conditions.  In 1998, upon instructions from the King, the official Human Rights Advisory Board (Conseil consultatif des droits de l’homme, CCDH) issued a list of 112 “disappeared” persons, of whom 56 were said to have died in detention.  In August 1999, one month after succeeding his father on the throne, Mohamed VI recognized, in very general terms, the state’s responsibility in “disappearances” and established an arbitration commission to compensate victims and their survivors in cases of “disappearance” and prolonged arbitrary detention. Morocco’s acknowledgment of state responsibility for grave abuses of human rights and its commitment to compensate some victims are welcome initial steps towards addressing the legacy of the past.  Nevertheless, they have provoked debate and criticism, including from persons eligible for compensation who declared that they would boycott the process.  Among the criticisms is that the arbitration commission was established without any accompanying effort to investigate and reveal the truth about grave human rights violations or to identify or hold accountable their perpetrators.  To date, no official has been brought to justice for participating in the repression of the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s. The CCDH has given assurances that people who receive compensation have not forfeited their right to pursue remedies through other avenues, such as the courts.  Those who apply for compensation do, however, have to sign a waiver recognizing that the arbitration commission’s decision on their claim is definitive and subject to no appeal. Fearful that the government would attempt to “close the book” on the abuses of the past by financially compensating a narrow category of victims, in late 1999 a group of former prisoners, victims’ relatives, and human rights activists created the Forum for Truth and Justice.  That group has since been at the forefront of demands that any national reckoning of the past include establishment of an independent truth commission and a coherent approach to holding accountable those implicated in the abuses. During 2000, the AMDH vigorously campaigned for abusers to be held accountable.  They went so far as to name several individuals whom they believed were responsible for torture or “disappearances,” and urge that they be brought to justice. On 9-11 November 2001, the AMDH, the Forum for Truth and Justice, and the Moroccan Human Rights Organization organized a national symposium on grave human rights violations.  In the event's concluding declaration, the organizations stated, “We reaffirm that the objective and sound resolution of cases of grave violations requires … the recognition of truths, and that the page on the past cannot be turned without satisfying the victims and uncovering the truth.” Recommendations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch urge the Moroccan authorities to:  Respect in practice the U.N.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/21/morocco/western-sahara-freedom-assembly-trial","Morocco - Western Sahara- Freedom of assembly on trial","Morocco / Western Sahara: Freedom of assembly on trial","","11/21/2001","On 21 November 2001 the Court of Appeal in Rabat acquitted 36 human rights defenders who had been sentenced earlier in the year to three months in prison for """"participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration"""" on 9 December 2000. The rally had been called to demand an end to impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses in the country.  Although the decision to quash their sentences meant the activists were spared imprisonment, their trial and conviction confirmed the need for the Moroccan authorities to ensure that the right to freedom of assembly is guaranteed.  At the time of writing, the appeal court's written ruling had not yet been issued.   This case has focused attention on Morocco's record on human rights under King Mohamed VI.  The King has taken a number of welcome steps since acceding to the throne in July 1999.  These include the establishment of an arbitration commission to decide on compensation for certain victims of """"disappearance"""" and arbitrary detention in previous decades, and the release of several prisoners detained solely on account of the peaceful expression of their political beliefs. Such steps have built on the significant improvements which the country has seen in its human rights situation since the early 1990s.   However, the right to assemble peacefully remains sharply curtailed. It is critical that this right be protected as Morocco prepares for parliamentary elections that have been scheduled for September 2002, which King Mohamed VI has pledged will be impartial. Also at stake in this case was the right to challenge impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses.  At one level, this is the right to demand that the state identify and hold accountable alleged perpetrators of hundreds of cases of """"disappearance,"""" torture, and prolonged illegal detention in previous decades.  At another level, this concerns the impunity of the police who brutally beat the demonstrators before arresting them, and the lack of investigations into excessive force used by the Moroccan police in dispersing peaceful public gatherings.  Arrest and trial  On the evening of 9 December 2000, plainclothes and uniformed police descended upon persons planning to hold a rally in front of the parliament building in downtown Rabat.  The rally had been organized by the Moroccan Association of Human Rights (Association marocaine des droits humains, AMDH), on the eve of International Human Rights Day, to demand an end to impunity for human rights abuses.  The activists planned to protest under the slogan, """"We demand that the truth be revealed and that those responsible for abductions, illegal arrests and acts of torture be brought to justice.""""   The protest was one of many staged in the last two years by civil society organizations.  Demands for a truth and justice commission, state acknowledgement of its role in """"disappearances"""" and other grave abuses in previous decades, and reparations for victims and their families have intensified as the margins for free expression have widened and the authorities have sought to improve the country's human rights record.   On 9 December, police arrested 46 persons, many of them before they had even reached the site of the planned rally.  They also confiscated the banners, posters and photos the demonstrators had been carrying.   The police released four of those arrested the same evening, and held the other 42 overnight.  On 10 December, they were taken before the state prosecutor, who released six of them without charge.  The remaining 36 were brought before the Rabat Court of First Instance on 11 December.  All were charged on two counts: """"participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration"""" under Articles 11 and 14 of the 1958 Law on Public Assemblies and """"participating in an unarmed assembly in a public thoroughfare,"""" under Articles 17 and 21 of the same law.  The first charge carried a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of 7,000 dirhams (US $630); the second charge a maximum sentence of one month in prison.  The court scheduled the trial for 28 February 2001.   The defendants were mostly human rights activists, including the AMDH's president at the time, Abderrahmane Benameur, its vice president, Amine Abdelhamid (later elected president to replace Benameur), the association's treasurer, Lahcen Khattar, and many AMDH members from around the country.  Also arrested were Khedija Rouissi, secretary-general of the Forum for Truth and Justice, and Lahcen Moutik, a member of the Forum's executive committee, along with Brahim Sebbar and Seddik Bellahi of the Coordinating Committee of the Group of Sahrawi Victims of Forced Disappearance and Arbitrary Detention.   Well before the planned rally, the AMDH had sparked controversy by publicly naming officials allegedly implicated in grave human rights abuses in previous decades and demanding they be held accountable.  On 23 October 2000, the association sent an open letter to Minister of Justice Omar Azzimane, urging him to initiate proceedings against 14 officials, including Hosni Benslimane, the chief of the gendarmerie, and Hamid Laanigri, director of the National Security Bureau, an internal police agency, and parliament deputy Mahmoud Archane.  Most of the remaining persons named as perpetrators were retired.  Neither Benslimane nor Laanigri responded formally to the accusations; Archane, in statements published in the press, said he had always served his country and observed the laws.    On 4 December 2000 the AMDH addressed an open letter to parliament, asking it to form a commission of inquiry, in accordance with Article 42 of the Constitution, to investigate 16 men named in the letter as responsible for """"disappearances"""" and torture.  The letter added two names to the 14 cited in the October letter addressed to the Justice Minister.  The AMDH declared that there were victims willing to testify against the accused before a parliamentary commission.  Neither the government nor the parliament responded officially to the AMDH letters.[1]   The AMDH informed the wali (governor) of Rabat-Salé, in a letter dated 6 December 2000, of its intention to hold a peaceful sit-in from 8:00 to 8:30pm on 9 December in front of the parliament building.  The wali replied to the AMDH in a letter dated 8 December that he was forbidding the sit-in for unspecified security reasons.   The AMDH went ahead with its plan to hold the sit-in.  As the defendants were to argue later before the court, they believed that, under Moroccan law, a peaceful sit-in that does not obstruct traffic requires no prior authorization.  They had informed the wali of their plans, they said, not to seek his permission but simply as a matter of courtesy.   The Court of First Instance rejected this interpretation of the law.  On 16 May it rendered its verdict, convicting all 36 of """"participating in the organization of an unauthorized demonstration,"""" and sentencing each defendant to three months in prison and a fine of 3,000 dirhams.  All were acquitted of the second charge.  An appeal was planned and the 36 remained at liberty pending a definitive ruling on their case.   On 11 June, the first date before the Court of Appeal, the trial was postponed until 17 September.  After sessions on that date and on 16 October, the court issued its verdict on 21 November.   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch sent observers to both the trial in first instance and the appeal trial.  Hachemi Jegham, a human rights lawyer and chair of Amnesty International's Tunisian Section, monitored the session on 28 February 2001 on behalf of Amnesty International, as did Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, who was sent jointly by Human Rights Watch and the International Federation for Human Rights.  During the appeal trial, Egyptian human rights lawyer Mahmoud Kandil attended the session of 17 September 2001 on behalf of both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.   Police brutality during arrest  """"Sit-ins"""" in the Moroccan context differ from sit-ins as they are commonly understood in some other countries.  Participants generally gather and stand or sit at a location and hold up signs and chant slogans.  Most sit-ins in Morocco are not acts whose purpose is to obstruct or intimidate those who pass by.  The sit-in called by the AMDH is a case in point.  It was planned for the wide strip of grass that lies in the middle of the boulevard running past the grounds of the parliament building.   According to the prosecution, the local police had been informed that an unauthorized demonstration was taking place and, after arriving at the scene, ordered the crowd to disperse using a loudspeaker.  When the order to disperse was ignored and as protesters chanted slogans against impunity, members of the security forces were ordered to make arrests, the prosecution maintained.   The defendants challenged this account of events, and when presented with police statements that reflected the official account of events, the defendants refused to sign them.  Instead, they claimed in court on 11 December that security force personnel were waiting for them as they approached the location of the gathering at 8pm and began to disperse them violently without giving an audible order beforehand.  Other activists were chased and arrested as they approached the site from different directions.  In addition, when a small number of them re-grouped on the sidewalk three blocks away, near the AMDH's headquarters, police charged and beat some of them, and made further arrests.  When defence lawyers sought during the trial to summon witnesses to corroborate the defendants' account, the judge denied their request, pointing out that the prosecution's account came from police reports prepared on the basis of the testimony of a police officer who had witnessed the events in question.  By law, he added, such reports can only be challenged by making the contention that they are forged.  Article 294 of the Code of Criminal Procedure states:   """"No one is permitted to use witnesses to present evidence which is superfluous to or contradicts the contents of reports prepared by functionaries or agents, whose inquiries are considered reliable, according to the terms of the law, and cannot be challenged except with the contention that they are forged.  If this is breached, it follows that the evidence is invalid.""""   All of those arrested claim they were physically assaulted by members of the security forces in the streets.  Some allege that they were punched, kicked, and insulted, others that they were beaten with clubs or sticks.  One of the defendants, Abdelilah Benabdessalam, underwent an independent medical examination on his release.  The medical report, dated 11 December 2000, described bruises on his head, back and ankle and declared him incapable of working for a period of 25 days.   When questioned on 9 and 10 December, those arrested showed the police and state prosecutor the injuries they had sustained.  However, their requests for a medical examination were not granted.  When they repeated these requests in court the following day, they were again refused.  The defence argued that this succession of refusals violated the Code of Criminal Procedure, which stipulates in Article 127, """"... the examining magistrate must submit the accused to an examination by a medical expert when this is requested of him or on his own initiative if he himself notices marks which justify this.""""   The trial court's written ruling, issued after the verdict was announced on 16 May, stated that the state prosecutor had observed cuts and bruises on some of the defendants.  But no medical examination was required since the injuries were inflicted prior to the period of detention.  The court was apparently drawing a distinction between force used during custody, which could have tainted statements made by the defendants that were introduced as evidence, and force used prior to taking the defendants into custody.  The injuries, wrote the court, """"are attributable to the situation and circumstances of events which required the intervention of the security forces to arrest them and to prevent them from holding what they called a sit-in protest.  This does not warrant in any way their being presented for a medical examination.""""   The U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of all Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment urges a prompt medical examination under all circumstances.  Adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 1988, the Body of Principles states in Principle 24:   """"A proper medical examination shall be offered to a detained or imprisoned person as promptly as possible after his admission to the place of detention or imprisonment, and thereafter medical care and treatment shall be provided whenever necessary.""""   Even when presented with evidence of the excessive force used by the police in the streets against the defendants, neither the state prosecutor nor the investigating judge handling the case saw fit to order an investigation.  To this day, the brutality of the police against the participants has not been investigated.   """"Sit-in"""" or """"demonstration"""": the legal debate  During the trial, the prosecution contended that what had been organized in front of the parliament building on the evening of 9 December 2001 was a """"demonstration.""""  The defence argued that this had not been a """"demonstration"""" but a """"peaceful sit-in"""" scheduled to last for half an hour.   The defence argued that the wali's order forbidding a """"sit-in"""" was illegal.  Since the Law on Public Assemblies does not mention the word """"sit-in,"""" either to criminalize or explicitly permit it, a """"peaceful sit-in"""" can be organized and held without advance permission or notification.  The defence argued that a """"sit-in"""" involved a rally in a fixed place, while a """"demonstration"""" involved movement along a public thoroughfare.  They cited a 1999 ruling of Morocco's Supreme Court[2] that classified the gathering of people in one place as merely an """"assembly,"""" in contrast to a """"demonstration,"""" which involved the collective movement of people through streets.  In that case, the Supreme Court overturned the 1995 conviction by the Court of Appeal of el-Jadida of a group of people who had apparently assembled in front of a local administration building chanting slogans.  The defendants had been convicted of participating in an unauthorized demonstration and gathering in a public thoroughfare.   The judge trying the 36 human rights activists declined to accept the distinction drawn by the Supreme Court, and ruled instead that a """"peaceful sit-in"""" should be classified, within the context of the law, as a """"demonstration.""""  The court's written ruling explained that it was not legally bound to apply to the facts at hand a holding of the Supreme Court when it was not persuaded by the higher court's reasoning.   However the term """"demonstration"""" is interpreted within the context of Morocco's domestic legislation, the Moroccan authorities violated the right to freedom of assembly guaranteed by Article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which Morocco has ratified.  Article 21 of the ICCPR states:   """"The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognized.  No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.""""    The authorities invoked """"security reasons"""" to ban the AMDH sit-in, but did not specify them in any way.  Given the AMDH's history of non-violence and the proposed nature of the AMDH action, it is difficult to see how its interdiction could be deemed """"necessary in a democratic society"""" to protect national security, public safety, or any of the other interests laid out in the ICCPR.   Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch believe, furthermore, that the police used excessive force in preventing the sit-in from taking place, and should be held accountable for their actions.    The Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, adopted by the U.N.  in 1990, contain the following provisions:   """"12.  As everyone is allowed to participate in lawful and peaceful assemblies, in accordance with the principles embodied in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Governments and law enforcement agencies and officials shall recognize that force and firearms may be used only in accordance with principles 13 and 14.     13.  In the dispersal of assemblies that are unlawful but non-violent, law enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force or, where that is not practicable, shall restrict such force to the minimum extent necessary."""" [3]  The right to demonstrate in Morocco  Morocco's restrictions on public gatherings go well beyond the narrowly defined grounds provided in the ICCPR.  Under Article 13 of the 1958 Law on Public Assemblies, organizers of a demonstration must obtain advance authorization from the authorities, who may forbid them from holding it if they """"determine that the planned demonstration is liable to disturb the public order."""" Armed or unarmed gatherings on public thoroughfares """"capable of disturbing the public order"""" can be prohibited and dispersed, according to Articles 17 and 19 of the same law.  Nowhere does Moroccan law define what constitutes a disturbance to the public order, leaving its interpretation in the hands of authorities.  That wide discretion is frequently used to forbid or disperse political demonstrations, although rallies, including large ones, are sometimes permitted to take place.   Peaceful gatherings such as that of the human rights activists of 9 December 2000 are often broken up by the police, particularly when the demands being made relate to sensitive issues.  In many instances participants are beaten and arrested by the security forces, and then prosecuted on charges related to participating in """"unauthorized"""" gatherings.   On 14 November, police forcibly broke up a sit-in by teachers staged outside the Ministry of Finance in Rabat to demand that the authorities fulfil agreements reached with their unions.  On 18 October 2001 the Interior Ministry banned a demonstration called for 21 October in Rabat to protest U.S. air strikes in Afghanistan.  In June and July, the Ministry prevented Berber rights groups from holding a meeting and a conference.  On 12 January the Ministry banned a demonstration called by human rights organizations in front of Dar al-Mokri, a former secret detention centre in Rabat.  Throughout the year, police sometimes tolerated, sometimes broke up the frequent sit-ins and rallies staged by groups representing unemployed workers in search of jobs.   On 10 December 2000, the day following the rally against impunity in front of the parliament building, members and sympathizers of the Islamist organization al-‘Adl wa'l-Ihsan (Justice and Charity) demonstrated in cities across the country to protest against police harassment and restrictions on the organization's newspapers, al-‘Adl wa'l-Ihsan and Risalat al-Futouwa (The Youth Message).  According to the demonstrations' organizers, they had sought advance authorization, in compliance with Article 12 of the Law on Public Assemblies, but did not receive it.  Al-‘Adl wa'l-Ihsan is an organization that the government has declined to legally authorize but generally tolerates.    Police broke up the demonstrations and arrested participants in at least seven cities.  Although the fact that hundreds of protesters were out on the streets meant that there was considerable disruption in many of the cities, the demonstrations were non-violent before they were dispersed.    In Rabat, where the police were filmed beating the participants, some 200 were detained and around 100 injured, according to al-‘Adl wa'l-Ihsan.  In some parts of the footage taken, small groups of policemen could be seen repeatedly beating demonstrators who had already been apprehended with batons on the head and other parts of the body.  In Casablanca, some 400 were detained and over 300 allegedly injured.  In Fez, el-Jadida, Marrakesh, Oujda, and Agadir, it was reported that a total of about 500 protesters were detained and over 300 injured.   Some 130 participants in these demonstrations were charged and brought to trial.  Most of them were convicted of staging unauthorized demonstrations.  In some cases, defendants were charged with resisting and assaulting members of the security forces, and in a few were also charged with carrying a weapon.  Those concerned were sentenced to up to one year in prison, but all are presently free, either because they have appealed their conviction or because an appeal court has reduced the sentence to a suspended prison term.  Impunity  In Morocco / Western Sahara, both civil society and state institutions are engaged in a lively debate over how to reckon with the legacy of gross human rights abuses committed during the reign of the late King Hassan II, notably during efforts to suppress leftist dissidents and advocates of self-determination for the disputed territory of Western Sahara between the 1960s and 1980s.  These abuses included hundreds of cases of """"disappearances"""" that remain unresolved today, prolonged arbitrary detention, torture and long-term imprisonment on political charges.   Although the subject of impunity is no longer taboo, as it was during most of King Hassan II's reign, it is still a sensitive matter.  The Moroccan authorities' reaction to the rally organized by the AMDH for 9 December 2000, which called explicitly for those responsible for the grave human rights violations of the past to be brought to justice, is evidence of that.   In the 1990s, King Hassan II took a number of measures to improve human rights conditions.  In 1998, upon instructions from the King, the official Human Rights Advisory Board (Conseil consultatif des droits de l'homme, CCDH) issued a list of 112 """"disappeared"""" persons, of whom 56 were said to have died in detention.  In August 1999, one month after succeeding his father on the throne, Mohamed VI recognized, in very general terms, the state's responsibility in """"disappearances"""" and established an arbitration commission to compensate victims and their survivors in cases of """"disappearance"""" and prolonged arbitrary detention.   Morocco's acknowledgment of state responsibility for grave abuses of human rights and its commitment to compensate some victims are welcome initial steps towards addressing the legacy of the past.  Nevertheless, they have provoked debate and criticism, including from persons eligible for compensation who declared that they would boycott the process.  Among the criticisms is that the arbitration commission was established without any accompanying effort to investigate and reveal the truth about grave human rights violations or to identify or hold accountable their perpetrators.  To date, no official has been brought to justice for participating in the repression of the 1960s, 1970s, or 1980s.   The CCDH has given assurances that people who receive compensation have not forfeited their right to pursue remedies through other avenues, such as the courts.  Those who apply for compensation do, however, have to sign a waiver recognizing that the arbitration commission's decision on their claim is definitive and subject to no appeal.   Fearful that the government would attempt to """"close the book"""" on the abuses of the past by financially compensating a narrow category of victims, in late 1999 a group of former prisoners, victims' relatives, and human rights activists created the Forum for Truth and Justice.  That group has since been at the forefront of demands that any national reckoning of the past include establishment of an independent truth commission and a coherent approach to holding accountable those implicated in the abuses.   During 2000, the AMDH vigorously campaigned for abusers to be held accountable.  They went so far as to name several individuals whom they believed were responsible for torture or """"disappearances,"""" and urge that they be brought to justice.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/20/memorandum-us-policymakers-landmines","Memorandum for US Policymakers on Landmines","Memorandum for U.S. Policymakers on Landmines","","11/20/2001","Subject: Issues and Questions for the Landmine Policy Review It is our understanding that the U.S. is undertaking a review of current landmine policy and issues, coordinated by the National Security Council with input from the Department of Defense and Department of State. Human Rights Watch welcomes such a review, with a view toward the stated objective since 1994 of reaching a comprehensive ban on antipersonnel mines as soon as possible. Human Rights Watch strongly believes that a meaningful review must include an evaluation of current assumptions regarding the requirements for and utility of antipersonnel and antivehicle mines. An important conclusion of the recent National Academy of Sciences report on landmine alternatives was that data used to validate the effectiveness of antipersonnel mines should be updated. Current U.S. landmine policy is hinged on two conditions: the need to use antipersonnel mines to defend South Korea, and the need to retain antipersonnel mines in mixed systems to protect antitank mines. The manner in which these two issues are reviewed is the critical building block on which any landmine policy decision will be made. Human Rights Watch calls upon the Bush Administration and policy makers in the National Security Council, Department of State, and Department of Defense to consider the following issues and questions in their review of U.S. landmine policy.  Do Mines have a Role on the Modern Battlefield? According to an assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency, U.S. self-destruct antitank mines-the ones in mixed systems-may be obsolete by the end of this decade because of the proliferation of countermine systems that will be able to neutralize them. Mines have little to no utility in the war fighting principles currently being adopted by the U.S. military for the 21st century. Some outside the Pentagon have argued that mines violate the tenets of dominant maneuver, precision engagement, and focused logistics that form the foundation for the current revolution in military affairs. Smart mines were developed by the U.S. to fight Warsaw Pact armor and mechanized forces. Dumb mines are an enduring legacy of World War II and are to be used in starkly similar ways in Korea. Only cursory evaluations of the nonmaterial alternatives (i.e., changes in tactics, doctrine, or substitution of alternative sensor/weapon systems) for antipersonnel mines have been conducted by independent organizations or made public. The Pentagon probably did this in producing the Mission Needs Statements for landmine and mixed system alternatives (dated November 1997 and April 1999) but its analysis of nonmaterial alternatives has not been publicly released. The assumption that by foreswearing antipersonnel mines the U.S. would take X-percentage of higher casualties and lose Y-amount of ground, and non-use of mines would thus become a """"war stopper"""" issue must be challenged. Human Rights Watch questions the role and utility of antipersonnel mines and asks that the landmine policy review consider the following questions: Has the firepower available to frontline U.S. forces increased enough in volume and lethality to compensate for removing antipersonnel mines from calculations of final protective fires? Will weapons in development like the Objective Individual Combat Weapon (OICW) and a 120mm canister round for tank cannon change this in coming years? Is the time needed to employ mines or the minimum self-destruct times of scatterable mines compatible with the tempo of operations in the type of mobile warfare that the U.S. military is equipping and training itself to fight? Does the United States possess an adequate stock of alternative antitank weapons to destroy enemy armored forces? Are more effective and precise antitank weapons being developed or just entering service that would obviate the need for mines in the first place? Does the requirement to deliver mixed munitions reduce the availability of these alternative weapons and their delivery platforms? Have the logistical and tactical burdens of mines been calculated and considered? Has a trade-off analysis been conducted to consider the opportunity costs of not removing mines from service? Aside from the revision of Field Manual 20-32 and unpublicized changes to war plans, what changes in tactics, doctrine, and operational concepts have taken place since May 1996 to implement U.S. policy on antipersonnel mines? Are current smart mine systems compatible on the digitized battlefield? How Much Time Do Antipersonnel Mines Buy? One of the findings of a study conducted for the Pentagon in 1997 credited antipersonnel mines with providing as much as eighty minutes of delay time against dismounted forces attempting to breach a minefield containing a mix of antitank and antipersonnel mines. However, the National Academy of Sciences' panel created to examine alternative technologies to replace antipersonnel mines called into question the perception that antipersonnel mines in minefields also containing antitank mines significantly hinder a breaching operation conducted by dismounted forces using modern minefield breaching equipment. The National Academy's panel calculated that it would take ten minutes for a properly equipped enemy to breach such a minefield without fires from other weapon systems covering it. The panel even notionally doubled its estimate of breaching time to account for the """"fog of war."""" Other independent research conducted by the nongovernmental Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation has found that antipersonnel mines delay an enemy force by twenty minutes from breaching a minefield containing both antipersonnel and antitank mines, thus allowing extra air strikes on the enemy. However all of these scenarios apply only to a breach of a minefield by dismounted forces. Antipersonnel mines have little or no utility against breaching forces mounted in armored vehicles. Breaching a minefield by forces mounted in armored vehicles is the most common threat; the U.S. Army's Field Manual on Mine Warfare acknowledges this by stating that """"[b]ased on current technology, most breaching operations are accomplished by mechanical or explosive means."""" This includes North Korean forces which are equipped with a significant amount of mechanical mine clearance equipment. Human Rights Watch questions the benefit that antipersonnel mines provide in """"protecting"""" antitank mines and asks that the landmine policy review consider the following questions: In which situation do antipersonnel mines provide a greater delay effect: a dismounted breach conducted under fire or a dismounted breach conducted beyond observation or covering fires? Has it been determined which scenario U.S. forces are more likely to face? Has the delay effect of covering fires been calculated using either scenario described above? Has this been compared with the delay effect of the antipersonnel mines? Has a trade-off analysis been conducted comparing the diversion of the assets necessary for the remote delivery of an antitank and antipersonnel minefield and the employment by the same delivery systems of other weapon systems capable of killing armored vehicles? The U.S. Army is just completing procurement of nearly 190,000 M87A1 Volcano canisters containing as many as 1.14 million antivehicle mines. Previously each Volcano contained one antipersonnel mine, but a decision was made in 1996 to produce only canisters containing strictly antivehicle mines. Has a determination been made that antipersonnel mines are not necessary to protect antivehicle mines for this system? Are the M87A1 systems more vulnerable or less effective? Is There Such a Thing as a Humanitarian Mine? The United States procured a family of scatterable mines after the Vietnam conflict, which now comprises the majority of its current inventory. Nearly 86 percent of the current U.S. antipersonnel mine stockpile consists of ADAM artillery-delivered antipersonnel mines. All smart mines are designed to self-destruct between four hours to fifteen days after their use depending on the setting selected and mine type. These mines are also designed to self-deactivate within a maximum of 120 days, as their battery dies. Because of the short lifespan of these mines, some claim that these mines """"pose little, if any, humanitarian threat to noncombatants."""" What occurs between the time when the mines are armed and they self-destruct or self-deactivate is apparently not a significant consideration, even though this may be a period of hours, days, or up to seventeen weeks. Because most U.S. smart mines are remotely delivered and are not required to be marked, fenced, or monitored, they threaten civilians and livestock when used in populated areas. These mines also cannot distinguish friendly forces that may maneuver through the mined area during the course of subsequent combat operations. In recent years, senior U.S. Army combat engineers recognized the fratricide threat posed by the use of mines during exercises at combat training centers. """"This is especially true with scatterable mines,"""" states a lessons-learned document from the Army Engineer School. Taken in perfect conditions, all of these smart mines should destroy themselves and go away. However since some of the self-destruct mechanisms inevitably fail, some mines will remain intact, with no indication visible on the mine whether it is live or not. According to a U.S. Army Information Paper circulated in 1990, """"10% of all [smart mines] fail to function as planned (e.g. detonate at the wrong time, detonate immediately upon arming, fails to detonate at all, etc.)."""" The Pentagon claims that statistically, during acceptance testing, only one in ten thousand of these mines fail to self-destruct on time. The Army has also claimed that 120 days after smart mines have been activated the batteries will be sufficiently discharged so the mines will be """"self-deactivated"""" and thus will not operate as intended. However, the test protocols and results data have not been provided to substantiate this claim. There is a significant difference between acceptance testing and use in operational conditions. For example, the last time U.S. Gator mines were found and cleared in northeast Kuwait was July 8, 1993 - over two years after they were deployed. It is not known if the batteries (and therefore the fuze) were still operable because the mines were destroyed in situ; the explosive charge was still active and presented a hazard. From a deminer's perspective, all mines or unexploded ordnance must be treated as though they are live and capable of exploding. Smart mines must be cleared one at a time using the same procedures used to clear all mines. The humanitarian impact is still present whether the mines are dumb or smart. One result of this approach to distinguish between dumb and smart mines is to provide justification for many countries to keep all antipersonnel mines, whether dumb or smart. Additionally, because smart mines have a limited operational lifespan, they are not the rational choice for the long-term defense of borders, demilitarized zones, or fixed installations. This is the enduring role of the dumb mine. Therefore, since smart mines have this limitation, one naturally needs to keep dumb mines to fulfill the other role. In essence, the United States insists on this exception on the Korean Peninsula. Human Rights Watch questions the distinction between dumb and smart mines and asks that the landmine policy review consider the following questions: Can the nearly U.S.$820 million investment in alternatives to antipersonnel mines be used to purchase additional alternative weaponry capable of fulfilling the mission needs for mines? If, as some say, mines protect light early-entry forces during the early stages of a crisis, then why did U.S. forces not lay minefields during the early deployments of Operation Desert Shield? Were U.S.-delivered smart mines effective in disrupting, blocking, or canalizing enemy forces during Operation Desert Storm? Did smart mines pose a maneuver hazard to friendly forces or necessitate changes in their combat plans during Operation Desert Storm? Are all of the antipersonnel mines retained for use in Korea located within that theater? If not, when are they scheduled to arrive? Will U.S. forces use these mines to repel a North Korean invasion or are the mines designated for use in subsequent operations? In their annual testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee this year, why did not one combatant Commander in Chief highlight the need for mines as a critical combat element? Why is the U.S. considering making the only artillery-delivered scatterable antitank mine system in its inventory non-compliant with the Mine Ban Treaty by mixing it with antipersonnel mines in the RADAM system? If a decision were made to produce RADAM, would a greater number of them be needed to provide the equivalent density of antitank mines in artillery-delivered scatterable minefields? The International Context It is important that a review of landmine policy consider the international context. This includes the facts that the United States: keeps company diplomatically with Russia, China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Burma, Syria, and Cuba by refusing to join the Mine Ban Treaty; is the only NATO partner that has not signed, ratified, or initiated procedures to accede to the Mine Ban Treaty; is one of just fourteen countries that has not banned the production of antipersonnel mines; possesses the third largest stockpile of antipersonnel mines in the world, totaling more than 11 million mines, including 1.2 million """"dumb"""" mines; stockpiles 1.7 million antipersonnel mines in twelve countries, five of which are party to the Mine Ban Treaty; exported at least 5.6 million antipersonnel mines to thirty-eight countries between 1969 and 1992; manufactured antipersonnel mines that have been found in at least twenty-eight mine-affected countries or regions. Political, alliance/coalition, arms control and other global concerns should have an impact on decision-making regarding antipersonnel mines. There can be many advantages to the U.S. politically and militarily from being part of the international ban on antipersonnel mines as soon as possible. There will be a tangible increase in U.S. security from a global mine ban. Another factor that needs to be weighed is the impact of mines, often of U.S. origin, on U.S. forces. Mines have caused nearly 100,000 U.S. Army casualties since 1942. One-third of all U.S. Army casualties in Vietnam were the result of mine incidents; the enemy emplaced most of these mines. Of the seventy-five U.S. Army personnel killed in action by known enemy munitions in the Persian Gulf War, twenty-nine were the result of mines. Of the fifty-six U.S. Army personnel wounded in action by known enemy munitions, fourteen were the result of mines. Peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Bosnia, and Kosovo have all resulted in U.S. mine casualties. At least two U.S. service members were wounded by antipersonnel mines in 2001, one in Kosovo and one in South Korea.","United States","Arms, Landmines"

The level of mortality among young and productive adults in Africa and in countries around the world that are affected by HIV/AIDS is unprecedented in history. It is, by any reckoning, a humanitarian crisis demanding urgent action and strong political leadership. The deprivation of life caused by HIV/AIDS, including eighteen million deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, is not equally or randomly distributed in the world. HIV/AIDS can be managed medically and can be prevented through well supported government action even where widespread poverty exists, as the governments of Brazil and Uganda, for example, have so well demonstrated.  Across the world, persons infected and affected by HIV/AIDS have lost their basic rights and freedoms in addition to their right to life. Persons living with HIV/AIDS who have been courageous enough to speak out about their disease have been subjected to violence, abuse, stigmatization, marginalization and discrimination in employment and access to services. HIV-positive persons in your country have suffered all of these human rights violations.  The constitution of South Africa is a model statement of commitment to human rights for all of Africa and the world. Your own commitment to these ideals has been demonstrated in many other fields. But that commitment is belied by a policy of denial and neglect of the profound crisis of HIV/AIDS in South Africa.  The position of the government of the Republic of South Africa has gone beyond the inaction that has unfortunately characterized government response to HIV/AIDS in so many countries. Much more deadly is your government's active undermining of a rational and effective response to the crisis through systematic denial of extremely well demonstrated science on the causation of the epidemic and refusal to take advantage of any opportunities to make HIV/AIDS treatment available to your population. While widespread poverty in South Africa is undoubtedly a significant factor in worsening the effects of HIV transmission, this does not mean that countering the epidemic must rely on what can only be long term efforts to improve the standard of living of the poor. Treatment programs for HIV/AIDS themselves can help to reduce poverty, by enabling the poor to continue working and thus maintain an income.  In April this year, South Africa won a potentially significant victory for health and human rights, when the predatory lawsuit of thirty-nine pharmaceutical companies against your government was dropped. A golden opportunity was created to mount a large-scale publicly funded program of treatment for HIV/AIDS and the opportunistic infections associated with it. It is a source of great discouragement to everyone interested in protecting the rights of persons affected by HIV/AIDS to see that, nevertheless, non-governmental organizations have had to force the South African state into court to try to win access to basic programs of prevention and treatment. The continued refusal of your government to pursue such a program - even to support the provision of the low-cost treatment for prevention of mother-to-child transmission - along with public statements that sow confusion about the scientific basis for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment programs, are acts of injustice against your people.  When governments do little or nothing to facilitate prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS, when treatment is feasible, they are themselves guilty of the arbitrary deprivation of life that is prohibited by article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and by chapter 2 of the constitution of the Republic of South Africa. In South Africa, moreover, the focus on treatment alone caused by the government's refusal to accept the use of antiretroviral drugs has diverted attention from the equally important task of taking steps to end the violence, abuse, and discrimination suffered by those infected or at high risk of infection with HIV/AIDS.  We urge you urgently to take the following measures: End the mother-to-child-transmission court case against the government by committing to programs to prevent vertical transmission of HIV in all government health facilities that offer antenatal care.  Authorize the appropriate actors in your government to work with the medical and public health communities and non-governmental organizations to use the considerable infrastructure of your government's health system to bring treatment, including antiretroviral drugs where necessary, to the millions of persons infected by HIV/AIDS. Increase the government's allocation of funds to combat HIV/AIDS to a sum commensurate with the scale of the problem, rather than the less than one percent of the national and provincial budgets currently devoted to the crisis, and encourage support from international donors for programs to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Support the efforts of individuals and organizations in the scientific, medical and public health sectors and in non-governmental organizations who are working to mount an effective evidence-based response to HIV/AIDS in South Africa.Your leadership in the fight against HIV/AIDS, as in other aspects of the struggle for freedom and human rights in South Africa and in Africa as a whole, is essential to prevent an even greater catastrophe for South Africa resulting from this disease.

The South African government is currently in court fighting a case brought by the Treatment Action Campaign of South Africa to ensure HIV-positive women have access to affordable antiretroviral treatment to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV to their newborns. A hearing in the case is scheduled for November 26 in the Pretoria High Court. President Mbeki has at various times denied that the human immunodeficiency virus is the cause of AIDS and has alleged dangers of anti-AIDS drugs that are unproven in clinical science.  “Mbeki should pull the government out of this case and support programs to help newborns start life free of HIV,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa Division. “Even in much lower-income African countries, women increasingly have access to this treatment.”  South Africa has the largest number of persons living with HIV/AIDS of any country, about 4.2 million, according to United Nations figures. The Medical Research Council of South Africa recently estimated that 7 million persons could die of HIV/AIDS by 2010, mostly young adults in their prime. Although South Africa has resources to provide treatment to a significant number of AIDS sufferers, the government has consistently resisted supporting treatment programs.  In April 2001, South Africa won a victory against 39 pharmaceutical companies that had sued the government because of the provisions of a 1997 law that would have facilitated the production and importation of generic drugs for HIV/AIDS. The opportunity for treatment programs that was created when the companies dropped their suit in the face of national and international pressure has been left unused by the government, which does not fund treatment programs on a significant level.  “President Mbeki could go a long way to redeeming his mishandling of AIDS by supporting the treatment for mother-to-child transmission,” said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch urged President Mbeki to lead the government in increasing budgetary support for HIV/AIDS programs – currently allocated less than 1 percent of the national budget – and in working with the medical and public health leaders in South Africa who are already mobilized to strengthen both prevention and treatment programs.  “President Mbeki’s questioning of the science of HIV/AIDS and the South African government’s active refusal to support programs of known effectiveness is helping to fuel the AIDS crisis in South Africa,” said Takirambudde. “This is much worse than the government inaction we have seen so often regarding HIV/AIDS.”","Africa, South Africa","Health, Women's Rights, Health Care Access"

As a result of a resolution adopted today by the General Assembly's Sixth Committee, negotiations on the Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism will recommence at the end of January. Human Rights Watch warned that portions of the treaty, as now drafted, undermine refugee protections, freedom of expression, and the laws of war.  """"In the rush to take action against terrorism, governments must be careful not to trample on human rights,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program. """"There's time to fix what is wrong with this treaty.""""  International refugee law already prevents individuals who have committed terrorist acts or other serious crimes from benefiting from refugee protection, Dicker said, and the tighter restrictions on refugees in the draft treaty could keep innocent refugees and asylum-seekers from gaining protection.  The draft text could also greatly restrict freedom of expression by treating a journalist who supports a political objective as a potential terrorist. Finally, the treaty could undercut the laws of war by criminalizing acts committed in an internal armed conflict that are not prohibited by humanitarian law.  Although negotiations on this treaty had been underway for several years, pressure to complete the text intensified in the wake of the September 11 attacks. However, negotiations stalled at the end of a two-week session on October 26, in large part because of an effort to exempt individuals struggling against """"foreign occupation"""" from consideration as terrorists.  After the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373 on September 28 and the General Assembly held its Plenary Debate on terrorism in early October, Secretary-General Kofi Annan tried to bring the opposing sides together. The Secretary-General convened several meetings with key ambassadors in early November. During last week's General Debate, high-level discussions with foreign ministers continued, but no agreement was reached.","Global","United Nations, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

As you know, the United Nations panel of experts on Liberia, which investigated violations of arms, diamond, and travel sanctions imposed in Security Council Resolution 1343 (2001), recently documented numerous arms shipments to Liberia within the past eighteen months. These weapons shipments were in flagrant violation of the arms embargo imposed on Liberia in 1992 (Resolution 788) and tightened earlier this year.   We understand that earlier this month the Security Council asked the Liberia sanctions committee to review the recommendations of the Liberia panel and forward a report to the Council for consideration. We realize that the next scheduled review of the arms embargo on Liberia will not take place until May 2002, but feel strongly that to defer strengthening of enforcement measures of the existing embargo until then would be a serious mistake. A number of steps can and should be taken now to give the existing arms embargo teeth.   A great deal is at stake. The continued flouting of the arms embargo poses grave risks to security and human rights in Liberia, as well as in Sierra Leone and Guinea. Positive developments in the sub-region, including progress toward disarmament in Sierra Leone, would be undermined by the further influx of arms to Liberia. The conflicts in the Mano River Union countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea) are intertwined and mutually reinforcing, and new weapons inflows could readily set alight this tinderbox region.   Please find attached a briefing paper we prepared for your consideration. It offers an analysis of the sanctions-busting trade in Liberia and includes a number of recommendations for immediate Security Council action. We have highlighted in particular the role of arms-exporting countries, whose lax controls make possible the illicit trafficking in weapons. Much can be done in the short term to improve and enforce the arms embargo. We hope that you will seriously consider adopting such needed measures, and doing so in advance of the embargo review scheduled for May 2002.   Thank you for your kind consideration.

Human Rights Watch also urged foreign fighters with the Taliban to respect the laws of war. In Kunduz, detailed and credible reports have emerged that foreign fighters have begun summarily executing local Taliban fighters who were considering surrendering to the Northern Alliance.  Following their retreat from the northern city of Mazar-i Sharif, thousands of Taliban fighters have been surrounded by the Northern Alliance in Kunduz, the only northern city remaining under Taliban control. According to numerous sources, a significant number of foreigners who fought with the Taliban-identified by various sources as Pakistanis, Arabs, Chechens, Central Asians, and Chinese fighters-are also surrounded in Kunduz.  """"If the Northern Alliance kills any fighters without accepting their offer of surrender, that's a war crime,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Northern Alliance must respect the laws of war for foreign fighters in Kunduz, no less than Afghani ones.""""  Since surrounding the Taliban and their foreign allies in Kunduz, senior Northern Alliance leaders, while encouraging the surrender of Afghan Taliban troops, have repeatedly stated that they will not accept surrender offers from the foreign fighters, preferring to kill them instead. Pir Muhammed, a senior Northern Alliance commander, told the New York Times: """"These foreigners have killed thousands of civilians. Their hands are covered with blood. We will avenge this."""" A second senior Northern Alliance commander, General Daoud Khan, told the Associated Press: """"For the foreign terrorists… there will be no negotiations, we will not deal with them, they are killers.""""  The laws of war explicitly outlaw orders refusing to accept the surrender of an adversary, a practice known as """"giving no quarter."""" Article 40 of Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which reflects customary international law applicable to the current conflict in Afghanistan, states: """"It is prohibited to order that there shall be no survivors, to threaten an adversary therewith or to conduct hostilities on this basis."""" The authoritative commentary of the International Committee of the Red Cross makes clear that this article also protects foreign fighters such as those involved in Kunduz:  """"[A]ny order of 'liquidation' is prohibited, whether it concerns commandos, political or any other kind of commissars, irregular troops or so-called irregular troops, saboteurs, parachutists, mercenaries or persons considered to be mercenaries, or other cases. It is not only the order to put them to death that is prohibited, but also the threat and the execution, with or without orders.""""  """"The law is absolutely clear on this point,"""" said Jones. """"The Northern Alliance can fight the Taliban if they refuse to surrender, or arrest them for crimes they may have committed if they do surrender. But the Northern Alliance cannot refuse to accept an offer of surrender by the foreign fighters if such an offer is made.""""  Human Rights Watch is also deeply concerned by credible reports of large-scale summary executions of would-be Taliban defectors by foreign fighters in the city of Kunduz. Such executions, if confirmed, are clearly crimes prohibited by international law. """"The way to stop war crimes in Afghanistan now is to start talking about future prosecution of the guilty,"""" said Jones.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/20/indian-parliament-debates-anti-terrorism-legislation","Indian Parliament Debates Anti-Terrorism Legislation","Indian Parliament Debates Anti-Terrorism Legislation","","11/20/2001","The Indian parliament is currently debating the enactment of legislation that would reinstate a modified version of the Terrorists and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) of 1985 (amended 1987).  TADA led to tens of thousands of politically motivated detentions, torture, and other human rights violations. In the face of mounting opposition to the act, India’s government acknowledged these abuses and consequently let TADA lapse in 1995. But in response to national security concerns, and as relations with Pakistan deteriorate and violence in Kashmir and elsewhere escalates, the Indian government has introduced the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO).  On October 24, by means of an emergency constitutional provision, President K.R. Narayanan signed the ordinance into law.  To remain in effect it needs to be approved during the current session of parliament where it will likely face considerable resistance by opposition parties.  The session began on November 19. The Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance sets forth a broad definition of terrorism that includes acts of violence or disruption of essential services carried out with """"intent to threaten the unity and integrity of India or to strike terror in any part of the people."""" It also extends existing law by making it a crime not to provide authorities with """"information relating to any terrorist activity."""" The government used TADA as a tool to fight trade unions and to detain Muslims, Sikhs, Dalits, and political opponents. Over 76,000 people were arrested while TADA was in force from 1987 to 1995.  The conviction rate for these arrests was less than one percent.  If enacted, the POTO threatens to be put to similar misuse. On its face, POTO violates a multitude of due process rights guaranteed both by the Indian Constitution and international human rights treaties—most prominently, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). India ratified the ICCPR in 1979.  Moreover, contrary to government rhetoric suggesting that POTO contains safeguards to prevent the abuses enabled by TADA, POTO will likewise facilitate illegal detentions. Safeguards added to POTO but not included in TADA include immediate notification of family members following arrest and restrictions on the use of confessions extracted by torture, but it is more stringent than a criminal law bill that had been in the works to replace TADA. In putting forward the new proposal, the Indian cabinet rejected the pending criminal law bill, deeming it """"too weak to provide a legal framework for combating terrorism.""""  What follows is an overview of some of the problematic provisions of POTO and the rights that are likely to be violated under the legal regime it helps to establish.  It is by no means an exhaustive list.  Section 4 of POTO mimics Section 5 of TADA in setting out a legal presumption that if a person is found in unauthorized possession of arms in a “notified area,” he or she is automatically linked with terrorist activity.  This and other provisions undermine one’s right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Section 3 (3) makes punishable the act of abetting a terrorist but does not spell out the requisite intent. Certain provisions of POTO are even more draconian than those operational under TADA, particularly those seeking to curb the right to information and freedom of expression.  Section 3 (8) of POTO, for example, punishes those in possession of information of material assistance in preventing a “terrorist act.”  Failure to provide such information is punishable by up to three years imprisonment.  Section 14 empowers investigating officers to extract information from individuals whom they suspect of having such information.  Journalists and media organizations throughout the country have criticized these provisions arguing that it places upon them a burden to disclose any information gathered in the course of their investigations. TADA allowed for people to be detained in police custody for up to six months without charge or trial.  While POTO limits this period to three months, the potential for abuse and arbitrary detention is just as high.  POTO also lacks any provision to challenge the sufficiency of evidence cited by the prosecution for trial.  As with TADA, detainees are therefore likely to languish in prison without any evidence or formal charges being brought against them.  In fact, detention of persons under TADA continues to this day for offenses allegedly committed before the law lapsed—a practice that authorities reportedly abuse through the spurious backdating of violations. Those newly detained join thousands of others who continue to be held under a provision authorizing their continued detention, even though the law itself is no longer in force.  POTO has been strongly criticized by leading civil rights groups—including the People’s Union for Civil Liberties—academics, lawyers, opposition parties, media organizations, and both religious and secular institutions. Finally, the National Human Rights Commission, which opposed the now defunct Criminal Law Amendment Bill, has yet to see a copy of the Ordinance.  The Commission also maintains that existing laws are sufficient to fight the threat of terrorism. In light of the problems outlined above we recommend that you:  Urge the government of India to repeal this ill-considered legislation.   Any government’s fight against terrorism must be accompanied by checks on law enforcement agencies in order to guarantee basic rights to life, personal liberty, and due process.  To that end we recommend that you urge the Indian government to:  Establish a civilian review board or civilian ombudsman committee comprising judges and lawyers to monitor police stations and ensure that 1996 Supreme Court guidelines on treatment of persons in custody, as established in D. K. Basu v. State of West Bengal, are strictly enforced. NGO input should also be solicited.  The review board should ensure that complaints against law enforcement personnel are promptly and thoroughly investigated by adequately trained investigatory staff. The agency should have the power to subpoena documents, summon witnesses, and enter the premises of police stations, lock-ups, and detention centers to conduct thorough investigations. Implement the recommendations made by the National Police Commission in 1980, specifically those that call for a mandatory judicial inquiry in cases of alleged rape, death, or grievous injury of people in police custody and for the establishment of investigative bodies whose members should include civilians as well as police and judicial authorities.  Another bill up for consideration during the parliament’s winter session seeks to empower the government to suspend the passport or travel documents of any citizen suspected to be a terrorist.  The ordinance, signed by President K. R. Narayanan, came into force on October 23 and amends the Indian Passport Act of 1967.  The legislation empowers both central and state governments to suspend the passport and travel documents of any suspected terrorist, subversive, militant or anti-national element or any person suspected of having links with such organizations. Many human rights activists, including Dalit activists who recently participated in the World Conference Against Racism, have been labeled as “anti-national elements” for publicizing internationally issues that the government would rather keep hidden. We are concerned that this legislation would be used to restrict the travel of these and other activists and urge you to recommend its repeal. Threats to Freedom of Expression Since the beginning of U.S.-led air strikes in Afghanistan on October 7, the Indian government has clamped down on peaceful demonstrators protesting the strikes, labeling them “anti-national elements” as well.  On October 7, for example, six Delhi University students were arrested for distributing pamphlets while protesting against the U.S.-led air strikes on Afghanistan.  Organizations protesting India’s backing of the U.S.-led campaign have also faced increasing harassment from the police.  We ask that you:  Urge the Indian government to ensure that the rights to freedom of expression and assembly are respected at all times.   Police Violence On October 28 seven anti-U.S. protestors were killed when police opened fire on a demonstration against U.S. air strikes.  In the town of Malegaon in the western state of Maharashtra local police tried to prevent a small group of Muslims from distributing leaflets calling on people to boycott U.S.-made goods and to oppose air strikes in Afghanistan.  According to officials, the protestors began throwing stones at the police who then baton-charged the crowds.  Feeling outnumbered, the police then began shooting.  Three more people were killed the following night when protestors tried to block the main road connecting Malegaon to the capital Delhi.  Police say they used baton charges and tear gas to disperse the crowd but when that failed, they fired at the protestors.   We urge you to:  Call on the Indian government to investigate the circumstances of these killings and, if appropriate, to pursue prosecution of police officers and others who violated the law.   Hindu Nationalism and Religious Intolerance The assertion of Hindu nationalism has posed new challenges to India’s constitutional commitment to secular democracy.  The policies espoused by India’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its sister organizations, collectively known as the sangh parivar, have already resulted in much violence against the country’s minority populations.  We urge you ask Indian government to take immediate steps to reverse this dangerous trend. The past three years have witnessed an alarming rise in attacks against Christians across the country, including the killing of priests, raping of nuns, and the destruction of Christian institutions, schools, churches, colleges, and cemeteries.  In addition, right-wing Hindu organizations have also engaged in violence against India’s Muslim and non‑Christian Dalit communities.  In most cases, those responsible for the attacks have yet to be prosecuted. In Gujarat, Delhi, and Orissa, district administrations continue to conduct surveys to assess the activities and whereabouts of minority community members and leaders. The BJP and its allies continue to implement their agenda for the """"Hinduization"""" of education with the mandating of Hindu prayers in state-sponsored schools and the revision of history books to include what amounts to hate propaganda against Islamic and Christian communities.  Throughout the country, over 300,000 training camps, known as shakhas, are dedicated to recruiting young boys and men and providing them with extensive physical and ideological training for the purpose of creating a group of volunteers full of """"Hindu fervor"""" with military-like discipline. In the hopes of achieving a comeback victory in elections in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh scheduled for early next year, the BJP and its allies have amplified calls to build a temple to the Hindu god Ram at the site of the Babri Masjid, a mosque in the city of Ayodhya in Uttar Pradesh.  The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), along with the other organizations with strong links to the BJP, claimed that the site of the mosque was actually the birthplace of Ram and that a temple at that site had been destroyed in order to build the mosque. On December 6, 1992, the mosque was demolished by members of the VHP, the Bajrang Dal, and Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh-trained cadres. The police did not intervene. The incident sparked violence around the country in which thousands were killed, most notably Muslims in the city of Bombay.  In an atmosphere of heightened communal tensions, many fear that the Ram temple campaign could lead to more violence and bloodshed between the state’s Hindu and Muslim communities. These are but a few examples of the growing and extremely harmful influence of Hindu extremism on India civil society. Domestically, many have joined in protesting such trends, but in the absence of international attention, India's celebrated traditions as a pluralistic and secular democracy will continue to suffer. We recommend that you urge the Indian government to:  Provide adequate police protection to minority communities in violence‑affected areas, including, where necessary, an increase in the number of police stations and outposts in each district. Require that police register all cases of communal attacks, regardless of the religious background of the complainant. End impunity for past campaigns of violence against minorities.  Prosecute and punish all those found responsible for murder, rape, assault, and destruction of property during the post-Ayodhya violence of December 1992 and January 1993. Launch a nationwide public awareness campaign regarding the dangers of communal violence and refrain from exploiting communal tensions for political ends.      Kashmir Human rights and international humanitarian law violations by all parties in Kashmir have been a critical factor behind the escalation of fighting there. The situation will continue to deteriorate unless India ends widespread human rights violations by its security forces in Kashmir, and Pakistan ends its support for abusive militant groups.  We urge you to:  Encourage the Indian government to ensure that all reports of extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" deaths in custody, torture, and rape by security forces and unofficial paramilitary forces in Kashmir are promptly investigated and prosecuted. Urge the government of Pakistan to end all support for abusive militant organizations in Kashmir and cease providing indiscriminate weapons, such as landmines, to such groups.  Caste Discrimination Dalits throughout India, some 160 million people, are denied their basic civil rights because of their ranks as """"untouchables"""" at the bottom of India's caste system.  Dalits are discriminated against, denied access to land, forced to work in degrading conditions, and routinely abused at the hands of the police and of higher-caste groups that enjoy the state's protection.  In what has been called India's """"hidden apartheid,"""" entire villages in many Indian states remain completely segregated by caste. In its annual Human Rights Report the European Parliament called upon the E.U. to investigate the extent to which its policies “contribute to the abolition of caste discrimination and the practice of untouchability in India” and “to formulate strategies to counter the widespread practice [of caste discrimination].”  It also called upon the E.U. and its member states to ensure that caste discrimination was included in the final declaration of the World Conference Against Racism.  A subsequent parliamentary resolution expressed regret that the final declaration failed to highlight caste discrimination.  This despite the fact that a parallel meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Durban included reference to discrimination on the basis of work and descent, or caste, in its final declaration. We ask that you urge the Indian government to seek international cooperation and assistance in tackling the very immense and important task of combating caste-based violence and discrimination.  In particular, we hope that you will urge that government to take the following steps:  Implement measures designed to ensure that states abolish the practice of “untouchability,” in compliance with Article 17 of India’s constitution. Ensure strict implementation of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, including the establishment of special courts and special prosecutors in each revenue district. Invite the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to visit India.","Asia, India","Terrorism / Counterterrorism"

Convicted of """"debauchery"""" on September 18 after police coerced him into giving a confession, the boy received a sentence of three years' imprisonment with labor followed by three years of probation. His appeal, originally set for October 31, will be heard on November 21.  Human Rights Watch called on Egypt's prosecutor general to ask the appeals court to overturn the conviction, citing discriminatory application of the law, charges of torture during interrogation, prolonged pretrial detention, limited access to counsel and family members, and a failure to protect the boy's privacy during the court proceedings.  """"This case has been marred by a host of human rights violations,"""" said Clarisa Bencomo of the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It should never have come to trial.""""  The youth has said that police extracted a confession from him after subjecting him to painful beating on the soles of the feet. He did not have access to a lawyer during his interrogation, and he was not allowed to contact his family during the first two weeks of his detention. Press and spectators were allowed to attend and report on the September and October hearings, and the boy's name, photo, and accounts of the charges and sentence have appeared in Egypt's semi-official press.  The boy was one of fifty-six people detained and charged with similar offenses after a crackdown in May against men presumed to be gay. The others, all adults, were prosecuted separately before an Emergency State Security Court, which reached a verdict on November 14. Twenty-three were sentenced to between one and five years of hard labor; twenty-nine were acquitted.  Last week, Egyptian authorities made four additional arrests of men presumed to be gay, according to reports in the Egyptian press.  Egypt does not expressly outlaw homosexual acts. Instead, authorities initially accused the boy of """"abuse of religion"""" (istighlal al din). Interrogated before he was allowed to contact a lawyer, the boy denied the initial accusation but admitted to engaging in sexual acts with men, leading prosecutors to charge him with debauchery (mumarasat al fujur). Three years' imprisonment followed by a similar period of probation is the maximum sentence that can be imposed under this provision, contained in Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of Prostitution.  """"Egyptian authorities targeted these individuals solely because of their presumed sexual orientation,"""" Bencomo said. """"By discriminating against a group of its citizens in this way, Egypt has violated a fundamental principle of human rights law.""""  In addition, criminalization is not an appropriate response to sexual activity on the part of a child, Human Rights Watch argued. International law does not permit the criminalization of sexual relations between consenting adults of the same sex; a child should not be held criminally responsible for an act that would not, under these standards, be subject to criminal responsibility if committed by an adult.  The arrests and convictions also take place in a climate of serious erosion of basic civil rights for Egyptian citizens. The country has been under continuous emergency rule since October 1981, following the assassination of Anwar Sadat. Following a resurgence of political violence in the early 1990s, the government introduced antiterror laws that gave the security and intelligence services greater powers of arrest and detention, enabling them to round up thousands of suspects.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","Children's Rights, LGBT Rights, Youth Justice"

By abrogating the long-established confidentiality of attorney-client communications, the new rule directly infringes the right to counsel guaranteed under international human rights law and the U.S. Constitution. Attorney-client communications should only be monitored upon a court order based on probable cause that the communications fall within the well-established """"crime-fraud"""" exception to the attorney-client privilege.  The new rule permits the government to monitor attorney-client conversations or written materials when the Attorney General has """"reasonable suspicion"""" the inmate may use communications with attorneys to """"further or facilitate"""" acts of terrorism. The monitoring may be undertaken to the extent """"reasonably necessary for the purpose of deterring future acts of violence or terrorism.""""  It has long been recognized that effective exercise of the right to counsel requires the ability to communicate in private with one's attorneys. Full and candid communication between attorneys and their clients promotes the rule of law and the administration of justice. Government interference with or intrusions into attorney-client communications are consequently permitted only in extremely narrow and judicially-scrutinized cases. The new Department of Justice rule obliterates the confidentiality of attorney-client communications, however, for a new broad and vaguely defined category of people - those who are suspected of using conversations or writings with their attorneys to further terrorism.   The Department of Justice suggests the new rule is not an impermissible violation of he right to counsel because 1) persons in custody would be notified of the monitoring before its initiations, and 2) because there would be a """"firewall"""" between the monitors of the communications and other investigators or prosecutors. Except where acts of violence are imminent, federal court approval would be required before any information obtained through the monitoring would be disclosed. Neither of these measures, however, undoes the harm caused by government surveillance of attorney-client communications. Persons in custody cannot be expected to communicate freely with their attorneys about the facts and circumstances surrounding their cases if agents of the government that put them in custody are listening in. Whether or not the information obtained from the monitoring is ever used in a criminal case, the inmate has been deprived of his or her right to maintain legal communications free from the inquiring gaze of the government.   U.S. law has long recognized that attorney-client privilege of confidentiality does not protect for communications in furtherance of future illegal conduct - the so-called """"crime-fraud"""" exception to the privilege. The decision that those communications are not protected, however, must be made by the courts on a case-by-case basis - not by the very government that has detained and may seek to prosecute the individuals being monitored.   The unilateral decision of the Department of Justice to ignore the attorney-client privilege for certain detainees or inmates suggests a troubling indifference to the importance of safeguarding basic rights and liberties. We call on Congress to ensure that the U.S. campaign against terrorism does not entail a progressive dismantling of the very rights that have long been a hallmark of the country. We urge you to press the Department of Justice to revoke the rule or at least to modify it so that no monitoring may be undertaken except pursuant to a judicial order.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/16/cluster-bomblets-litter-afghanistan","Cluster Bomblets Litter Afghanistan","Cluster Bomblets Litter Afghanistan","","11/16/2001","(New York) -- Nearly 5,000 unexploded and highly volatile cluster bomblets may be littered across areas of Afghanistan that were targeted by U.S. warplanes, Human Rights Watch said today. """"These unexploded bomblets have in effect become antipersonnel landmines,"""" said Mark Hiznay, senior researcher of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"They pose an extreme hazard to civilians, not just now but for years to come."""" Human Rights Watch repeated its calls for the United States to immediately stop using cluster bombs in Afghanistan.  Human Rights Watch learned from U.S. military sources that as of last Thursday, November 8, 2001, the U.S. had used 350 cluster bombs in the air campaign in Afghanistan. Of these, 150 were the CBU-87 Combined Effects Munition; the remaining 200 were the CBU-103, a recent variant of the CBU-87 with the Wind Corrected Munitions Dispenser kit added to make it more accurate. Each CBU-87 and CBU-103 releases 202 BLU-97 bomblets over a wide area, dimensions of which are dependent on several factors such as release altitude, spin rate of the munition, and wind speed.  This means that 70,700 BLU-97 bomblets have been dispersed from these 350 cluster bombs. The BLU-97 bomblets have a high initial failure rate, meaning an unacceptably large proportion fail to explode on contact as designed. These unexploded duds remain highly unstable, capable of exploding on the slightest disturbance or contact. They become, in effect, antipersonnel landmines. BLU-97 duds have led to high casualty rates in Iraq and Yugoslavia following the conflicts there.  Using a 7 percent initial failure rate for the BLU-97 bomblet, an estimated 4,949 hazardous duds may now be littering areas in Afghanistan where these cluster munitions have been dropped. Historically, the failure rate of submunitions can range from 5 to 30 percent depending on the type of munition used and other operational and environmental conditions. Human Rights Watch obtained the 7 percent failure rate for BLU-97 bomblets from statistical reports by the United Nations Mine Action Coordination Center in Kosovo on unexploded ordnance and mine clearance operations in Kosovo since June 1999.  Human Rights Watch believes that the fluid situation in Afghanistan now, more than ever, dictates that coalition air forces immediately discontinue use of cluster munitions. Un-uniformed combatants, civilian refugees, and relief personnel are intermingled and some or all of them may be using similar, sometimes commandeered, vehicles. The use of area weapons such as cluster bombs is clearly inappropriate in this situation because any military advantage gained by their use is outweighed by the risks to the civilian population.  The unexploded BLU-97 bomblets are yellow soda-can-size objects. The U.S. Defense Department, acknowledging on November 1, 2001 the tragic possibilities of confusing these objects with similarly colored food packets, began dropping leaflets warning the civilian population of the danger and also announced it would change the color of the food packets.  Human Rights Watch welcomes the step of changing the color of the food packets and the efforts to warn the population, but stresses that it hardly solves the enduring problem of unexploded dud cluster bomblets.  The United Nations office in Islamabad has so far publicly confirmed one civilian death and three civilian injuries (including two children) from handling unexploded cluster bomb duds in the villages of Eshaq Sulaiman Zai and Shakar Qala. The manager for the U.N. Mine Action Program for Afghanistan at a November 9, 2001 news conference also stated the coalition force is being cooperative and is providing some information on locations of strikes, which may contain unexploded ordnance.  """"The United States will have a special responsibility to clean up the unexploded submunitions and other unexploded ordnance once the fighting stops,"""" Hiznay said. """"The U.S. should make available the necessary information and resources so that this can be done promptly and safely."""" NATO eventually provided to the U.N. Mine Action Coordination Center in Kosovo a database of all of the locations where they knew cluster bombs had been used.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan","Arms, Cluster Munitions"

The Taliban regime succeeded in virtually erasing women from public life. Afghan women were denied rights to education, movement, dress, health care and association. With Taliban-held cities falling to the Northern Alliance every day, the international community's discussions of a post-Taliban government are taking on great urgency. So far, those discussions have been devoid of any serious mention of how to include women in discussions about the future governance of Afghanistan, and how to guarantee that any future government is willing to promote women's fundamental right to equality and dignity.   The demise of the Taliban should be good news for the women of Afghanistan, but without vigilance and commitment by the United Nations and the international community Afghan women will have negligible say in the formation of a new government. As a result, after the war, they could end up only marginally better off than they were under Taliban rule. The UN special envoy to Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and Secretary of State Colin Powell are working to put together a """"broad- based, diverse, representative and multiethnic coalition"""" to decide Afghanistan's political future. Or are they? Women's rights activists from around the world and Afghan women themselves are concerned that Afghan women will once again be excluded from any future coalition.     Afghan women suffered systematic violence and discrimination during the war between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance. The Taliban used draconian and arbitrary rules and public beatings to control and terrorize women. But the extent of the Northern Alliance's commitment to women's equality is unclear and untested.   Both the alliance and the Taliban raped women during the conflict. Thousands of women have been physically assaulted by both factions and have had severe restrictions placed on their liberty and basic freedoms.   Now General Powell and Mr. Brahimi seem on the brink of leaving women out of the discussions about Afghanistan's future.   Mr. Brahimi has had discussions with Afghan women's groups in Pakistan and the United States, but Afghan women are not convinced of his commitment to ensure women's inclusion. One Afghan women's activist told me that Mr. Brahimi believes it is just too difficult to involve women in this process.   The United States and the United Nations must consider including women in at least two key ways if their commitment to women's rights is to be anything other than rhetoric.   First, they should consult with women in civil society about their views and criteria for a government in Afghanistan. Second, they should include women at the negotiation table as equal participants in determining Afghanistan's political future.   Bringing women into this process is the only way to increase the likelihood of a post-Taliban government in Afghanistan that respects their rights.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/16/concerning-measures-anti-terrorism-crime-and-security-bill","Concerning Measures in Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Bill","Concerning Measures in Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill","","11/16/2001","Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned that the measures included in the “Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill” (the bill) introduced by the Home Office on November 13 contravene fundamental European and international human rights guarantees. While we understand the need to enhance internal security in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks in the United States and in the context of on-going armed conflict in Afghanistan, we are dismayed by U.K. proposals that would permit the arbitrary detention of persons suspected of terrorist activity, as well as the denial of the right to seek asylum, the exclusion, and indefinite detention of certain individuals without adequate safeguards contrary to the 1951 Refugee Convention. Public statements by the Home Secretary suggest that a public emergency was declared in the U.K. to avoid compliance with certain human rights obligations—threatening basic rights in the U.K. and providing a dangerous model for other states. Definition of Terrorism Clause 21 of the bill would task the Home Secretary with certifying a “suspected international terrorist.” The Home Secretary may certify a """"suspected international terrorist"""" if he believes that the person’s presence in the U.K. is a risk to national security and he suspects that the person is an international terrorist. The definition of a “suspected international terrorist” is vague and over-inclusive. Of particular concern is clause 21(2)(c), which states that a person is a suspected international terrorist if he or she “has links with a person who is a member of or belongs to an international terrorist group.” A “link” with a member of a terrorist group is too tenuous a relationship to signify that a person has been involved in the commission of terrorist activities. Broad, undefined terms such as “links” could result in findings of “guilt by association” for persons sharing the same political ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social grouping or even family with persons who commit acts of terrorism. Extended Immigration Detention Clauses 22 and 23 of the proposed law deal with problems related to removal or deportation of a suspected terrorist. Clause 23 would permit the indefinite detention of foreign nationals suspected of terrorism-related activities who cannot be returned to their own country or to a different country because of practical problems related, for example, to securing proper documentation or because they might be subject to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).[1] The bill would require that such persons be detained as national security threats and released only when they no longer pose such a risk or at such time when a country agrees to accept them and protect them from Article 3 violations.[2] Appeals to the Home Secretary’s certification of a person as a suspected terrorist would have to be made to the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) within three months of the certification.[3] The SIAC could cancel a certificate if it disagreed with the Home Secretary’s belief or suspicion, or it could dismiss an appeal if it found in favor of the Home Secretary. The SIAC would also be tasked with reviewing each certificate every six months to determine if the person is still a national security threat and thus subject to the certification. Appeals against a decision by SIAC regarding the initial certification and on-going review of certification could be lodged only on points of law to the Court of Appeal. It is well-established in European and international law that detention without adequate recourse to effective judicial review by a court or other quasi-judicial body is a violation of fundamental human rights guarantees. The bill’s detention provision would violate Article 5 of the ECHR, which guarantees the right to liberty and security of person.[4] Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), provides key procedural guarantees to ensure that no person is detained arbitrarily.[5] Indefinite detention has been determined to be a form of arbitrary detention in violation of these treaties. It is important to note that the prohibition against arbitrary detention has risen to the level of customary law, meaning it is such a fundamental and widely accepted principle that even states that have not ratified regional or international human rights instruments are obliged to observe the prohibition. The United Nations Human Rights Committee, established to monitor compliance with the ICCPR, has determined that Article 9 applies to immigration control measures and other cases where public security is at issue.[6] Although the proposed bill provides for oversight of the certification and on-going detention of a person suspected of terrorist activity, the U.K. courts have already substantially limited the authority of the SIAC to overrule Home Secretary decisions in terrorist cases. In a May 2000 decision, the Court of Appeal rejected a decision by the SIAC in the case of Shafiq Ur Rehman, a Pakistani national subject to deportation on order of the Home Secretary for involvement with an alleged Islamic terrorist organization. The SIAC ruled that the Home Secretary did not prove that Rehman’s actions were directed against the U.K. or its citizens. The Court of Appeal overturned SIAC’s decision, holding that in any national security case, the Home Secretary was entitled to examine the case as a whole and to make a decision to deport not only on the basis that a person had in fact endangered national security, but that he presented a danger to national security—even if it could not be proved to a high degree of probability that the person had engaged in any individual act that could justify such a conclusion. In October 2001, the House of Lords upheld the Court of Appeal decision stating that decisions in the interest of national security are not for the judiciary, but should be entrusted to the executive. Thus, although the SIAC is empowered to reject a certification if it does not agree with the Home Secretary’s belief or suspicion about a person, the Rehman case suggests that the SIAC has little effective discretion to overrule the Home Secretary. Moreover, Human Rights Watch is concerned that SIAC’s operational procedures violate basic due process guarantees. National security certifications could be made by the Home Secretary on the basis of secret evidence that would not be available to the person appealing certification or to her or his counsel. SIAC would also be empowered to hold appeals in camera, without the certified person or his counsel permitted to make representations to the committee. In such closed proceedings, an advocate would be appointed to appear for the certified person. The use of secret evidence in closed proceedings without the ability of the person subject to certification to confront the evidence against him in person with assistance of counsel of his choice violates fundamental due process standards. The absence of such key procedural guarantees coupled with the lack of transparency in SIAC’s proceedings raises further concerns regarding its status as an impartial and effective forum for appeals. The use of indefinite detention in the absence of basic procedural guarantees—including adequate recourse to appeal against arbitrary detention—violates international human rights law. Administrative detention for reasons of national security should be subject to a substantive and prompt review by an independent judicial or other authority. Moreover, any on-going periodic review of detention should occur at reasonable intervals. Human Rights Watch believes that review at six-month intervals leaves too long a period between evaluations and that reviews should be provided at shorter intervals. Administrative detainees under states of emergency should enjoy as a minimum the following rights and guarantees:  the right to be brought before a judicial (or other) authority promptly after arrest;    the right to receive an explanation of rights upon arrest in their own language or soon thereafter and to be informed of the reasons for the deprivation of liberty; specific, detailed and personalized reasons for the deprivation of liberty should be offered by the authorities,    the right of immediate access to family, legal counsel and a medical officer;    the right to communicate with and be visited by a representative of an international humanitarian agency, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) ;    the right to challenge, in a fair hearing and periodically if necessary, the lawfulness of the detention and to be released if the detention is arbitrary or unlawful;    the right to complain to a judicial authority about mistreatment;    the right to seek and obtain compensation if the detention proves to be arbitrary or unlawful.     Derogation The bill correctly notes that implementing the extended immigration detention provision would require the U.K. to invoke its ability to derogate from the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) under Article 15 and then to derogate officially from Article 5 of the convention.[7] Clause 30 of the bill would provide for the U.K.’s derogation from Article 5 of the ECHR. Derogation from obligations voluntarily undertaken as a state party to regional and international human rights instruments requires that certain objective circumstances giving rise to a public emergency obtain and that it is necessary for the state party to take exceptional measures to restore order. Article 15 of the ECHR states that:  In time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation any High Contracting Party may take measures derogating from its obligations under this Convention to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law.  The European Court of Human Rights has stated that a public emergency is an exceptional state of crisis affecting the entire population and threatening “the organized life of the community.”[8] Any measures taken to meet the challenge of such an emergency must be narrowly tailored “to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.” Although the court generally affords a contracting state a wide “margin of appreciation” to determine what constitutes an emergency and what measures are necessary to avert it,[9] the court retains oversight of whether a state has departed from its convention obligations only to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.[10] Article 4 of the ICCPR also permits derogation from certain convention provisions “in time of public emergency which threatens the life of the nation…[and] to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.” However, a state’s ability to derogate from the ICCPR is not unlimited. According to the U.N. Human Rights Committee’s interpretation of article 4, “This condition requires that States parties provide careful justification not only for a decision to proclaim a state of emergency but also for any specific measures based on such a proclamation…[T]hey must be able to justify not only that such a situation constitutes a threat to the life of the nation, but also that all their measure derogating from the Convenant are strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.” Moreover, the committee states that:  States parties may in no circumstances invoke Article 4 of the Covenant as justification for acting in violation of humanitarian law or peremptory norms of international law, for instance. . .through arbitrary deprivations of liberty or by deviating from fundamental principles of fair trial, including the presumption of innocence.[11]  In its concluding observations on U.K. compliance with the ICCPR released this month, the U.N. Human Rights Committee expressed concern that any derogation from the U.K.’s obligations under the ICCPR be in conformity with its international obligations:  The Committee notes with concern that the State Party, in seeking inter alia to give effect to its obligations to combat terrorist activities pursuant to Resolution 1373 of the Security Council, is considering the adoption of legislative measures which may have potentially far-reaching effects on rights guaranteed in the Covenant, and which, in the State Party’s view, may require derogations from human rights obligations. The State Party should ensure that any measures it undertakes in this regard are in full compliance with the provisions of the Covenant, including, when applicable, the provisions on derogation contained in article 4 of the Covenant.[12]  The U.K. thus must meet a high burden to show that rights circumscribed under the proposed bill meet the standards of derogation required by the ECHR and under international law. On November 12, Home Secretary David Blunkett announced that the U.K would officially declare a “state of emergency” thus permitting it to derogate from certain provisions of the ECHR. Blunkett assured the public that the declaration was a legal technicality—necessary to ensure that certain anti-terrorism measures that contravene the ECHR could be implemented—and not a response to any possible imminent terrorist threat.[13] In a statement to parliament on October 15 announcing the broad outlines of the emergency anti-terrorism measures, Blunkett stated that “[t]here is no immediate intelligence pointing to a specific threat to the United Kingdom.”[14] These public pronouncements raise the concern that the U.K. is seeking to derogate from its human rights obligations in the absence of conditions amounting to a bona fide state of emergency. Human Rights Watch urges the U.K. to justify any derogation from the ECHR and the ICCPR according to the substantive and procedural requirements of ECHR Articles 15 and ICCPR Article 4—and in the absence of any sufficient justification, decline to legislate a derogation. Refugee Protection and the Right to Seek Asylum  Human Rights Watch believes that clauses 33 and 34 of the bill would unduly restrict the individual right to seek asylum and violate international standards of refugee protection. These clauses would empower the Home Secretary to make a determination that an individual does not have the right to substantive consideration of his or her application for asylum if the Home Secretary considers that Articles 1(F) or 33(2) of the Refugee Convention apply. Article 1(F) of the Refugee Convention contains the so-called “exclusion clauses” and ensures that perpetrators of gross human rights violations (e.g. war crimes and crimes against humanity), serious non-political crimes outside the country of refuge, and acts contrary to the principles of the United Nations are excluded from refugee status. Article 33(2) allows for the return of a refugee who is considered a danger to the national security of a country and is the only exception in the Refugee Convention to the fundamental principle of nonrefoulement that protects refugees from return to a country where their life or freedom would be threatened. Given that the bill’s definition of a terrorist suspect extends to those who have “links with a person who is a member of or belongs to an international terrorist group”, it appears that the bill would empower the Home Secretary to exclude from refugee status and detain as national security threats refugees who have had no direct involvement with terrorist activities. As such, the bill contravenes both the spirit and the letter of the Refugee Convention. Article 1(F) of the Refugee Convention The Refugee Convention’s exclusion clauses are of an exceptional nature and should be applied strictly and in full accordance with their terms. Article 1(f) indicates a high evidentiary standard (“serious reasons”) and the requirement that the crimes were committed by the individual being considered for exclusion prior to reaching a country of asylum—not simply by an organization or other individual with which the asylum seeker might be associated. Article 1(F) does not refer to any perceived future threat as sufficient grounds for exclusion. Clause 33(1) of the draft bill empowers the Home Secretary to issue a certificate excluding a person from refugee status for activities that are not excludable offenses under the Refugee Convention—for example, association with a member of a terrorist organization or the perceived future national security threat posed by an individual rather than past criminal activity. Due to the nature of the appeals process provided in the bill, SIAC’s review of a certification may be based on incomplete information regarding an asylum seeker’s past activities since only the information used by the Home Secretary to certify a person as a suspected terrorist can be considered by the committee. Human Rights Watch believes that, given the grave consequences that the denial of refugee status may have, exclusion should only be considered following a full review of all the facts pertaining to an individual’s application for asylum. Such an approach is consistent with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees guidelines on the application of the exclusion clauses[15] and with more recent interpretations decided during the UNHCR Global Consultation on International Protection discussions on exclusion in May 2001.[16] That is, they are presumed to apply after a determination of refugee status is made to ensure that an individual’s circumstances are considered in full.[17] The fundamental principle guiding the Refugee Convention’s protection mandate is the presumption of inclusion on the basis of a full review of all the relevant facts surrounding an individual’s asylum claim before evidence is adduced of past criminal activity that would exclude an individual from being granted refugee status. This process is intended to cull all relevant facts from an asylum seeker’s past—for example, false criminal charges against an asylum seeker as a result of systematic discrimination or persecution of a political or ethnic group to which the individual belonged. In this way, evidence of alleged past criminal conduct can be fully reviewed to determine the authenticity of such charges or allegations and to evaluate whether or not such charges or allegations were part and parcel of the same type of persecution that the asylum seeker would face if he or she were returned to his or her country. The U.K. bill would reverse the “inclusion before exclusion” approach advocated by UNHCR. Rather, it would empower the Home Secretary to deny protection as a matter of first course, without benefit of a full determination of an individual’s asylum claim. This provision threatens to undermine the Refugee Convention’s protection mandate. Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention The guiding principle underpinning international refugee protection standards is the prohibition against refoulement, enshrined in Article 33(1) of the Refugee Convention which states that no convention party “shall expel, or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.” The principle of nonrefoulement applies both to direct return to a particular country and to indirect measures that may effectively return a refugee to a country where his life or freedom would be threatened. Under the Refugee Convention, the only instance in which a host country could expel a refugee who has not been excluded from refugee protection under Article 1(F) and return him to a place where his life or freedom would be threatened is under Article 33(2). Article 33(2) states that protection against refoulement “may not be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.” The two qualifications included in this provision require a direct link between the presence of the refugee within a territory and an existing national security threat to that country, and thus do not apply to a past political crime that does not endanger the security of the country of asylum. Therefore, a refugee is still protected against refoulement if he does not constitute a threat to the security of the country of asylum. It is important to note that Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention would generally apply to a person who has already been recognized as a refugee in the country of refuge. The consequences of overruling nonrefoulement protections are so serious that it would necessarily require a full and fair assessment of an individual’s fear of persecution before Article 33(2) could be applied. However, clauses 33 and 34 of the proposed bill would deny a full determination of refugee status in favor of a certification procedure for those suspected of terrorist activities. Human Rights Watch believes that it is not appropriate to make a certification when it is clear that the application of Article 33(2) requires an individual assessment. Moreover, an individual’s fear of persecution should always be balanced against the possible threat to national security. Clause 34 of the bill would raise particular concern as it prevents the SIAC from balancing an individual’s fear of persecution if returned to his own country against the government’s perceived threat to national security, an approach strongly advocated by the UNHCR. Moreover, recent jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Chahal v. United Kingdom, held that certain procedural guarantees enshrined in Article 32(2) of the Refugee Convention—which governs the expulsion of a refugee from the country of asylum on national security grounds—should also apply to those potentially subject to refoulement under Article 33(2). Article 32(2) provides that “Except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise require, the refuge shall be allowed to submit evidence to clear himself, and to appeal to and be represented for the purpose before a competent authority” and the refugee shall be permitted a reasonable time period within which to seek legal admission into another country. The same procedural guarantees should pertain to any decision to certify a recognized refugee as a suspected terrorist under Article 33(2). Asylum Appeal Rights All of these proposed restrictions on asylum rights would be compounded by clause 33(8) of the draft bill which restricts the right of appeal to a higher court for persons certified by the Home Secretary to pose a threat to national security when the SIAC has upheld that certification. Appeal in such cases would be permitted only on a point of law, thus essentially requiring the court to accept the facts as presented by the Home Secretary. Such a narrow right of appeal would prevent any higher court from examining the substantive part of a person’s asylum application or the factual and evidentiary issues regarding the SIAC’s decision to uphold a certificate. The Home Secretary also loses the right to appeal should a certificate be quashed by the SIAC, but the draft bill would allow the Home Secretary to issue another certificate under clause 27(9) “on the grounds of circumstance or otherwise.” Given the complex nature of an asylum application, particularly one in which issues of national security are considered a factor, all facts, not just those presented by the Home Secretary should be subject to judicial scrutiny in any appeals process. Denial of the possibility of further appeal unduly disadvantages the asylum seeker or refugee. Right to Seek Asylum The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) states in Article 14 that “everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.” The preamble to the 1951 Refugee Convention requires states to have regard for the UDHR when interpreting the convention’s provisions. The right to seek asylum has been increasingly at risk in recent years both in the U.K. and the E.U. as a whole. A range of border control measures—visa requirements, security checks, and other barriers to entry—often effectively prevent persons from applying for asylum. The right to seek asylum is violated, often together with the principle of nonrefoulement, when individuals cannot access fair and impartial asylum determination procedures. Human Rights Watch believes that denial of full and fair asylum determination procedures under the proposed certification procedure; use of the exclusion clauses and Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention to justify keeping people out, expelling them, or detaining them indefinitely; and the severe restrictions on appeals against the bill’s proposed procedures further restrict the right to seek asylum. These measures represent a departure from established refugee protection standards and undermine the purpose and intent of the Refugee Convention. It is particularly ironic that in the year the U.K. marks the 50th anniversary of the Refugee Convention and prepares to meet with other State parties in Switzerland next month to reaffirm its commitment to upholding the convention, it at the same time introduces legislation that seeks to weaken its obligations under this treaty. [1] Article 3’s prohibition against ill-treatment is absolute in expulsion cases. Whenever substantial grounds have been shown for believing that an individual would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if removed to another country, a contracting state must protect him or her against such treatment in the event of expulsion (see Chahal v. United Kingdom, 70/1995/576/662, 15 November 1996; Soering v. United Kingdom, 1/1989/161/217, A161, 7 July 1989; Vilvarajah and Others v. United Kingdom, 45/1990/236/302-306, A215, 30 October 1991). In these circumstances, the activities of the individual in question, however undesirable or dangerous, cannot be a material consideration. The protection afforded by ECHR Article 3 is thus wider than that provided by Articles 32 and 33 of the 1951 U.N. Convention on the Status of Refugees (see section below on refugee protection). [2] Under the U.K.’s current immigration laws, detention can only be used when there is an on-going removal proceeding in process and only for a “reasonable” amount of time. [3] The SIAC was established by act of parliament in 1997 to hear immigration appeals in cases of removal where deportation is deemed “conducive to the public good.” [4] Under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, foreigners can be detained only if a process with a view to deportation has commenced and is on-going. As well, the domestic law authorizing such a deprivation of liberty must be of sufficient quality to avoid the risk of arbitrariness; that is, it must—among other things—offer recourse to effective judicial review and provide set time limits for the duration of the detention. See Amuur v. France, 17/1995/523/609, Reports 1996-III, 25 June 1996. [5] The U.K. is a party to the ICCPR. See also the U.N. Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, General Assembly Resolution 43/173, annex, 43 U.N. GAOR Supp. (No. 49) at 298, U.N. Doc. A/43/49 (1988). The principles require that a person be informed promptly of any charges against him; prompt judicial review of legality of the detention; and commencement of trial within a reasonable time.

Security agents in Bujumbura, the capital of Burundi, arrested Jules Nteba Mbakumba of the Association Elimu, an NGO conducting adult education, on October 31 and handed him over to security agents in Uvira. Human Rights Watch researchers in the region witnessed Mr. Nteba, bound and guarded, entering the Direction Generale de Migration (DGM) security agency in Uvira. Security personnel in the DGM assured Human Rights Watch representatives of Mr. Nteba’s well-being while refusing to disclose the place where he would be held.  According to local sources, Mr. Nteba has been beaten in detention. “We are concerned about the safety of Jules Nteba. Any person arrested on a criminal charge must be brought without delay before a judicial authority and tried within a reasonable time or released,” said Alison Des Forges, senior adviser at the Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch has learned that since his arrest, Mr. Nteba has been held in several different venues, including the Rwandan military camp in Kavimvira, near Uvira, and reportedly at the private home of the Director of the DGM. On November 8 he was transferred to Brigade Speciale de Recherche (BSR) in Bukavu, and on November 9, Human Rights Watch learned he was transferred to Goma and detained in a dungeon called “Vicious Dog.”  In early August, RCD authorities charged the Association Elimu with producing leaflets for the Mai Mai rebels on their computer. The organization's office was searched and its computers and software seized. Following these accusations, Mr. Nteba received regular threats, and other members of Elimu were detained in Uvira. On October 11, he was arrested and detained in Bujumbura in connection with these accusations, but freed several days later following an interrogation by the public prosecutor in Burundi.  Uvira and Bukavu are located in the territory held by the RCD-Goma, and occupied by Burundian and Rwandan armies supporting the RCD. The RCD and its Burundian and Rwandan allies are fighting against the government of President Kabila. They are also fighting against several armed opposition groups, including Congolese Mai Mai rebels, and their Burundian allies the National Liberation Forces (Forces Nationales pour la Libération, FNL) and the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie, FDD).","Africa, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda","Free Speech"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/15/unfolding-events-afghanistan","Unfolding Events in Afghanistan","Unfolding Events in Afghanistan","","11/15/2001","(New York) -- There is a lack of clarity in many of the reports now coming out of Afghanistan as to when, by whom, and even whether human rights violations took place. The anti-Taliban forces have been responsible for some executions and looting, but more information is needed to determine if some of the reports of mass reprisal killings are accurate. For example, some sources have reported the deaths of hundreds of Taliban fighters in a school in Mazar-i Sharif following the Northern Alliance capture of the city on Friday, November 9. If those fighters had laid down arms and were prisoners of war (""""in the power of an adverse party""""); if they had clearly expressed an intention to surrender; or if they were unconscious, defenseless, or otherwise incapacitated, their deaths at the hands of Northern Alliance forces would clearly be a serious human rights abuse. Indeed, the murder of combatants in such circumstances is a grave violation of international humanitarian law, and constitutes a war crime.  If, however, as some reports suggest, the Taliban fighters were holed up in a school compound exchanging fire with opposing forces and were targeted in the process of that exchange, causing their deaths or wounding in this circumstance would not be considered a violation of international humanitarian law.  Under what is known as the """"combatant's privilege,"""" international humanitarian law does not prohibit soldiers from killing enemy combatants -- even if the opposing fighters are in retreat -- so long as they are not wounded, captured, or otherwise out of combat (hors de combat).  To know precisely what happened, it would be important not only to get impartial eyewitness accounts, but also to conduct forensic examinations of the bodies of those killed. Locations of bullet wounds, as well as any marks from rope burns on the wrists, for example, might be indications of executions.  In some cases, confusion may stem from the fact that Afghanistan has endured so much devastation that it is sometimes difficult to be able to determine at first sight whether destruction took place two days, two months, or two years ago.  Bamiyan province is a case in point. One news report suggested that Taliban forces retreating from this north-central area of Afghanistan, where the two giant Buddha statues were destroyed earlier in the year, might have engaged in """"ethnic cleansing"""" against the local Hazara population. That area has indeed been the site of some of the Taliban's worst atrocities in the past, but not in the last week.  In June 2001, the Taliban systematically burned down homes, shops, mosques, and other public buildings in the western part of Bamiyan. Most of the local population fled at the time to the surrounding hills, joining residents who had taken shelter there earlier in the year, while many of those who remained behind were reportedly killed by the Taliban.  Human Rights Watch remains concerned about the possibility of reprisal killings against civilians and those who have laid down their arms, as well as looting of badly needed humanitarian aid. Sources in Kabul told Human Rights Watch that Northern Alliance forces there were guarding humanitarian aid compounds and in some cases stopping looters.  In other areas, residents reportedly formed into local security groups to guard property. But with the Taliban retreat, the emergence of armed, unaccountable gangs may be an increasing problem.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Secretary Powell: In light of recent developments in Kabul and Mazar-i Sharif, it is more important than ever that future arrangements for governing Afghanistan include strong protections of human rights, so that there is no return to the lawlessness and brutality that paved the way for the Taliban in the early 1990's. We appreciate the sustained effort the United States has made to discourage the Northern Alliance from carrying out reprisal killings and other violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. Nevertheless, some Northern Alliance forces have committed serious abuses, including summary executions of captured Taliban fighters and looting, which can only hinder efforts to build a stable, broad-based government that commands the support of all Afghans.  And the danger of continued conflict and human rights abuses has not diminished now that the Northern Alliance has achieved most of its immediate military goals. On the contrary, the risk of fighting among factions competing for power may now be higher, and their incentive to heed U.S. calls for restraint may be smaller. But the United States and the international community still have great leverage, because of the role they will play in establishing and supporting a transitional Afghan government. The United States should make clear now to the future leaders of Afghanistan, both privately and publicly, that it will support an internationally coordinated effort to hold all parties accountable for grave abuses against civilians. And it should insist on arrangements that make such abuses less likely in the future. We would very much like to see the following principles incorporated in any efforts to build a future government in Afghanistan: 1. Excluding Perpetrators of International Crimes from a Future Government Persons responsible for the most serious abuses of human rights and humanitarian law must not be included in a new government. Discussions on how to achieve this goal should begin now, at the earliest stages of planning for a post-Taliban Afghanistan. Though many potential Afghan leaders may not have clean hands, at the very least, those implicated in crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other crimes of universal jurisdiction should be sidelined. Experience shows that past abusers who return to power often become repeat abusers. The inclusion of such leaders could also undermine efforts to create a government with broad support among Afghanistan's ethnic communities. 2. No Amnesties from Prosecution There should be no amnesties from prosecution for persons who have committed grave violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity. Amnesty arrangements often seem expedient in peace-building. But more often, they undermine progress, by giving victims the sense that their grievances do not matter, and leaders the sense that they can get away with further acts of violence. In Sierra Leone, for instance, a broad amnesty as part of the 1999 peace agreement contributed to its collapse a year later. That should not be allowed to happen in Afghanistan. 3. Obtaining Basic Human Rights Commitments Negotiators involved in efforts to establish of a broad-based government for Afghanistan should seek commitments to uphold Afghanistan's obligations as a party to international human rights treaties, as well as fundamental principles of human rights and humanitarian law. These should include guarantees of non-discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, particularly ethnic Hazaras and other Shia Muslims, as well as groups that may form minorities within specific regions, such as ethnic Pashtuns in northern Afghanistan. Attention should also be paid to developing transitional justice mechanisms that could adjudicate competing claims over land and property, while providing accountability for any continuing abuses committed by government officials and security forces. International assistance in the post-armed conflict period should include financial and other support, including training, for institutions involved in the administration of justice at all levels.  4. Women's Rights While the Northern Alliance have made a point of liberating women from the cruel policies of the Taliban, the Alliance's own practices have been far from perfect. It is vital that a new government establish clear laws guaranteeing the women's rights to education, free expression, mobility, employment, and health care, while ending the punishments for which women have been singled out in the past. Women who are currently in detention for violating discriminatory laws and edicts should be immediately released. The international community should also proactively seek out Afghan women to ensure that they are receiving the relief and aid they need, especially for education and health. Just as important, it should ensure that Afghan women are included in negotiations on the formation of a new government. There are many Afghan women leaders who have struggled for years against the brutality of the many factions of the civil war. Indeed, they have done more than anyone else to keep Afghanistan on the international agenda in recent years. A process that rejects their input from the outset will fail to meet their needs in the future - and it will lose any claim to being truly """"broad-based."""" 5. Establishing an International Monitoring Presence We hope that you will recommend the creation of an international monitoring capacity which can be deployed as soon as possible and wherever feasible in Afghanistan, to investigate past abuses and to monitor continuing violations of human rights. Valuable lessons can be drawn from past international missions: In El Salvador, the U.N. deployed an investigative commission even before hostilities ended in 1992; its work was vital in creating a climate of confidence in which a peace agreement could be reached. In Haiti and Kosovo, monitoring missions, by the U.N. and OSCE, respectively, helped to protect civilians in insecure areas. At a later date, when security in Afghanistan is improved, the establishment of a full-scale investigative mechanism should be considered, with three goals: creating a comprehensive record of abuses in Afghanistan, ending the climate of impunity within the country and laying the foundation for further steps to ensure accountability, including the possibility of a future special tribunal. 6. Screening out human rights violators from Afghan military and police forces Every effort should be made to disarm persons who have been implicated in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and to exclude them from Afghanistan's new armed forces and civilian police. Screening could be carried out by local authorities in conjunction with international monitors. Such screenings have been implemented in other contexts, for example in El Salvador, where the U.N. assisted efforts to disqualify military personnel from service on the basis of their past records, and in Bosnia and Hercegovina, where the U.N. conducted vetting of applicants for the civilian police.

Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, DC 20500   Dear President Bush,   We are writing to express our profound concern with the new Executive Order on the Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism, issued on November 13, 2001. We recognize that the existing state of emergency in the United States permits certain derogations of internationally protected human rights. Nevertheless, the broad reach of the executive order sacrifices fundamental rights to personal liberty and to a fair trial that go far beyond what is permitted even in times of crisis.  The United States has routinely condemned such gross transgressions of basic due process rights when committed by other governments because they violate binding international law to which the U.S. government and over 140 other governments have subscribed. For example, the United States has:  criticized the military courts in Peru that convicted U.S. citizen Lori Berenson for terrorism without adequate due process; indeed, the State Department called on Peru to retry the case """"in open civilian court with full rights of legal defense, in accordance with international judicial norms.""""  condemned Nigeria for convicting and executing author and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other activists after a trial before a special military court appointed by the government.  criticized the manner in which military tribunals are used to try accused terrorists in Egypt, pointing out in its most recent annual report on human rights in that country that """"military courts do not ensure civilian defendants' due process before an independent tribunal.  expressed great concern about trials of foreigners, including Americans, for espionage before closed tribunals in Russia.   If the Executive Order is implemented, it will do permanent damage to the United States' ability to champion human rights and the rule of law around the world. It will undercut the U.S. government's efforts to protect the rights of U.S. citizens before foreign tribunals. And it will undermine the human rights standards that you have said are key to distinguishing terrorism from lawful conduct.   The Executive Order raises important concerns regarding U.S. obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which the U.S. ratified in 1992. Article 4 of the ICCPR does permit a state to take measures derogating from its obligations under the Covenant in time of public emergency that threatens the life of the nation and is officially proclaimed. The U.S. declaration of a national emergency on September 14 may be considered to have met that condition, although to our knowledge the required formal notification of the U.N. Secretary-General has not occurred.   However, a state's ability to derogate from the ICCPR is not unlimited. Derogation is never permitted from certain rights, such as the right to be free from torture (article 7) and the prohibition of ex post facto laws (article 15). Otherwise, a state may derogate from its obligations under the ICCPR only """"to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation"""" and provided that such measures are not inconsistent with its other obligations under international law. The Human Rights Committee, the international body charged with interpreting the ICCPR and monitoring compliance with it, states in its General Comment on article 4 that """"This condition requires that States parties provide careful justification not only for their decision to proclaim a state of emergency but also for any specific measures based on such a proclamation....[T]hey must be able to justify not only that such a situation constitutes a threat to the life of the nation, but also that all their measures derogating from the Covenant are strictly required by the exigencies of the situation.""""   The U.S. must thus meet a high burden to show that the rights circumscribed under the Executive Order meet the standard for derogating from rights under the ICCPR. As discussed below, the Executive Order fails to meet this burden as it sharply curtails the right to liberty and security of the person under article 9 and the right to a fair trial under article 14. These rights not only are found in international law but are central to the fundamental rights of due process in the United States.   Right to Liberty and Security of Person   Section 2 of the Executive Order permits the arrest and detention of persons on grounds that are vague and overbroad. It allows taking a person into custody if the President has """"reason to believe"""" that the individual took part in """"acts of international terrorism"""" against the United States. Because neither the meaning of """"international terrorism"""" nor the nature of proscribed complicity is defined, the Executive Order is an extreme derogation of the ICCPR article 9 prohibition against arbitrary arrest and detention. Indeed, given the possibility that these provisions could be interpreted to proscribe conduct that was not already criminal, the Executive Order could even run afoul of the ICCPR's nonderogable prohibition of ex post facto criminal laws.   In addition, Section 3 of the Executive Order risks rendering ICCPR article 9 effectively meaningless by providing for conditions of detention that are distinct from those under existing U.S. law. Most significant are not the protections afforded detainees - including humane treatment, adequate food and water, access to health care - but those fundamental protections left off the list. There is no requirement, for example, that persons detained under the Executive Order be told the reason for their arrest or be promptly informed of charges against them; that persons deprived of their liberty be brought before a judicial authority who can decide on the lawfulness of their detention; or that those unlawfully arrested or detained shall have an enforceable right to compensation. Effectively the Executive Order allows for the arrest and indefinite detention of persons without charge and without legal recourse should they be unlawfully held. This is a clear abrogation of the fundamental right to liberty and security of person, well beyond the derogation permitted under article 4 of the ICCPR.   Right to a Fair Trial   Human Rights Watch believes the open-ended provisions for the trial of persons under the Executive Order also exceed the limits of acceptable derogation of the right to a fair trial under international law. Although the mere establishment of a military commission and various procedures set out in the Executive Order are not necessarily in violation of international law, the absence of key provisions regarding certain fundamental rights is a basis for extreme concern.   Section 4 of the Executive Order states that at a minimum all trials shall be """"full and fair,"""" but leaves the specifics open to future orders and regulations. For instance, there are no provisions for determining whether and to what extent trials should be public, nor even a requirement that judgments be made public. There is no requirement of a presumption of innocence, or that defendants have access to the evidence submitted against them, or even that proof of guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt. It is left undetermined to what extent defendants will have access to legal counsel of their choosing, whether they will be able to communicate with counsel, and whether adequate time and facilities will be provided for a defense. No protection is provided against forced confessions.   Section 7 of the Executive Order states that a terrorist suspect """"shall not be privileged to seek any remedy or maintain any proceeding, directly or indirectly, or to have any such remedy or proceeding sought on the individual's behalf"""" before a U.S. or any other court. Indeed, there is not even a provision for appellate review by a separate military commission panel, only non-judicial review by the President or the Secretary of Defense as the President's designate. This denies the defendant the right to an appeal provided under international law, which is especially troubling because the Executive Order expressly contemplates military commissions handing down death sentences. It also denies the right to effective redress to all persons, including U.S. citizens, who might be affected adversely by the law.   The comments made yesterday by Attorney General Ashcroft do nothing to correct these severe deficiencies. He claimed that because the terrorists responsible for the September 11th attacks committed war crimes, they """"do not deserve the protection of the American Constitution."""" But the U.S. government has repeatedly argued that people accused of war crimes deserve full due process protection. That is certainly the case for U.S. soldiers who might be accused of war crimes by foreign courts, and it has even been true of alleged war criminals in Bosnia and Rwanda. The United States cannot credibly insist on due process when others are the victims if it refuses to accord the same due process when Americans are the victims.   Human Rights Watch believes the Executive Order is contrary to fundamental principles of human rights. While the rights in question may be derogated from in times of emergency, the U.S. must show that this is being done only to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation. The far-reaching and ambiguous reach of the Executive Order strongly indicates that this is not the case. It is hard to imagine such a military commission escaping criticism by the U.S. government if created by another government. It is wrong and unlawful for the U.S. government to arrogate to itself the power to transgress these well established protections of international human rights law.   We urge you to rescind the Executive Order. Should any derogation from the rights provided under the ICCPR prove necessary, it should be done in a manner consistent with the strict requirements of international law.

Should Act to Free Child Soldiers","11/13/2001","(New York) - Dozens of students abducted from Burundian schools last week must be released and the Burundian rebel movement that captured them must stop such kidnappings, Human Rights Watch said today. The rebel group, the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD), abducted the students to serve as soldiers in their war against the Burundian government. “All parties – whether rebel or government – have used children to fight this horrible war. But dragging large numbers of students from school to make them into soldiers represents a new and alarming practice,” said Alison Des Forges, Senior Adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch called on Nelson Mandela, former president of South Africa and a mediator in the Burundian civil war, to make a plea for the release of the students. Mandela will address the United Nations Security Council this week. “A strong denunciation by Mandela and by the Security Council might convince the rebels to free the students,” said Des Forges. “It might even persuade the FDD to leave children at their books instead of pushing guns into their hands.” In an agreement mediated by Mandela, the Burundian government and opposing political parties share power in a transitional government installed on November 1. The most important Hutu-led political party in Burundi, FRODEBU, participates in the government, headed by Pierre Buyoya, a Tutsi. But the two Hutu-dominated rebel groups, the FDD and the Forces of National Liberation (FNL), are not part of the government and they have intensified the war since it took power. Representatives of FRODEBU and the FDD are to meet this week in Tanzania to discuss a cease-fire. The FDD rebels frequently take sanctuary in Tanzania and they have been supported by the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Human Rights Watch urged FRODEBU, as well as Tanzanian and Congolese leaders, to denounce the kidnappings. “It is leaders who talk to the FDD face to face who can best persuade them to observe the rules of war,” said Des Forges. FDD forces abducted more than fifty students in grades four to six from Kirambi primary school in the eastern province of Ruyigi on November 6. Three days later other FDD rebels abducted more than one hundred students from Musema high school in Kayanza province and burned the school to the ground. The rebels forced the students to transport goods stolen from nearby homes and shops and beat those who faltered en route. In previous attacks, rebels often obliged civilians to accompany them to transport looted goods and then released them. But last week rebels reportedly told the students that they would not release them and would turn them into soldiers to help in their war against the government, now in its eighth year. Many of the Musema students escaped from the rebels, some of them fleeing when government soldiers attacked the FDD forces. Several from Kirambi also evaded their captors and returned home. But dozens of students, mostly the younger ones, remain in rebel hands. The youngest child captured was twelve years old.","Africa, Burundi","Children's Rights, United Nations, Children and Armed Conflict, Attacks on Education"

The Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanors in Cairo sentenced twenty-two of the defendants to prison terms ranging from one to three years. One defendant facing an additional charge of “contempt for religion” was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment. Twenty-nine other defendants were acquitted.  “The government prosecuted these men in an unfair trial, apparently in order to distract public attention from their own unpopular policies, and to placate conservative elements in Egyptian society,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. Stork urged the Egyptian government to release the men immediately and unconditionally.  All fifty-two defendants were arrested in May this year and charged with “obscene behavior” after being suspected of engaging in consensual homosexual behavior. Two faced an additional charge of expressing “contempt for religion.” They were tried before an exceptional court whose proceedings violate international standards for fair trial. As a result, for instance, they are denied the right to appeal the verdict before a higher tribunal.  Stork condemned the Egyptian government’s increasing use of state security courts and military courts, whose verdicts are more susceptible to government influence.  “The other casualty of this miscarriage of justice is the further undermining of Egypt’s independent judiciary,” Stork said.  During pre-trial detention, some defendants told officials of the Supreme State Security Prosecution that they had been beaten and otherwise tortured in order to force them to confess to alleged homosexual behavior. Prosecution officials did not authorize medical examinations in order to verify their claims. By contrast, the defendants were subjected to forced medical examinations in order to determine whether they had engaged in anal intercourse.  In a related case, a 16-year-old boy who was also arrested in May was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment for alleged homosexual behavior. On September 18, 2001, the Juvenile Court in Cairo found him guilty of committing “obscene behavior” and passed down the harshest sentence possible under the law. He was also held incommunicado for two weeks after his arrest and reportedly beaten to force him to make a confession, which was then used as evidence against him in court. His October 31 appeal hearing has been deferred to November 21.  Human Rights Watch said that these convictions and the treatment to which the defendants were subjected violate a number of international human rights instruments to which Egypt is a state party. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","LGBT Rights"

We would very much like to see the following five principles incorporated in any efforts to build a future government in Afghanistan:   1. Excluding Perpetrators of International Crimes from a Future Government   In the immediate future, we call upon you to emphasize that persons responsible for the most serious abuses of international human rights and humanitarian law must not be included in a new government for Afghanistan. Discussions on how to implement this principle must begin now, at the earliest stages of planning for a post-Taliban government.

Experience shows that past abusers who return to power often repeat their abuses. 2. No Amnesties from Prosecution   We also urge you to embrace the principle that there must be no amnesties from prosecution for persons who have committed grave violations of international humanitarian law or crimes against humanity, in accordance with U.N. policy under Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Amnesty arrangements, while often seemingly expedient in peace-building, ultimately maintain a damaging culture of impunity.   In Sierra Leone, for instance, a broad amnesty as part of the 1999 peace agreement contributed to its collapse a year later. We urge you to categorically reject the possibility of any amnesty for violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity, including crimes against women.   3. Establishing an International Monitoring Presence   We hope that you will recommend the creation of an international monitoring capacity which can be deployed as soon as possible and wherever feasible in Afghanistan, to investigate past abuses and to monitor continuing violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.

Screening out human rights violators from Afghan military and police forces   Any plans for a future government in Afghanistan should contain measures specifically aimed at the issue of future military and police forces. Persons who have been implicated in violations of human rights and international humanitarian law should be disarmed and prohibited from joining the new armed forces and civilian police. This is imperative to prevent a continuing culture of abuse. As a practical matter, such sidelining should occur at all levels of the military and police power structures.

Promoting International Support for the Administration of Justice   We hope you will also try to ensure that international assistance in the post-armed conflict period include financial and other support for institutions involved in the administration of justice at all levels. As Ambassador Lakhdar Brahimi wrote in his 2000 report on peacekeeping: """"Where peace-building missions require it, international experts, penal experts and human rights specialists, as well as civilian police, must be available in sufficient numbers to strengthen rule of law institutions.

Eluay was abducted outside Jayapura, the capital of Papua (formerly Irian Jaya) on Saturday night [November 10], en route home from a ceremony marking Heroes Day at the local headquarters of Kopassus, the Indonesian army’s Special Forces. He was the chair of the Papua Presidium Council, a forum for the peaceful achievement of independence. """"This was clearly a well-planned assassination of one of Papua’s best-known leaders,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. """"We are calling on President Megawati to immediately establish a competent and impartial commission of inquiry into Eluay’s murder, preferably with international participation."""" According to local sources, Theys Eluay’s last hours began with his attendance at the provincial government’s Heroes Day reception at the Hotel Matoa in Jayapura at 6 p.m. From the hotel, he went directly to the Kopassus event in Hamadi, South Jayapura. He called his wife on his cell phone as he was leaving to tell her he was on the way home. At 10:10 p.m., Eluay’s driver, Aristoteles Masoka, made an anguished call to Eluay’s home saying that Eluay had been abducted by """"amber"""" – a local word for non-Papuans – in a place known as Skyline, the highest point around, between the villages of Entop and Kotaraja, located some ten kilometers from Jayapura. As the driver was speaking, the phone was cut off, according to Eluay’s family. His whereabouts are not known, and as he is the only eyewitness aside from the perpetrators, there are grave fears for his safety. The family immediately called the police, and on Sunday morning, Theys’ body was found together with his car in Koya, about nine kilometers from the Papua New Guinea border. Police took the body back to Jayapura for autopsy. The results of the autopsy were not public as of this writing. The motivation for the killing was not clear. The Papua Presidium last week had strongly rejected a law passed by the Indonesian parliament giving Papua political autonomy and a large share of locally-generated revenue, including from oil, gas, and mining. On December 1, Eluay was planning a public event to mark the anniversary of a December 1, 1961 declaration of independence by Papuan separatists. He had been arrested in the past for participating in pro-independence ceremonies on that day. Eluay was a controversial figure. He had been the foremost Papuan champion of integration with Indonesia in 1969 when a fraudulent exercise in self-determination, known as the """"Act of Free Choice"""", was conducted. Eluay was one of 1,025 tribal leaders hand-picked by the Indonesian government to represent the Papuan people in that referendum. He later suggested he had been coerced into supporting integration. In an interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation on May 31, 2001, Eluay said: """"During those days, especially during the so-called Act of Free Choice I myself for instance, I was taken from my home in the middle of night without my wife and children knowing about it, why I was taken and where I was being taken to. When I arrived to where the others were being interned we were all drilled that the province of West Irian, which it was called at the time belonged to the Republic of Indonesia, was an integral part of the Republic, we were not allowed to say anything else. We had to go along with that, we had to give in to the intimidation."""" He then became a member of the provincial parliament, representing the ruling party, Golkar, and was seen in the 1980s and early 1990s as having close ties to the local military. He was appointed by the governor of Irian Jaya in the late 1990s to head the Irian Jaya Customary Council, a council of traditional leaders. After President Soeharto resigned in May 1998, Eluay became an active supporter of independence, although he was still distrusted by many in the activist community. He was particularly disliked by the Organisasi Papua Merdeka (OPM), a guerrilla group fighting since the 1970s for the independence of the country they call West Papua. Not only were they wary of his past ties with the government and military, but once he started for working for independence through peaceful advocacy, they felt it undermined their armed struggle. But Eluay rapidly developed into a charismatic independence leader, with strong support particularly from Papua's coastal, as opposed to highland, peoples. His popularity as well as the power of his peaceful actions in support of independence made him the subject of close government scrutiny. On October 6, 1998, Theys Eluay was arrested together with five other pro-independence leaders and charged with having organized pro-independence demonstrations that had broken out across Irian Jaya the previous July. After massive popular pressure, he was eventually released, but the charges were not officially dropped. In late November 2000, he was arrested again and again charged with rebellion. The police cited a gathering at Theys’ home in Sentani, outside Jayapura, on November 12, 1000 at which he called for independence, and his role in an independence flag-raising ceremony on December 1, 1999. Eluay and other leaders went on trial in Jayapura in May 2001 but were not detained after the trial began. The trial was still ongoing at the time Eluay was killed. On Monday, November 12, he and his co-defendants were scheduled to be back in court to hear the last three witnesses presented by the prosecution. Theys Eluay was sixty-four. He is survived by a wife and seven children.","Asia, Indonesia",""

""""This is a basic violation of freedom of religion,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"Georgian authorities have indulged the perpetrators of violence against non-Orthodox Christians for too long.""""  Civilian militants, sometimes led by Orthodox priests, have targeted Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists and followers of other Christian faiths non-native to Georgia, beating congregants, ransacking and looting homes, and destroying religious literature. More than eighty attacks have been reported since 1999, with more than forty taking place this year. Emboldened by government, police, and judicial inaction, the frequency of attacks is rising. The leader of the majority of the attacks, Vasili Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Orthodox priest, openly admits to receiving help from the police and security services.  The authorities indicted Mkalavishvili in early September, but did not arrest him, leaving him free to organize new attacks. On September 24 Mkalavishvili led a demonstration on Tbilisi's central Rustaveli Avenue, and reportedly called for a widening of his campaign of religious violence.

President Bush will meet with Prime Minister Vajpayee on November 9 in Washington, and with President Musharraf on November 10 in New York.   Human Rights Watch cautioned against ill-considered changes to laws in all three countries that unnecessarily sacrifice due process and personal liberty in the name of fighting terrorism.  """"There is a temptation to think that tightening controls on freedom of expression and association will enhance state capacity to resist terrorism, but we've repeatedly seen the opposite,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The best way to guarantee security is to strengthen democratic structures. Respect for human rights must be part of any strategy to address terrorism and should be on the agenda of both meetings.""""  India The Indian government is on the verge of enacting the Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance (POTO), which is already temporarily in effect pending parliamentary action. The proposed legislation gives Indian police sweeping powers of arrest and detention and, if enacted, would reinstate a modified version of the notorious Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), repealed in 1995 after widespread public opposition. TADA facilitated tens of thousands of arrests, detentions, and acts of torture in violation of international law, and was used to crack down on political opponents, social activists, and human rights defenders. If enacted POTO could be put to similar misuse.  POTO has been strongly criticized by leading Indian civil rights groups, academics, lawyers, opposition parties, media organizations, and both religious and secular institutions. The country's National Human Rights Commission also maintains that existing laws are sufficient to fight the threat of terrorism.  Since the beginning of U.S.-led air strikes in Afghanistan on October 7, the Indian government has also clamped down on peaceful demonstrators protesting the strikes, labeling them """"anti-national elements."""" On October 7, for example, six Delhi University students were arrested for distributing pamphlets while protesting against the air strikes. Organizations protesting India's backing of the U.S.-led campaign have also faced increasing harassment from the police.  Human Rights Watch urges the government of India to: Suspend efforts to enact POTO and to repeal the temporary law. Ensure that the rights to freedom of expression and assembly are respected at all times. For more information on POTO see Human Rights Watch Press Release: India: Proposed Anti-Terror Law Should Be Rejected  Pakistan Under amendments made to the Anti-Terrorism Act in August, law enforcement agents can take legal action against “anti-government activities” including the holding of meetings, gatherings, and strikes. Meetings are defined as “a meeting of two or more persons,whether in public or private.” Human Rights Watch is concerned that the act will continue to be used by the government to suppress political opponents and to stifle legitimate dissent and expression  A government ban on all political meetings """"at public places, strikes and processions,"""" imposed in March 2000, also remains in force. This year alone, Pakistani authorities have arrested thousands of leaders and activists from the multiparty Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD) and from other political groups.  Rather than ensuring security in Pakistan, these measures have led to an atmosphere of increasing domestic unrest by stifling moderate voices. Over the past few months, Musharraf further consolidated his power with a set of orders that enhance his control over the Pakistani government and military, including his self-appointment to the presidency of Pakistan in June. While the government maintains that it will hold elections in October 2002, the ongoing erosion of civilian structures and civil liberties undermines hopes for a successful transition to democracy.  Human Rights Watch calls on President Musharraf to:  Revoke Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, the sedition law, and relevant provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act that limit freedom of expression and due process. Take steps to reverse recent power-consolidating measures that undermine his commitment to return the country to democratic rule. United States Since the September 11 attacks, governmental and nongovernmental monitoring groups have received several hundred complaints of bias attacks and hate crimes against people of Middle Eastern, Arab, and South Asian descent, including Indians and Pakistanis. The attacks range from murder and violent assaults, to the vandalizing and burning of mosques, Sikh and Hindu temples, stores, and homes.  Human Rights Watch welcomes President Bush's and other government officials' statements condemning such attacks and urges the U.S. and state governments to:  Adopt more effective measures to prevent hate crimes against persons of Middle Eastern, Arab, and South Asian descent. U.S. law enforcement officials should:  Provide enhanced protection for targeted individuals and groups, and their homes, places of business, and houses of worship; ensure that any reports of criminal behavior are properly investigated; and hold accountable those found responsible. For more on hate crimes in the U.S. see Human Rights Watch Press Release: Stop Hate Crimes Now The U.S.A. Patriot Act of 2001, signed by President Bush on October 26, gives broad, unprecedented powers to the U.S. Attorney General to certify and then detain non-citizens suspected of terrorist activities or of threatening national security. The law contains vague definitions of """"terrorism"""" and other key terms, and fails to provide meaningful judicial review for detainees wishing to challenge their certifications and subsequent detention. The new law also includes provisions that may lead to the indefinite detention of non-citizens.  The U.S. government has also detained more than 1,100 people as part of its investigation into the September 11 attacks, but it refuses to disclose basic information about the detainees.  Human Rights Watch urges the U.S. government to:  Ensure that accompanying rules and regulations to the U.S.A. Patriot Act clarify vague and overly broad language in the act.

The letter was also sent to Kim Beazley, leader of the opposition Australian Labor Party.   """"Over the past few years the Australian government has promoted a climate of xenophobia and hostility towards refugees, asylum seekers and migrants,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"The next government has got to do a better job of protecting refugees.""""  Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Committee for Refugees were particularly critical of recent amendments to Australian law that prevent most asylum seekers who arrive at offshore parts of Australia, such as Christmas Island, Ashmore and Cartier Islands, and the Cocos Islands, from making an asylum application. The Australian government transports some of these asylum seekers to other Pacific island states while their refugee claims are assessed. Others are simply sent back to sea.  """"Australia has created a legal fiction to avoid its international obligations towards refugees,"""" said Bill Frelick, Director of U.S. Committee for Refugees.  The advocacy groups said that by turning away boats of asylum seekers and forcing them back into international waters Australia could violate the fundamental principle of non-refoulement - the obligation not to send an asylum seeker in any manner whatsoever to a country where his or her life or freedom would be threatened. By denying asylum seekers access to refugee determination procedures, the legislation also undermines the fundamental right to seek asylum, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and places the lives of asylum seekers at risk.  The Australian government has pursued a policy of turning back boatloads of asylum seekers and migrants, most of them from Afghanistan, Iraq, and other countries in the Middle East and South Asia, and returning them to international waters since mid- August, when it turned away a boatload of 438 asylum seekers who were rescued by a Norwegian freighter, the Tampa, from a sinking Indonesian ferry. Most of the mainly Afghan asylum seekers were sent to the Pacific island state of Nauru; smaller numbers were sent to New Zealand.  Since then the Australian navy has intercepted and turned away several boatloads of asylum seekers. Many of the boats arrive in Australia via Indonesia, which is not a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and which lacks laws and procedures for determining refugee status. Although an understaffed UNHCR office functions in Indonesia, the government does not guarantee that asylum seekers will be protected from return to countries where they could face persecution. On October 19, 374 migrants and asylum seekers trying to reach Australia drowned when the dilapidated Indonesian fishing boat they were traveling on sank.  The two organizations also criticized measures under the new legislation that narrow the definition of a refugee and require the detention of asylum seekers arriving at an """"excised offshore place"""" without any right to judicial review. Australia's policy of mandatory detention for all unauthorized arrivals, including asylum seekers, and its failure to inform immigration detainees of their legal rights have already been heavily criticized by human rights groups and the international community.  """"The potentially indefinite detention of all non-citizens and asylum seekers without judicial review violates fundamental norms against prolonged arbitrary detention,"""" said Frelick. """"Australia should as a matter of priority review its immigration detention policies to ensure that they comply with its international obligations.""""  Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Committee for Refugees made a plea to the next government to amend the new provisions in Australian law to ensure that they are consistent with international human rights and refugee law, and in the interim to ensure that the legislation is implemented in a manner that upholds fundamental human rights principles.  Finally, the two groups called on the next Australian government to end the use of inflammatory and xenophobic rhetoric when explaining Australia's refugee and immigration policies and to provide the public with full information about Australia's share of the global refugee crisis.  """"The Australian government tends to give the impression that it is being overrun by asylum seekers,"""" said Roth. """"In reality, Australia takes in a tiny proportion of the world's refugees.""""  Between January and July 2001, 7,886 individuals sought asylum in Australia - most of them from Afghanistan and Iraq. In the same period 39,255 people sought asylum in the United Kingdom and 48,879 in Germany. In 2000, the ratio of refugees to total population was 1: 1,138 in Australia, 1: 681 in the United Kingdom, and 1: 456 in Germany. In contrast, much poorer countries such as Pakistan and Iran, hosted more than two million and 1.5 million Afghan refugees respectively, a ratio of 1: 75 and 1: 36 refugees to total population in each country.

The WTO summit will take place from November 9 to 13. The part of the WTO agreement dealing with patents, known as TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights), allows exceptions to patent rules in the case of a national emergency or where a product will have non-commercial uses. Fifty-developing countries and Norway are urging the WTO ministers in Doha to make a pledge not to impede legitimate use of emergency exceptions to TRIPS. In negotiations leading up to the Doha summit, the U.S. and a number of other countries that are home to the major multinational pharmaceutical companies have been intransigent in opposing this pledge.  The United States has also bilaterally threatened sanctions against several countries with severe AIDS problems, such as Thailand, South Africa and Brazil.  """"AIDS is already tearing these countries apart,"""" said Joanne Csete, director of the HIV/AIDS program at Human Rights Watch. """"They shouldn't face sanctions from the developed world on top of that.""""  Approximately 9,000 persons a day die of AIDS, the large majority in countries where anti-retroviral drugs are unavailable or unaffordable. More than 22 million people have died of AIDS, about 18 million of them in sub-Saharan Africa.  The office of the U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick announced last week that instead of the 53-country proposal reinforcing the health emergency exceptions in TRIPS, it would support a counter-proposal that would give """"least developed countries"""" more time until they are required to be fully compliant with TRIPS and would impose a five-year moratorium on initiation of WTO complaints against countries seeking TRIPS exceptions.  Csete noted that the U.S. proposal is a step in the right direction but would cover only the poorest countries and would not include others such as Brazil and South Africa that have capacity for domestic production of generic drugs. She urged the United States not to use bilateral threats and sanctions when the global system allowed exceptions that Washington opposed.  The United States, Canada, Japan and the United Kingdom have been granted exceptions to TRIPS and the pre-WTO trade rules many times to protect their own interests in areas as wide-ranging as pharmaceuticals, computers, software, and biotechnology innovations. Canada recently said it would seek a compulsory license  a license to produce and import the generic version of a brand-name medicine  to ensure its stock of anti-anthrax drugs. New Zealand, Australia and Italy have also used compulsory licensing as an antitrust measure.  In contrast, no low-income developing country has succeeded in obtaining a compulsory license for generic AIDS drugs. The United Nations Development Programme's """"Human Development Report 2001"""" attributes this disparity to threats from Europe and the United States of trade sanctions, loss of foreign direct investment, or litigation against low-income countries hoping to obtain compulsory licenses. Earlier this year, for example, the U.S. threatened to put Thailand on """"priority watch""""  a disadvantageous trade status  in response to the Thai government's attempt to shorten the waiting period for production of generic drugs in Thailand after the release of their brand-name counterparts. (An estimated 750,000 persons in Thailand suffer from AIDS.) A similar U.S. action against Brazil, brought through the WTO, was dropped this year only in the face of heavy international pressure against the case.","Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Canada, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Qatar, Global","Economic Justice and Rights, Health, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Takeo Hiranima Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Tokyo, Japan Dear Mr. Hiranima: The WTO ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar provides an ideal occasion for Japan to make a new commitment to multilateral and bilateral trade policy consistent with concern for the global crisis of HIV/AIDS. We are writing to urge your leadership toward a commitment from the Japanese government to allowing all countries suffering from HIV/AIDS' devastation to make full use of TRIPS exceptions in their pursuit of access to affordable anti-AIDS drugs for their populations.  The vast majority of the more than 22 millions deaths from AIDS thus far have occurred in countries where treatment for AIDS is largely unaffordable. The overwhelming majority of the more than 36 million persons infected today live in countries where they can have no reasonable hope of affordable treatment. HIV/AIDS is an unprecedented social, economic and human rights crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. It has killed 18 million Africans in the prime of their productive lives and left a generation of desperate and impoverished orphans.  The recent proposal of the United States Trade Representative to extend the transition period for TRIPS compliance for least developed countries in Africa to the year 2016 and to place a moratorium on initiation of disputes against these countries is a step in the right direction. This proposal, however, does not go far enough. Firstly, Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe would not be covered by these measures since they are not currently classified as """"least developed."""" For all of these countries, HIV/AIDS is a national emergency. In at least two of these countries, government officials have spoken publicly about pressures on them from the WTO or from trade representatives in wealthy countries to refrain from discussions of compulsory licensing or parallel importation of generic versions of antiretroviral drugs. In addition, this proposal does nothing for countries such as Thailand, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and others that are either not """"least developed"""" or not in Africa but have HIV/AIDS problems that constitute national emergencies.  Secondly, we are concerned that developed country members of WTO have not always pursued bilateral trade policies that are consistent with the spirit of the emergency provisions of TRIPS, particularly as they can be of assistance to countries in HIV/AIDS emergencies. WTO member states that are committed to the application of TRIPS to all countries must not use bilateral trade policies to undermine AIDS-affected countries' ability to use TRIPS provisions to address national emergencies. Thirdly, unless wealthy countries provide more leadership to increase the support of the international community for greater investment in the HIV/AIDS problem in Africa, Asia and Latin America, there is no reason to think that things will be much different in 2016 than they would be in 2006 or than they are now. The Global Fund established by the United Nations Secretary-General as one mechanism for mobilizing resources of the international community to address the HIV/AIDS crisis has attracted only a fraction of the estimated $7 to $10 billion needed annually.  We urge you to use the Doha summit to make a clear and unambiguous pledge that Japan will use neither multilateral nor bilateral pressures to prevent AIDS-affected countries that have judged HIV/AIDS to constitute a national emergency from using the full range of TRIPS provisions to increase anti-AIDS drug access for their people.

We are writing to urge your leadership toward a commitment from the U.S. government to allowing all countries suffering from HIV/AIDS' devastation to make full use of TRIPS exceptions in their pursuit of access to affordable anti-AIDS drugs for their populations.  The vast majority of the more than 22 millions deaths from AIDS thus far have occurred in countries where treatment for AIDS is largely unaffordable. The overwhelming majority of the more than 36 million persons infected today live in countries where they can have no reasonable hope of affordable treatment. HIV/AIDS is an unprecedented social, economic and human rights crisis in sub-Saharan Africa. It has killed 18 million Africans in the prime of their productive lives and left a generation of desperate and impoverished orphans.  Your recent proposal to extend the transition period for TRIPS compliance for least developed countries in Africa to the year 2016 and to place a moratorium on initiation of disputes against these countries is a step in the right direction. This proposal, however, does not go far enough. Firstly, Kenya, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe would not be covered by these measures since they are not currently classified as """"least developed."""" For all of these countries, HIV/AIDS is a national emergency. In at least two of these countries, government officials have spoken publicly about pressures on them from the WTO or from trade representatives in wealthy countries to refrain from discussions of compulsory licensing or parallel importation of generic versions of antiretroviral drugs. In addition, this proposal does nothing for countries such as Thailand, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and others that are either not """"least developed"""" or not in Africa but have HIV/AIDS problems that constitute national emergencies.  Secondly, we are especially concerned that the United States' history of bilateral actions belies the spirit of your recent proposal and shows a consistent pattern of putting patent protections above the emergency needs of countries heavily affected by HIV/AIDS. U.S. pressures on Thailand in response to the January 2001 resolution of the Thai Food and Drug Administration on the waiting period for generic drug production are just one recent example of these actions. The U.S.' continued support for """"TRIPS-Plus"""" measures in new trade agreements for the Americas and in the recent U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement also fly in the face of the U.S.' stated concern for countries affected by HIV/AIDS. The conditionalities in the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (H.R. 2489 of 1999), which predate your appointment as Trade Representative, include reviewing a country's record on intellectual property before granting trade preferences. It is hypocritical for the U.S. as a member state of WTO to appear to be pushing the WTO to allow greater capacity for AIDS-affected countries to use the emergency provisions of TRIPS and at the same time to be pursuing bilateral trade policies that undercut that capacity.  Thirdly, unless the U.S. and other wealthy countries provide more leadership to increase the support of the international community for greater investment in the HIV/AIDS problem in Africa, Asia and Latin America, there is no reason to think that things will be much different in 2016 than they would be in 2006 or than they are now. The Global Fund established by the United Nations Secretary-General as one mechanism for mobilizing resources of the international community to address the HIV/AIDS crisis has attracted only a fraction of the estimated $7 to $10 billion needed annually. The U.S. government's own contribution to that effort, which will apparently be $190 million rather than the $200 million earlier announced, is grossly incommensurate to the crisis.  We urge you to use the Doha summit to make a clear and unambiguous pledge that the United States will use neither multilateral nor bilateral pressures to prevent AIDS-affected countries that have judged HIV/AIDS to constitute a national emergency from using the full range of TRIPS provisions to increase anti-AIDS drug access for their people.

Human Rights Watch staff work closely with these brave individuals as part of our defense of human rights in more than 70 countries around the world.   """"Those we honor have shown great courage and dedication to the cause of human rights,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"They have worked tirelessly - often in dangerous environments -- to expose rights abuses and to turn the international spotlight on their countries.""""   The 2001 Human Rights Watch Annual Dinners in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco will honor: a domestic worker from Guatemala, a leading human rights lawyer from Aceh, Indonesia, a recently released political prisoner from Uzbekistan, the head of Pakistan's leading human rights group, and a Sudanese minister working to end slavery and Sudan's 18-year civil war.   Human Rights Watch is a non-profit, international monitoring group with headquarters in New York. It accepts no financial support from any government.   ________________________________________    The 2001 Human Rights Watch Honorees are:   Afrasiab Khattak (Pakistan)   Afrasiab Khattak heads the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), one of the country's leading non-governmental organizations. In this role, Khattak has been one of the most outspoken advocates for the protection of Afghan refugees in Pakistan, challenging government policies and practices aimed at deporting existing refugees and curbing further inflows. HRCP has also been a standard-bearer in calling for the restoration of democracy in Pakistan since the military coup in October 1999. Khattak's work as an activist extends back to previous elected and military governments. Arrested for his opposition to the martial law regime of General Zia ul-Haq, he was convicted by a military court in 1979 and sentenced to a year of labor in prison. Following his release, he spent nearly a decade in exile, returning in 1989 after Zia's death. In the current crisis in Afghanistan, Khattak has publicly articulated the need for Afghan civil society actors to play a prominent role in the country's reconstruction.   Ismail Adylov (Uzbekistan)   Ismail Adylov is a long-time human rights activist and political dissident in Uzbekistan. After he was arrested in 1994, he joined the Independent Human Rights Organization of Uzbekistan and investigated cases of illegal arrest, monitored trials, and conducted dozens of interviews with victims of torture and their families. In the spring of 1999, the Karimov government launched an aggressive campaign against Adylov and his colleagues, apparently aimed at silencing their revelations regarding religious repression and mass violations of human rights by state authorities. In July of that year, Tashkent police took Adylov into custody and raided his home. A court hearing that lasted only three hours and mimicked Soviet-era show trials declared him guilty; Adylov was sentenced in September 1999 to six years in prison. For most of the time he was in prison, Adylov was subjected to torture and denied medical treatment. After a large-scale international campaign calling for Adylov's release, President Karimov finally granted his freedom on July 3, 2001.   Dr. Haruun Ruun (Sudan)   Dr. Haruun Ruun is the head of the New Sudan Council of Churches, which comprises Catholic and Protestant churches in rebel-held areas of southern Sudan. Sudan is in the eighteenth year of a civil war that pits the Arab and Muslim-dominated central government against marginalized African peoples. He has done significant human rights-related work in connection with the People-to-People peace and reconciliation process, which aims to bring together citizens in southern Sudan to promote an end to the conflict between ethnic groups in the south. In this role, Ruun, a U.S.-educated Presbyterian minister, has helped address such problems as returning abducted women and children to their families, attempting to implement a local system of law and order, and searching for funds for the rebuilding of villages destroyed in the conflict. The New Sudan Council of Churches has taken a brave stand against oil exploration in southern Sudan, which has caused the forced displacement of countless citizens who have not been compensated at all for their land, the destruction of their homes and livelihoods, or the death or injury of their relatives.   Abdul Rahman Yacob (Indonesia)   Abdul Rahman Yacob is a lawyer in Aceh, Indonesia with a coalition of human rights organizations, known by its Indonesian name of Koalisi HAM. Aceh is in the midst of a war between Indonesian army and police on the one hand, and guerrilla forces of the Free Aceh Movement on the other. In such a situation, human rights documentation and advocacy is not only crucial, it is extremely dangerous; one Koalisi lawyer was shot to death in March 2001. Under the leadership of Rahman, Koalisi is producing some of the most thorough, timely, and accurate reporting on human rights violations in Aceh. He has taken on the defense of some of Aceh's highest-profile political prisoners. These include a student leader imprisoned for actively campaigning for a referendum on Aceh's political status and GAM officials arrested for rebellion in the midst of negotiations with the Indonesian government. Rahman is so accustomed to receiving threats that he treats them as commonplace, but in a hazardous occupation, Rahman takes on more hazards than most.   Rosa Isabel García (Guatemala)   Rosa Isabel García, a 22-year-old K'iche' woman, has been a domestic worker for seven years. García is on the executive council of CENTRACAP, an organization run by current and former domestic workers. It provides services to domestic workers and focuses on literacy, self-improvement, and vocational classes. CENTRACAP sponsors activities to improve workers' knowledge of their rights in the workforce and engages in advocacy with Congress and other state institutions to promote these rights. García represents the thousands of indigenous girls and women who migrate every year to the capital in search of employment as live-in household workers. Both indigenous and non-indigenous domestic workers encounter legal discrimination and daily exploitation. While her story is typical, García herself is exceptional. In addition to working full-time, García is studying to become a teacher so that she may return to her home province and expand the opportunities for young girls there.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Guatemala, Sudan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Uzbekistan",""

Arms Embargo Failing","Weak Export Controls Largely to Blame ","11/05/2001","(New York) - The United Nations Security Council must enforce the international arms embargo on Liberia, Human Rights Watch said today. A new U.N. report, prepared by an independent panel of experts and scheduled for discussion at the Security Council today, documents many cases of illegal arms shipments to Liberia in the past eighteen months.  """"The arms flows into Liberia make a mockery of U.N. sanctions,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"These weapons fuel brutal wars and feed regional instability-with terrible consequences for human rights.""""  The Liberia arms embargo was first imposed in 1992 and tightened in March 2001 to curb arms trafficking via Liberia to the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels in Sierra Leone, who are also subject to a U.N. embargo. There has been progress toward disarmament in Sierra Leone, but fighting continues on the border between Guinea and Liberia.  The new U.N. report, which presents detailed information and documentary evidence, reveals that the weapons shipped illegally to Liberia - comprising ammunition, small arms, and helicopter spare parts - came from Ukraine, Slovakia, and Kyrgyzstan, respectively. Two shipments of helicopter gunships, one from Kyrgyzstan via Slovakia and another from Moldova, were halted at the last moment. Planned shipments of massive quantities of small arms from Ukraine were also interrupted. All of the weapons were sold on the basis of counterfeit documents provided by arms brokers. These documents, called end-user certificates, falsely declared the weapons were intended for another country, in most cases Guinea. In at least one case, a regional ally knowingly provided false cover for illegal arms shipments to Liberia.  The arms-trafficking networks of two well-known arms dealers also used fraud to conceal the operations of the front companies and airlines involved in the Liberia shipments.  The pattern echoed what earlier U.N. investigations, as well as research by Human Rights Watch, had uncovered in Angola and Sierra Leone. (See, for example, Human Rights Watch, """"Neglected Arms Embargo on Sierra Leonean Rebels,"""" May 2000, and """"Angola Unravels,"""" September 1999.) According to the U.N. report, not one of the exporting countries' governments checked to see if Guinea, the purported end-user, had actually requested the weapons.  """"Arms export controls in central and eastern Europe are a disgrace,"""" said Hiltermann. """"That makes it easy for arms traffickers to get away with their deadly trade."""" He urged that arms-exporting governments and multilateral institutions such as the European Union and NATO do more to curb irresponsible arms trading in the region. (See Human Rights Watch, """"Letter to E.U. Foreign Ministers on Security Concerns Raised by Arms Transfers from Candidate Countries,"""" October 19, 2001.) Human Rights Watch called on the Security Council to urgently implement the following key recommendations contained in the Liberia panel's report:  Immediately ground all aircraft owned, operated, or insured by the companies identified in the U.N. report as having arranged illegal arms flights to Liberia. Encourage member states to investigate all arms deals involving any of the companies or individuals named in the report and to communicate their findings to the U.N. sanctions committees. Establish a U.N. working group to rapidly develop a standardized end-user certificate that would be difficult to forge. Human Rights Watch also recommended that the Security Council call on U.N. member states to enact national laws that implement U.N. arms embargoes and to prosecute violators. It further urged the Security Council to authorize UNAMSIL peacekeepers in Sierra Leone to monitor and enforce the arms embargo in force on the RUF there, especially in Kailahun district, and make public the information it collects. Finally, it called on the Security Council to establish a permanent U.N. unit to monitor and report on arms embargo violations.","Africa, Liberia","Arms, United Nations"

Bush, Human Rights Watch urged Bush to raise concerns about the recent massacre by soldiers in Benue State, Central Nigeria.  President Obasanjo is due to meet separately with President Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell on Friday, November 2 to discuss anti-terrorism measures. “The anti-terrorism agenda must not prevent President Bush from condemning human rights violations by the Nigerian security forces,” said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Africa division. “Failure to raise these concerns just days after the Nigerian army killed unarmed civilians and destroyed homes and property would send a dangerous signal about U.S. commitment to human rights in Nigeria.” Human Rights Watch issued a statement on October 25 condemning the actions of the Nigerian military in Benue State. The soldiers were apparently acting in revenge for the earlier killing of 19 soldiers attributed to an armed group. Initial figures indicated that at least 100 people had been killed in the military reprisal that began on October 22, but on the basis of information received since then, Human Rights Watch believes that the real civilian toll is likely to be significantly higher. The situation in the area remains critical, with tens of thousands of people displaced by the violence.  President Obasanjo has thus far failed to condemn the army's actions. “We deplore the absence of any recognition on the part of the government of the gravity of what happened in Benue,” said Takirambudde. “If the U.S. Government considers Nigeria to be a close ally, it has a responsibility to condemn these atrocities and urge President Obasanjo to investigate the events and bring those responsible to justice.”","Africa, United States, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/11/01/human-rights-defenders-barcelona-era","Human Rights Defenders in the Barcelona Era","Human Rights Defenders in the Barcelona Era","A Human Rights Watch Backgrounder","11/01/2001","The five years since the inauguration of the Barcelona process has witnessed a considerable dynamism in the area of human rights activism. The indicators of this dynamism are numerous, and include:  The number of groups monitoring human rights generally or campaigning on specific issues--whether these be violence against women or investigating the fate of the """"disappeared""""--have grown in number and sophistication.    Across the Euro-Mediterranean region, activists, lawyers, writers, jurists, artists, health professionals, youth organizers, and others have integrated human rights issues into their professional work.    From Morocco to Syria, from Turkey to Tunisia, human rights activists and organizers have displayed extraordinary courage in challenging the repressive and abusive practices of governments, and confronted the intolerance of non-governmental social forces, especially in the press and some professional associations. Such space as they have managed to occupy in any given society is invariably the result of their continuing struggles to do so.    This period has also seen the development of regional human rights networks. The large and very public meeting of Arab human rights activists in Casablanca in April 1999 was one sign of this. Specialized regional networks such as the Center for the Independence of Judges and the Judiciary, and the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists is another. So is the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Network (EMHRN), linking groups in the Middle East with international and European counterparts, or the meeting sponsored by the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) bringing together groups working on the issue of """"disappearances."""" Other informal networks--their informality compelled by continuing governmental hostility--provide further opportunities for sharing concerns and strategies.     One could perhaps argue, to keep this picture in perspective, that such signs of growth and dynamism were a reflection of a similar flourishing globally. The human rights movement in the Middle East is arguably the youngest in the world. Its higher visibility and greater presence today is laudable but its presence and influence remain proportionately behind those in other regions. One thing that has changed very little in the five years since Barcelona is the extremely low tolerance of governments in the Euro-Mediterranean region for the monitoring and public reporting activities of human rights defenders. Four of the Barcelona partner governments--Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, and Syria--co-signed a statement of reservations to the U.N. Human Rights Defenders' Declaration effectively declaring themselves unbound in any practical way to the protections it specifies and proclaiming that domestic legislation supersedes any obligation to uphold international standards in this regard. The practice of other Euro-Mediterranean partner states has shown similarly little intent on their part to uphold the standards of the declaration. Unfortunately this low tolerance of the """"southern"""" partners appears to have been matched by a high tolerance of their """"northern"""" counterparts for such behavior, reflected in the failure of the European Council to address the systematic assaults on the work of human rights defenders in the region. Back in 1995, the year of Barcelona, Hasan al-Alfi, then Egypt's Minister of Interior, crudely lambasted Egyptian human rights groups in no uncertain terms. """"Unfortunately, these organizations obtain their information from offenders, wierdos, and people who have a vested interest,"""" he said. Specifically with reference to a series of Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) studies on different prisons, he dismissed them as """"sheer lies and fabrications...aimed at tarnishing Egypt's image."""" A year later President Mubarak sounded a similar note, charging that rights groups """"interfere in the internal affairs of the country.... They are just defending terrorists and criminals."""" While one does not usually come across such unvarnished official animosity today, at least in public fora, the fundamental attitude appears to have changed little. Consider, for instance, Algerian President Bouteflika's dismissal of the calls of human rights groups--Algerian as well as international--for inquiries to establish responsibility and accountability for mass killings. """"Intellectual coquetry,"""" he snorted when he was asked about this on a visit to Canada in April. The disdain President Bouteflika expressed on that occasion is expressed every day by officials in the ministries of justice and the interior when they respond--or more to the point do not respond--to the families of individuals who have not been seen from the time four or five or six years ago when they were picked up by one branch or another of the security forces. The same disdain marks the demeanor of the Algerian generals who wield power behind the presidency and who have yet to be called to account for their failure to protect thousands of ordinary Algerians massacred in towns and hamlets, some of them nearly adjacent to military posts. In no Euro-Mediterranean country have human rights defenders paid a higher price than Syria. No locally-based human rights organizations are allowed to operate freely and with the protection of legal status. Of the ten activists associated with the Committees for the Defense of Democratic Freedoms and Human Rights (CDF) who were imprisoned in 1992, three--Nizar Nayouf, Muhammad Ali Habib, and Afif Muzhir--remain in detention, Nayouf disabled from years of torture under interrogation and reportedly in solitary confinement in Mezze military prison. Syria has dismissed the concerns Human Rights Watch and other organizations have raised about Nayouf's poor health, and in the process repeated charges that the CDF activists had """"deliberately fabricated lies against Syria and caused her harm, under the pretext of defending human rights."""" Tunisia takes a different approach from that of Syria. The government boasts incessantly of its commitment to human rights, but there are few countries where the gap between such claims and the actual record is so vast. When independent Tunisian activists, at great risk to themselves, attempt to set the record straight, the authorities display no tolerance for such views. Consider President Zine Abidine Ben Ali's response to demands of Tunisian activists to register the Conseil Nationale des Libertés Tunisienne (CNLT) and allow it to carry on its monitoring activities as a recognized, legally protected organization. """"It is out of the question that in the name of public liberties illegal structures are set up claiming for themselves the status of associations, organizations, or committees,"""" he ranted at a July rally for ruling party cadre, with unmistakable reference to the CNLT. In that same speech he denounced as """"traitors"""" those who spoke openly about Tunisia's awful human rights record, especially those who spoke abroad, and the next day Dr. Moncef Marzouki, the CNLT spokesman who had just returned from a visit to Paris, London, and Washington, was fired from his position at the school of medicine of the University of Sousse. Last month, in October, Dr. Marzouki was prevented from leaving the country (for a meeting in Barcelona to discuss the Barcelona process). He is presently under investigation and has been summoned for interrogation in connection with a paper he authored and circulated privately at a meeting of Arab human rights defenders in Morocco in late September. It is well known that one of the few areas of inter-Arab government cooperation, real cooperation, is among the ministries of interior and the security apparatuses that are answerable to them. In a January 1997 interview in An-Nahar, Lebanon's Minister of Interior Michel Murr described a meeting of interior ministers of Arab League member states in Tunis a few months earlier. The ministers, he said, """"were complaining of the human rights organizations in their countries."""" """"The work of these organizations and their movements do not aim to protect human rights but to paralyze security operations and countries' security policies,"""" he added. Murr indicated that the ministers decided to contact Western governments funding these organizations and ask them to cease this support. We do not know if the interior ministers came up with an agreed-upon plan of action at this or subsequent meetings, but we can discern clear trends in the way that Arab governments have been dealing with NGOs generally and human rights organizations in particular. Here Tunisia and Egypt have been the unmistakable trendsetters:  Appropriate the discourse of human rights.    Establish high profile but low-impact human rights offices in key ministries such as foreign affairs, justice, and the interior.    Draw up restrictive legislation governing the activities of NGOs.    Allow some groups to function legally but undertake surveillance and harassment at levels that make it impossible for them to function effectively.    Punish those who challenge these limits """"within the law""""--the laws in this case being penal code provisions against """"spreading false information,"""" """"defaming public order,"""" or the like.    Encourage or sponsor the establishment of organizations representing themselves as independent but whose main function is to defend the government's human rights practices and disrupt efforts of genuine human rights defenders to carry out their activities.     It is difficult to find tangible evidence that the Euro-Mediterranean process initiated at Barcelona has to date brought any improvement or improved protection to the human rights defenders in the region. Any effort to evaluate the situation of defenders after five years of Barcelona must take note of the March 1999 evaluation of the """"MEDA Democracy Program"""" prepared for the European Commission, which explained that Syria and Tunisia received the smallest amount of grants owing to """"the severe political obstacles to directly assisting NGOs in these countries without agreement by the governments and the totalitarian nature of the political system."""" Two observations are in order with regard to this unusually candid and accurate characterization of political reality. One is the fact that these two countries--Syria and Tunisia--represent the opposite ends of the Barcelona process. Tunisia has for several years had an operational Association Agreement--indeed, it was the first """"partner"""" country to complete the process of signing and fully ratifying the agreement. With Syria, by contrast, there have been only several rounds of apparently inconsequential exploratory negotiations. Perhaps the process will accelerate under the rule of the new president Bashar al-Asad, but even so the expectation in all quarters is that Syria will be the last of the potential Euro-Mediterranean partners to sign and ratify an Association Agreement, probably not before 2010. The authoritarian character of the Syrian regime is long-established and well-recognized. What is remarkable, and what stands as an indictment of the Barcelona process as it pertains to human rights, is the fact that essentially the same characterization--in the words of the MEDA evaluators, """"totalitarian""""--applies also to the country that has committed itself, under Article 2 of the Association Agreement, to respect human rights and democratic freedoms, and that has emerged from ministerial-level association council meetings without sanction for its persecution and suppression of human rights defenders. The point is not that the situation of human rights defenders in Tunisia--where there is a narrow margin for operation--is equivalent to that in Syria--where persons who have identified themselves as human rights activists continue to serve long prison terms under horrific conditions. But the situation in Tunisia is without question bad enough to keep MEDA from having much operational impact in that country, and to provoke the rather devastating assessment of the MEDA evaluators. More to the point, human rights practices in Tunisia generally, and the situation of defenders in particular, remains as bad if not worse than when the Barcelona process was initiated, and several years of an operational Association Agreement has not produced any discernible improvement. We find a similar deterioration of conditions in Egypt. During a period of active negotiations over a draft Association Agreement, the government has become increasingly aggressive in its efforts to control and discredit organizations dedicated to monitoring and defending human rights. This period has witnessed raids on the offices of the Arab Program for Human Rights Activists; the arrest and detention of the head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR: the case against Hafiz Abu Sa'ada has yet to be formally closed); the arrest, detention, and forthcoming trial (at this writing scheduled for November 18, just a few days after the Marseilles summit) of Saad Eddin Ibrahim and his associates in the Ibn Khaldun Center; and promulgation (in May 1999) of a new Law on Civil Associations and Institutions (Law 153/99) that mandates unwarranted restrictions on the activities of non-governmental organizations, including human rights groups, and authorizes a high degree of government interference in their internal affairs. When that law was overturned by the Supreme Constitutional Court, apparently on procedural grounds, the EOHR was informed that its application to register under the existing law had been deferred """"upon a request from security officials."""" The situation in other Euro-Mediterranean partner countries also testifies to a serious gap between pronouncement and practice regarding human rights defenders, as indicated by these recent developments in the region:  On May 27, Algerian security forces detained Mohamed Smain, head of the Relizane office of the Algerian League for the Defense of Human Rights (LADDH) after he attempted to document evidence at a grave site connected with the case of the two former mayors implicated in mass killings in the area. He was released the next day but authorities confiscated his videotape of the site.    Rachid Mesli, an Algerian human rights lawyer who had been released from prison in July 1999 after serving all but a few days of a three year sentence on trumped up charges, was stopped at the airport and questioned in June after returning from a meeting in Geneva about the future of Algeria. Surveillance of his activities intensified and a prison acquaintance was reportedly tortured in an effort to elicit, among other things, damaging information about Mesli, leading him to fear that he would be arrested and returned to prison. Mesli left Algeria with his family in August and requested political asylum in Switzerland.    In the territories under Israeli military occupation, lawyers for Palestinian detainees frequently had difficulty gaining access to their clients, and closures often kept Palestinian human rights workers and lawyers from traveling freely within the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and Israel.    On August 8, Palestinian Authority Chief of Police Ghazi al-Jabali ordered LAW and its director, Khader Shkirat, banned from """"visiting prisons, detention centers, police command centers, and police locations"""" because of his """"continuous attacks on the [Palestinian] Authority."""" The order came one day after Shkirat was violently removed from the Ramallah Police Headquarters when he raised cases of police torture of detainees.    In Turkey criticism of the authorities or questioning the state's monolithic view of society is often viewed as a form of disloyalty bordering on treason. Over the past five years members of the Turkish Human Rights Association's (HRA) fifty-nine branches have been detained, tortured, imprisoned and subjected to death threats. HRA branches in Diyarbakir and Van have been frequently closed down by order of the Emergency Region governor, whose administrative decisions cannot be challenged in the courts.    In Morocco Capt. Mustafa Adib was convicted for a second time in an unfair military trial of """"insulting the royal armed forces"""" after he complained of corruption and racketeering among the high command at the air base where he was stationed.    In September the Jordanian Press association suspended Nidal Mansour, editor of Al-Hadath weekly, for accepting foreign funding for a local press freedom organization.     The serious and persistent government or government-sanctioned attacks on human rights defenders and interference in their work throughout the region constitutes a serious challenge to the Euro-Mediterranean project as it moves into its second five-year phase. The challenge is both to the governments that commit these abuses and to the governments that allow them to pass without consequence. European governments have invested a much greater effort into combating migration and denying asylum protection, for instance, than to addressing the human rights abuses that contribute to the outflow of migrants and asylum seekers.","",""

Looking abroad, the groups said that """"security and justice are mutually reinforcing goals that ultimately depend upon the promotion of all human rights for all people"""" and called on the United States to promote fundamental rights around the world and to ensure that other countries do not use the fight against terrorism as a pretext to justify repression. As the war in Afghanistan continues, the groups advocated for """"exceptional attention to protecting civilians and civilian objects from harm,"""" and """"safe access to humanitarian aid and security for humanitarian workers in order to provide the urgent assistance required by the millions of men, women and children inside Afghanistan."""" Groups making the recommendations include: the Alliance for Justice, Amnesty International USA, CARE, Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, Doctors of the World-USA, Human Rights Watch, Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, Muslim Public Affairs Council, National Council of Churches, Open Society Institute, Oxfam America, Physicians for Human Rights, Refugees International, Save the Children/US, Union of American Hebrew Congregations, and the US Committee for Refugees. The full statement and a complete list of signers is attached. STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES Following the appalling attacks of September 11, the United States and the international community face an historic challenge: to mount a collective effort to achieve security in a world scarred by atrocities and conflict. To meet this challenge we must recognize that security and justice are mutually reinforcing goals that ultimately depend upon the promotion of all human rights for all people. The principles established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights demand accountability for those who violate its fundamental principles. More than that, they offer a universal blueprint for just societies based on the values of liberty, equality, democracy, development, and justice. These principles are not the province of one civilization or culture but the shared birthright of all human beings.  We therefore propose ten core principles that should guide the response to these attacks, and to those responsible for them. Condemn the Attacks 1. We condemn the horrendous attacks of September 11. We urge all governments and all people to stand against these and other indiscriminate attacks directed at innocent civilians.  Mourn the Victims 2. We mourn the loss of innocent lives and express our solidarity with the victims and their families.  Bring the Perpetrators to Justice and Prevent New Attacks 3. We urge all governments to unite to investigate these crimes, to bring to justice those who are responsible, and to prevent future attacks.  Safeguard Liberty while Protecting Security  4. In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks the U.S. government has the authority and the duty to take every reasonable step to ensure security for everyone in the United States. Such steps can and must uphold the democratic freedoms cherished by citizens and non-citizens alike. We are confident that we can reconcile the requirements of security with the blessings of liberty.  Reject Scapegoating 5. We commend public officials and civic and religious leaders who have called on the public not to blame whole communities for the deeds of a few. These leaders and the public at large should continue to work to prevent attacks, harassment, and persecution of people based on their race, religion, national origin, ethnic background, or appearance. Hate crimes must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.  Promote and Respect Human Rights Worldwide 6. The United States and its allies should not allow the current campaign to prevent them from vigorously and consistently challenging violations of fundamental rights by all governments. They must ensure that governments do not use the fight against terrorism as a pretext to justify repression or the curtailment of rights. And of course they themselves must avoid support for or complicity in abuses. Respect the Laws of War 7. The military responses that have been or may be undertaken must pay exceptional attention to protecting civilians and civilian objects from harm as required by international humanitarian law such as the Geneva Conventions. Perpetrators and their accomplices must be distinguished from the civilian population at large and from those who may simply share their religion, ethnicity or national origin. Efforts should also be undertaken to minimize displacement of civilians. Ensure Humanitarian Access and Protect Those Seeking Refuge 8. Governments and other parties must ensure safe access to humanitarian aid and security for humanitarian workers in order to provide the urgent assistance required by the millions of men, women and children inside Afghanistan. Refugees and others in need of international protection must be allowed to leave Afghanistan or other countries to seek safety. Governments should work together to ensure that countries receiving refugees have the necessary resources to screen the arriving population and to provide them with the required standards of protection, food, water, shelter and other basic needs. Promote Human Development 9. Freedom from fear must go hand in hand with freedom from want. A key to security lies in safeguarding and promoting just and equitable societies where people's basic civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights are respected. Today, more than ever, our search for security must include an affirmative commitment to advance this broader rights agenda. Promote and Defend Open Societies 10. Global security is enhanced by the success of open societies that foster respect for the rule of law and promote tolerance and guarantee people's rights of free expression and peaceful dissent. We applaud political leaders, in the U.S. and elsewhere, who champion human rights and democratic government.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/31/letter-prime-minister-howard-recent-amendments-migration-act","Letter to Prime Minister Howard on Recent Amendments to the Migration Act","Letter to Prime Minister Howard on Recent Amendments to the Migration Act","","10/31/2001","The Honorable John Howard MG 8 Parliament House Canberra ACT 2600 Dear Prime Minister Howard: Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Committee for Refugees are concerned by the ways in which the recent amendments to Australia’s Migration Act of 1958 (the “Migration Act”) and other Australian legislation will severely affect the human rights of asylum seekers and refugees.  In particular, we are concerned that the new law prevents asylum seekers from accessing refugee determination procedures, narrows the definition of a refugee, broadens safe-third-country provisions, and increases detention of asylum seekers and refugees. The recent amendments to Australian law seriously infringe upon the right of refugees not to be returned to a country where their lives or freedom are threatened (the principle of nonrefoulement).  This principle is the cornerstone of international refugee protection and is enshrined in Article 33 of the Refugee Convention, which Australia has ratified.  It is also a well-established principle of international customary law. Accessing Determination Procedures and Refoulement The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) Act 2001 has designated Christmas Island, Ashmore Reef and Cartier Islands, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and Australian sea and resources installations as “excised offshore place[s]” deemed outside the country’s “migration zone.”  Under the law, persons who enter these offshore places are defined as “offshore entry persons” and are unable to make visa applications, including requests for asylum, unless the minister exercises his discretion on their behalf.  Asylum seekers who are not given authority to present their claims may be taken “to a place outside Australia” (pursuant to amendments to the Customs Act § 185(3A)), including to a country with a declaration in force regarding access to asylum procedures (pursuant to amendments to the Migration Act §198A).  Human Rights Watch and the U.S. Committee for Refugees were greatly disturbed by Australia’s decision on October 19, 2001 to return an Indonesian fishing vessel containing asylum seekers to international waters, in furtherance of the new law, after the vessel reached the “excised” Australian territory of Ashmore Reef.  This and subsequent similar actions indicate that the unfettered discretion afforded to the minister in the new legislation can be exercised in a manner that raises serious refoulement concerns. By permitting “offshore entry persons” to be excluded from Australia without access to asylum determinations, Australia undermines its obligation of nonrefoulement.  The obligation of nonrefoulement must be upheld in all of Australia’s territories, regardless of whether such actions take place within or outside of the “migration zone.” Until the law is amended to conform to international standards, ministerial discretion must be exercised to ensure that each refugee arriving in Australia (whether inside or outside the “migration zone”) is protected from direct or indirect return to a place where his or her life or freedom would be threatened.    Implementing the newly passed legislation in a manner that upholds all international legal obligations will also require providing access to full, fair and efficient determination procedures to asylum seekers arriving in all parts of Australia’s territory so that refugees can be identified and afforded protection against any manner of refoulement.  As you are aware, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides in Article 14 that “everyone has the right to seek and enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.”  This principle of international human rights is undermined, often together with the principle of nonrefoulement, when individuals are prevented from accessing fair and efficient asylum determination procedures. Narrowing the Definition of a Refugee The new legislation imposes limits on the definition of a refugee that contravene the text of the Refugee Convention, as well as the inclusive spirit in which the treaty was drafted.  The definition of a refugee, as indicated by the Convention’s travaux préparatoires, was intended to cover a broad range of persons who could not obtain the protection they required from their countries of origin. There was never any intention to single out a special set of individuals as more deserving of protection than others.  Unfortunately, this is precisely what the Australian amendments have done. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6), § 91R, adopts a definition of persecution that is narrower than Australia’s treaty obligations under the Refugee Convention.  The bill states that the Refugee Convention-based reasons for persecution do not apply “unless: (a) that reason is the essential and significant reason, or those reasons are the essential and significant reasons, for the persecution; and (b) the persecution involves serious harm to the person; and (c) the persecution involves systematic and discriminatory conduct.”  This new three-step approach to defining persecution is geared to past experience of persecution and does not embrace the forward-looking nature of the “well-founded fear of being persecuted” standard contained in Article 1(A) of the Refugee Convention. The Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 6) § 91S also requires that one member of a family hold a well-founded fear of persecution on Refugee Convention grounds before any other member of his family can be recognized to hold a well-founded fear of persecution for membership in a particular family grouping.  In practice, this double-requirement undermines the right of each asylum-seeker to have his or her application considered on its own terms.  For example, if a male member of a family presents his application first (and it is denied) and later his wife applies based on membership in a family unit, her family-based fear might be sufficient to satisfy Article 1(A) of the Convention, but his earlier denial could be used by an adjudicator to deny her application.   These alterations of the definition of a refugee contained in Australia’s legislation, we believe, must be amended or at the very least interpreted in a manner that complies with the full scope of the refugee definition and consequent Refugee Convention obligations. The legislation’s narrowing of the definition is a breach of Australia’s treaty obligations, and unless broadened through amendment or interpretation, could result in the refoulement of refugees. Safe Third Country Provisions The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 amends the Migration Regulations of 1994, which list the categories of individuals who may apply for visas, including refugees. As a result of the amendments, these Migration Regulations now contain, in Schedule 1, Part 4, a requirement that an asylum seeker applying for a visa has not resided “for a continuous period of at least 7 days, in a country in which the applicant could have sought and obtained effective protection: (a) of the country; or (b) through the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees located in that country.”  These requirements may be waived if the minister is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. These provisions are based on the false premise that international law requires asylum seekers to lodge an asylum application in the first country they reach.  In fact, the Refugee Convention does not specify where an asylum application should be made.  In addition, the new requirements make no allowance for refugees sur place, whose reasons for applying for asylum are based on circumstances that arise well after such a “continuous period of at least 7 days.”  Since these measures limit an individual’s right to seek asylum in violation of principles of international human rights and Australia’s Refugee Convention obligations, they should be deleted from the law.   Detention The Migration Amendment (Excision from Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001 § 189 allows potentially indefinite detention of all non-citizens and asylum seekers whom an officer “reasonably suspects” are “seeking to enter an excised offshore place.” Section 494AA of the Migration Act is amended to place a strict bar on judicial review when such detention occurs outside the “migration zone.”  Unless safeguards are put in place, detention under the amended Migration Act will violate the fundamental norm against prolonged arbitrary and unlawful detention --- which applies to all non-citizens, including refugees and asylum seekers. The right to liberty and security of person is guaranteed under the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Australia is a party.  Article 9 of the ICCPR provides that everyone “has the right to liberty and security of person.  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest or detention.”  To ensure freedom from arbitrary detention, Article 9 further requires that detention must be examined for its lawfulness by an impartial adjudicator.  The U.N. Human Rights Committee has expressly stated that the guarantees of Article 9 apply to aliens.  In July 2000 the committee specifically urged Australia to reconsider its mandatory detention policy for unauthorized arrivals, including asylum seekers, and to inform all detainees of their legal rights, including their right to seek legal counsel.  UNHCR guidelines on the detention of asylum seekers also stipulate that as a general rule asylum seekers should not be detained and minimal procedural safeguards must be guaranteed.  These include the right to an automatic independent judicial review of all decisions to detain followed by periodic reviews of the necessity to continue to detain, and the right of all asylum seekers to be informed of their right to legal counsel and to be provided free legal assistance where possible. The recent legislation seriously contravenes Australia’s obligations to non-citizens, refugees and asylum seekers under international human rights and refugee law.  As provided for in Article 2 of the ICCPR, the obligation to respect and ensure rights to all persons, including all non-citizens, applies throughout Australia’s territory and to all persons subject to Australia’s jurisdiction.  We urge Australia, as we have already urged the U.S. government in similar circumstances, to amend its new legislation or at a minimum to implement it in a manner that fully upholds fundamental norms of international human rights and refugee law.

None of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch knew of Taliban or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack.  Human Rights Watch reiterated its call to the U.S.-led alliance to ensure that it is taking adequate precautions to avoid civilian casualties, and called for an immediate investigation into the bombing raid that hit Chowkar-Karez, located some forty kilometers north of the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar.  """"If there were military targets in the area, we'd like to know what they were,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. """"This is the second instance in less than a week in which we've documented substantial civilian casualties from U.S. bombing raids. The Pentagon has got to do more to avoid these deaths.""""  Human Rights Watch researchers located six wounded survivors of the October 22 bombing raid that hit Chowkar-Karez. The six are currently recovering in Quetta hospitals. Human Rights Watch also interviewed several additional persons who witnessed the attack but were not hurt.  Among those wounded by the bombing are forty-year-old Sardar Bibi, who lost her husband and six children in the attack; five-year-old Shabir Ahmed, who received severe shrapnel wounds to his head and remains unconscious; Shabir Ahmed's seven-year-old brother, who was also wounded; and three adult sisters.  According to the highly consistent accounts of the survivors, the bombs came from several aircraft that flew over the village of Chowkar-Karez, which is located in the Buri-Kala area of Kandahar province, some forty kilometers north of the city of Kandahar. The attack began at about 11 p.m. on the night of Monday, October 22, 2001. Many of the people in the village then ran out of their homes, afraid that the bombs would fall on the homes. All witnesses stated that aircraft then returned to the area and began firing from guns. Many of the civilians were killed from the firing. The bombing and firing lasted for about one hour.  One family interviewed by Human Rights Watch provided the names of eighteen relatives killed in the incident, and another unrelated woman told Human Rights Watch that her husband and six children were killed, and that she had been told that as many as thirty-five people died in the raid.  All of the witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch were adamant that there were no Taliban or Al-Qaida positions in the area of the attack, which is in a remote rural area of Afghanistan. In almost all other cases of civilian casualties caused by the U.S.-led bombing campaign investigated by Human Rights Watch, survivors and witnesses have been forthcoming in identifying Taliban or Al-Qaida military positions located nearby which could have been the target of the attack. It is impossible for Human Rights Watch to verify independently whether Taliban or Al-Qaida military targets existed in the area of Chowkar-Karez village, but the consistent statements of all witnesses and survivors that there were none is notable.  Mushfeqa, aged twenty, was interviewed by Human Rights Watch in a Quetta hospital where she and two sisters were recovering from shrapnel wounds. She explained that she and her extended family had fled from the city of Kandahar to their rural homes in Chowkar-Karez when the U.S.-led bombing campaign began. Referring to October 22, she told Human Rights Watch, """"It was at about 11 p.m. First, one plane came and dropped a bomb. We ran out of the home, because we were afraid to die there. Then, some went back inside. I was at the door, and some of the small children were outside. Then the plane came and it was firing. I saw my mother and my brother shot. My uncle ran to his car to turn off the lights. Then a bomb hit the car and he died. ... When the next bomb came, I was inside the room. I was injured from the shrapnel.""""  Belqais, aged forty, a relative of Mushfeqa, confirmed to Human Rights Watch the deaths of her two brothers and many of their relatives. She named among the dead her eldest brother Noor Ahmed, aged fifty, his wife Masooma, aged thirty-five, and their four children, as well as her second brother, Saleh Ahmed, aged thirty-five, his wife Zarmina, and one of their sons. The two surviving sons of Saleh Ahmed, aged five and seven, are currently hospitalized in Quetta and were visited by Human Rights Watch. Belkais stated that other family members had also died.  Shafiqa, a sister of Mushfeqa who was also wounded in the attack, told Human Rights Watch that in total nineteen members of the extended family had died and provided a list of names which included the names provided by Belqais and Mushfeqa as well as others.  Another unrelated victim of the attack, located independently by Human Rights Watch, provided additional and confirming information of the incident. Sardar Bibi, aged about forty, is currently recovering in another hospital in Quetta. She told Human Rights Watch, """"I was wounded five days ago. It was at night, at about 11:30 or so, I don't know the exact time as we were sleeping. Suddenly the bombardment started. We went out of the house because we were afraid they would bombard the house. Then, we were running with our neighbors. Another bomb fell down. ...The plane was circling and also shooting. First, a plane came and dropped a bomb, but the other plane kept circling."""" Her husband, Daulat Khan, and all of her six children were killed during the attack. Her children included two one-and-one-half-year-old twins, Mohammed Yasin and Mohammed Yusof, fourteen-year-old Akhter Bibi, fifteen-year-old Najia, sixteen-year-old Maimana, and eighteen-year-old Mariam.  She confirmed that there had been many civilian casualties in the village, and gave a similar death toll from one family as that given by the family interviewed by Human Rights Watch (see above): """"Many people died and many were wounded.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/30/questions-and-answers-regarding-perus-criminal-prosecution-fujimori","Questions and Answers Regarding Perus Criminal Prosecution of Fujimori","Questions and Answers Regarding Peru's Criminal Prosecution of Fujimori","","10/30/2001","Q.What are the charges against Fujimori, and on what incidents are they based?   On September 5, Peruvian Attorney General Nelly Calderón formally accused former president Alberto K. Fujimori of murder, causing grave injuries, and """"disappearances."""" The criminal charges against Fujimori were filed in the wake of the unanimous August 27 decision of the Peruvian Congress to lift his immunity as former head of state. On September 13, Supreme Court Justice José Luis Lecaros issued an international warrant to Interpol for the arrest of Fujimori, who is now residing in Japan.   Fujimori is accused of responsibility in the extrajudicial execution in 1991 of fifteen people, including a child, at a fund-raising party in a poor tenement in Lima's Barrios Altos district, and the """"disappearance"""" in 1992 of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University. Members of the Colina Group, a paramilitary death squad, were directly responsible for both crimes, acting in the Cantuta case with the support of regular army units. The Colina Group answered to Vladimiro Montesinos, presidential advisor and de facto head of the National Intelligence Service (SIN), who is currently detained and facing trial on corruption and human rights charges. Montesinos was Fujimori's closest confidante throughout his government.   Enforced disappearance has been a crime in Peru since 1991. Law No. 26926 of February 21, 1998 incorporated it into the Criminal Code as a crime against humanity. The criminal code's definition of crime against humanity differs, however, from the international law definition of crimes against humanity. Q. What is the evidence against Fujimori?    The accusation cites evidence that Fujimori, acting in concert with Montesinos, exercised command control over the Colina Group. The charges allege that the group could not have committed crimes of this magnitude without Fujimori's express orders or consent. The charges also state that the formation and functioning of the Colina group was part of an overall counter-insurgency policy that involved systematic violations of human rights.   Testimonies showing Fujimori's command responsibility include those of several members of the Colina group currently facing trial, relatives of former members of the group, two former commanders of the Peruvian army and a top former army general.   Since the La Cantuta operation involved the deployment of regular army units as well as the clandestine action of the death squad, only Fujimori as Supreme Commander of the armed forces, as well as legal head of the SIN, had the power of command to authorize it, the accusation claims. It also alleges that Fujimori covered up the crimes by promising to grant members of the death squad protection from prosecution, and that he rewarded them afterwards.   Indeed, Fujimori refused to allow Colina members to testify before a congressional committee investigating the crimes, and further protected them by having a law passed to ensure that a military court retained jurisdiction over the case. Finally, under pressure from the executive branch, Congress approved a comprehensive amnesty in 1995. Those of the group in detention at that time were immediately released, and the charges against them were dropped.   This past March, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled that the application of the amnesty in the Barrios Altos case was incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights, and without legal effect. In response to the ruling, the Peruvian government asked the Court to clarify whether it was applicable to other cases. In September, the Court ruled that the application of the amnesty to any of the grave human rights crimes committed during Peru's counter-insurgency effort would violate the American Convention. In October, the Supreme Council of Military Justice, the Peru's highest military court, annulled its 1995 decision applying the amnesty laws to the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta cases, removing the last legal obstacle to Fujimori's trial in Peru.   Q.What are the next steps in the case against Fujimori?   Under Peruvian law, accusations against the president, ministers, members of congress and Supreme Court justices must be adjudicated by the Supreme Court. Although Fujimori is no longer president, he was head of state when the crimes were committed, and therefore he is covered by this rule. The court's most junior member, Justice José Luis Lecaros, is leading the investigation of the Fujimori case. If the Japanese authorities agree to take Fujimori into custody, Justice Lecaros would have thirty days in which to request his extradition.   Q. Why is Fujimori's extradition important?   Peru's legal system does not allow trials in absentia. If he is not extradited, Fujimori will almost certainly escape prosecution, unless he is tried in Japan. Moreover, there may not be any provision under Japanese law for trying a person for human rights crimes committed on another country's territory.   If Japan decides neither to extradite nor try Fujimori, he will enjoy complete impunity while he remains in Japan.   Q. What is the Japanese government's position on extraditing Fujimori?   After attending a summit in Brunei in November 2000, Fujimori went to Japan and resigned from the Peruvian presidency. The Japanese authorities recognized his claim to Japanese nationality and he is currently living in Tokyo as a Japanese citizen. When the Peruvian government pressed charges against Fujimori for abandoning his office, Japan declared that it would not extradite him.   Japanese law prohibits the extradition of Japanese nationals. Moreover, Japan and Peru do not have an extradition treaty.   To obtain Fujimori's extradition on the charges approved by the Peruvian Congress on August 27, Peru could claim that Fujimori's Peruvian nationality, on the basis of which he held office as head of state, has preeminence over his Japanese nationality. Eventually, with the consent of Japan, this issue could be settled by the arbitration of an international court.   Q. Fujimori claims to be a victim of a political witch-hunt. Is there any truth to this claim?   Feelings against Fujimori undoubtedly run high in Peru. This does not disqualify a trial, however, provided that the charges against him are well founded and the court trying him is independent and impartial in its decisions.   There are sufficient grounds for former President Fujimori to be required to answer in court regarding the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta crimes. If extradited to Peru, Fujimori would be tried by the Permanent Criminal Chamber (Sala Permanente Penal) of the Supreme Court, composed of three judges meeting in oral session. The question of his criminal responsibility is a matter for the court to decide after a careful consideration of the evidence. Fujimori could name his legal representation and would enjoy rights to appeal to a separate court, in this case another chamber of the Supreme Court, with different judges.","Americas, Peru, Japan","International Justice"

The four international human rights organizations urged his immediate and unconditional release.  On 31 October Cairo Juvenile Court will hear the appeal case of 16-year-old Mahmud. He was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment on 18 September following his arrest in May for alleged homosexual behaviour. During the initial two weeks of detention he was denied the fundamental right to meet his family or be seen by a lawyer. Confessions extracted from Mahmud during that period were used as evidence in a trial leading to his conviction. His lawyer claims that these confessions were extracted under pressure and they were later withdrawn.  “We are extremely concerned about the conviction and harsh sentencing of a child for his alleged sexual orientation,” Amnesty International, Defence for Children International, Human Rights Watch and International Federation for Human Rights said today. The organizations said that disregard for basic safeguards in detention is extremely dangerous and, put Mahmud at serious risk of human rights violations.  “We are seriously concerned that this child was interrogated in violation of international standards. Such confessions should not have been allowed as evidence before the court.“  According to Article 37 (d) of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Egypt is a State Party: “Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance ...”.  The case of Mahmud is related to the trial of 52 alleged gay men on charges of """"obscene behaviour"""". They are being tried before an exceptional court - based on the emergency legislation - which does not allow for the right to an appeal in violation of international human rights law. The men reported during sessions at the State Security Prosecution Office in May that they had been subjected to torture and ill treatment during pre-trial detention, in particular during the first days after their arrest. No thorough and impartial investigation is known to have been conducted into these allegations.  Amnesty International, Defence for Children International, Human Rights Watch and International Federation for Human Rights have sent a trial observer to Egypt who will attend the hearing before Cairo Juvenile Court on 31 October 2001.  BACKGROUND Mahmud was reportedly arrested on 10 May at about 11pm on Ramsis Street in the center of Cairo. He was first held at al-Azbekiya police station, before being transferred to the State Security Intelligence Department in the Misr al-Gadida district of Cairo. There he was questioned in connection with investigations against a group of more than 50 other detainees suspected of consensual sexual activities with persons of the same sex. On 12 May Mahmud and the others were brought before the State Security Prosecution that ordered their detention pending investigations. For more than four months Mahmud was detained at Tora Prison together with adults. Following his conviction on 18 September he was transferred to a Juvenile Punitive Institution in al-Marg near Cairo.  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) provides clear guidelines for the protection of children in detention. Article 37 (c):  “Every child deprived of liberty shall be treated with humanity and respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, and in a manner which takes into account the needs of persons of his or her age. In particular, every child deprived of liberty shall be separated from adults unless it is considered in the child’s best interest not to do so ...”.  International standards give clear guidelines for proceedings in connection with juveniles in pre-trial detention. According to Article 37 (d) of the CRC:  “Every child deprived of his or her liberty shall have the right to prompt access to legal and other appropriate assistance, as well as the right to challenge the legality of the deprivation of his or her liberty before a court or other competent, independent and impartial authority, and to a prompt decision on any such action.”  According to Article 15 of the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice (“The Beijing Rules”):  “(15.2.) The parents or the guardian shall be entitled to participate in the proceedings and may be required by the competent authority to attend them in the interest of the juvenile...”.  Article 40.2 b (iv) of the CRC stipulates that no child shall “be compelled to give testimony or to confess guilt”.  Mahmud spent over four months in pre-trial detention, although Article 37 (b) of the CRC stresses that deprivation of the liberty of a child should “be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time”. Similar provisions are included in the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice and the UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty.  On 18 July 2001 the Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanours opened trial against 52 alleged gay men. This is an exceptional court based on emergency legislation, which does not allow for the right to appeal in violation of international human rights law. All defendants are charged with “obscene behaviour” and two are facing additional charges of expressing “contempt for religion”. The verdict in this case has been scheduled for 14 November 2001. (For further background on this case please refer to previous statements: Amnesty International: Egypt: Concerns over detention of alleged gays, 8 June 2001, AI Index: MDE 12/015/2001; Human Rights Watch: Egypt: Emergency Court Trials for Homosexuality Suspects, 4 July 2001).

Milosevic was originally charged only for crimes committed in Kosovo. The new indictment covers the 1991-1992 conflict in Croatia, and additional charges covering the Bosnia conflict are expected in the coming weeks.  The indictment charges Milosevic with multiple counts of murder, torture, detention, deportation and other atrocities allegedly committed during the attempted ethnic cleansing of Croatia from 1991 to 1992.  """"Finally, Milosevic will be held to account for crimes committed long before the Kosovo war,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"Had it been possible to bring these charges several years ago, perhaps some of the horrors of the Balkan wars could have been averted.""""  Croatia proclaimed its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. Milosevic, who was President of Serbia at the time, had control over Serb forces that tried to assert control and eliminate non-Serbs from one-third of Croatian territory. In the process, Serb forces murdered or forcibly removed virtually all non-Serbs living there-nearly a quarter of a million people. Human Rights Watch, which first investigated those crimes in 1992, found that civilians accounted for half of those killed.  Included in the new indictment are allegations about the removal of 255 Croat civilians and disabled combatants from Vukovar hospital and their subsequent torture and mass execution. Also included is the 1991 attack on the city of Dubrovnik, a recognized World Cultural Heritage Site.  The indictment accuses Milosevic of participating in a """"joint criminal enterprise"""" whose purpose was the ethnic cleansing of the invaded areas. Fifteen other individuals - none of whom have been arrested - are listed as co-perpetrators. In addition, the indictment holds Milosevic criminally responsible for the crimes committed by his subordinates on the basis of command responsibility. The prosecutor charges that Serbian and Yugoslav forces fighting in Croatia were subject to Milosevic's control during this period. The prosecution must prove that he knew or should have known of the acts being carried out and took no steps to prevent them.  Charges of sexual violence are included in the thirty-two counts of persecution, torture and inhumane treatment. These acts were allegedly perpetrated by Serb forces against Croat and other non-Serb civilians during their arrest and detention.  """"This indictment reaffirms that sexual violence against women during armed conflict can constitute a war crime and a crime against humanity,"""" said Dicker. """"And that responsibility for such crimes can rest at the highest levels."""" Human Rights Watch has pressed The Hague Tribunal to continue investigating and prosecuting crimes of sexual violence committed in the Balkan conflicts.  Milosevic is already in detention awaiting trial before the tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in 1999. A new Human Rights Watch report was released on October 26 in Pristina. """"Under Orders"""" fully documents the systematic crimes committed by Serb forces during the Kosovo conflict, as well as abuses committed by the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army.  Today the court is also scheduled to hear a motion arguing for Mr. Milosevic's release. The motion was prepared by three lawyers appointed to assist the court in ensuring a fair trial after Milosevic insisted on representing himself. The motion challenges the manner of his arrest and the Tribunal's legitimacy.  The Tribunal was created in 1993 by U.N. Security Council Resolution 827, under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which authorizes the Security Council to determine when a threat to international peace exists and to respond accordingly.

In a new report released today, Human Rights Watch documents the catastrophic assault on women's human rights during a decade of conflict in Afghanistan, and under the repressive rule of the Taliban. The 27-page report, """"Humanity Denied: Systematic Violations of Women's Rights in Afghanistan,"""" urges the international community to protect women's rights during the conflict and include full respect and protection for women's human rights as an integral part of any post-conflict reconstruction in Afghanistan.  """"Women have borne the lion's share of human rights abuses in Afghanistan throughout the conflict, and they are in particular danger now,"""" said LaShawn R. Jefferson, executive director of the women's rights division of Human Rights Watch. """"Any future political arrangements in Afghanistan have to take special account of what women have suffered - and how that can be remedied.""""  The Taliban's restrictions on women's movement, dress, and association may be preventing women from fleeing for safety or getting access to humanitarian aid, Human Rights Watch said. Women are forced to wear a chadari, a head-to-toe enveloping garment that literally makes it difficult for them to move quickly. Since women are not allowed to travel outside the home without a close male relative, widows and women who head households face a particularly serious humanitarian crisis. Both Taliban forces and forces now grouped in the United Front have sexually assaulted, abducted, and forcibly married women during the armed conflict, targeting them on the basis of both gender and ethnicity. Thousands of women have been physically assaulted and have had severe restrictions placed on their liberty and fundamental freedoms.  """"The Taliban have sought to erase women from public life through widespread discrimination. They punish women with public beatings,"""" said Jefferson. """"Any political solution in Afghanistan must not bargain away accountability for this systematic violence and discrimination.""""  Human Rights Watch called on all parties to the conflict to commit to respect international human rights and humanitarian law and to investigate and hold accountable personnel responsible for violations. The international monitoring organization urged the Taliban and the United Front to cease violations of humanitarian law, in particular gender-specific violations against women, and urged the donor community to ensure the inclusion of women both as recipients of aid and as equal partners in decision making regarding development and aid projects in Afghanistan.  The following are testimonials from the report """"Humanity Denied: Systematic Violations of Women's Rights in Afghanistan:""""  Zafia Akil, a widow who worked as a seamstress in Kabul:  The Taliban asked my customers, """"Why are you going to her house. Are you going to gather and make plans against us?"""" I had a board outside which read, """"Tailoring for women and children."""" Three times they came and warned me, and I told them, """"I am a widow, what should I do?"""" The third time they took my board down and said that if I do not stop this work they will kill me. They accused me of making plans against the Taliban. They said, """"Everyone should sew their own clothes; our wives sew their own clothes.

One of them beat the driver with a yellow cable that was pretty wide. I was scared. He asked me why the holes in my chadari were so big? Why are you alone in the taxi? I asked, """"Are you going to beat me?"""" I put my child away in the car and told them, """"Beat me, but do not hurt the child."""" He beat me. I hid my face.

Human Rights Watch also called on the Pakistani government to halt the establishment of camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of the North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) - known as the """"tribal areas.""""  """"The security of refugees cannot be guaranteed in either of these areas,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director at Human Rights Watch.

By turning away refugees at the border and deporting those who have already crossed and sending them to camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan would be violating fundamental international obligations not to return refugees to a country where their lives are threatened, Human Rights Watch said. The Taliban have attacked humanitarian agencies and confiscated food supplies in recent weeks (see Human Rights Watch press release - Afghanistan: Attacks on Aid Increasing), leading to serious concerns about the security of refugees and access to adequate humanitarian assistance if camps were established under Taliban control.  Hostility towards refugees and aid workers in the so-called tribal areas of Pakistan is already high and may increase with a further influx of refugees, making it difficult for relief agencies to operate, Human Rights Watch warned. United Nations and non-governmental relief agencies have already been subjected to harassment and attacks in the course of preparing and constructing these camps. The camps are also dangerously close to the border with Afghanistan, in violation of international standards that stipulate that camps should be located at a """"safe distance"""" from international borders.

Ben Barka was intercepted by French policemen on a Paris street October 29, 1965, driven away in a police vehicle and never seen again. Moroccan officials were long suspected of engineering the operation, though none was ever punished for the crime. French officials were suspected of complicity in the abduction, while recent revelations by a retired Moroccan police agent suggest that agents of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency were at the very least intimately aware of the plot as it was being prepared and carried out.  The mystery surrounding the fate of Ben Barka, a major figure in Moroccan politics and in the Third World movement internationally, continues to loom large in Morocco. Important actors in civil society are demanding truth and accountability with respect to the savage repression practiced by the government against dissidents during the 1960s and 1970s.  In response to a request made under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act in 1976, the Central Intelligence Agency acknowledged possession of more than 1,800 documents pertaining to Ben Barka but refused to release them. In today’s letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Human Rights Watch and the International Federation of Human Rights stated that a new request to declassify the documents would be filed in coming days.  Today’s letter to French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin (also available in English here), signed by Human Rights Watch, the International Federation of Human Rights, and the French League for Human Rights, endorsed a recent request by a French judge in charge of investigating Ben Barka’s disappearance that the French government release all documents pertaining to the affair.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, France, Morocco/Western Sahara",""

Human Rights Watch urged the U.S.-led alliance to ensure that it is taking adequate precautions to avoid civilian casualties, and launch an immediate investigation into the bombing raid that hit Thori village.  """"The Pentagon has to find out how this tragedy took place,"""" said Sidney Jones, Executive Director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The findings of its investigation should be made public.""""  Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed several of the survivors from Thori who are currently recovering in a hospital in Quetta.  According to the consistent and detailed accounts given by the survivors, U.S. warplanes began bombing the area around the remote Thori village, located in the Urozgan province of Afghanistan, at about 7:30 p.m. on the evening of October 21, 2001. The apparent target of the attack was a large Taliban military base known as Gar Mao located a kilometer or so from the village, which held ammunition depots and a defunct military prison, as well as Taliban military personnel. The survivors reported that bombing raids struck the village three times, beginning at 10 p.m. on October 21 and ending at about 1 a.m. the next morning.  Maroof, aged thirty-eight, lived at his farm located about one kilometer from the village and told Human Rights Watch that he had witnessed the attacks, first on the Taliban military base, and then on the nearby village, from his home. When he rushed to the village the next day, he found the family compound of his relatives in ruins, and villagers digging through the rubble. Twelve bodies of his relatives were recovered from the debris of the family compound. The dead included the two sons and two daughters of his twenty-five-year-old sister Rhidi Gul: Aminullah, aged eight; Raminullah, aged three; Noorjan, aged five; and Gulpia, aged four. Rhidi Gul was recovering from serious wounds at the Quetta hospital, unable to speak from her wounds, together with her surviving one-year-old son Hamidullah, also seriously wounded in the attack. Khamno, a ten-year old sister-in-law of Rhidi Gul, also survived the attack and was recovering from serious shrapnel wounds to the face in the Quetta hospital.  Also killed were three of his brothers-in-law: Abdul Ghani, aged twenty-five; Fazliullah, aged fifteen; Mohammed Rahim, aged four; and one sister-in-law: Sherina, aged twelve or thirteen. Another sister-in-law, fifteen-year-old Zarjana, died at the Chinai Hospital in Kandahar as doctors attempted to remove a piece of shrapnel from her body. Three other relatives were also killed: the twenty-year-old wife of his brother-in-law Abdul Ghani and her three-year-old daughter Mohtarama, as well as forty-five-year-old Bobo, the mother of Abdul Ghani.  Twenty-five-year-old Samiullah was outside the village when the bombing raids began, and rushed home to rescue his family. When he arrived at his family compound, he found the bodies of his twenty-year-old wife and three of his children: Mohibullah, aged six; Harifullah, aged three; and Bibi Aysha, aged one. He refused to name several female victims on religious grounds. As he was recovering their bodies, the bombing raids resumed, and he himself was wounded in the attacks.  Also killed were his two brothers, Nasiullah, aged eight, and Ghaziullah, aged six, as well as two of his sisters, aged fourteen and eleven. Three cousins, all siblings, also died: Ahmed Wali, aged six; Nabiullah, aged 3; and their eight-month old sister. A fourth cousin whom he was unable to identify died during the grueling seven-hour trip on a farm truck to the hospital in Kandahar.  Several additional survivors from Thori were also in the Quetta hospital, recovering from their wounds. Twenty-year-old Faisal Rahim rushed to help the wounded in Thori, and was himself wounded when the bombing resumed and a wall collapsed on his leg. Another young man at the Quetta hospital who wanted to remain anonymous was seriously wounded in the foot by shrapnel.  Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. and its allies in the current campaign to provide and evaluate information on civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects. In addition, it said they should regularly examine target and weapons selection, and take whatever corrective measures may be necessary to minimize the effects on civilians.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""

We are also very concerned by the recent decision to locate camps inside Afghanistan in collaboration with Taliban authorities.  Afghan refugees are fleeing human rights violations, armed conflict and attendant violations of international humanitarian law and civil unrest. The rapidly deteriorating humanitarian situation in Afghanistan fueled by drought, constraints on humanitarian assistance and the onset of winter are also driving people from their homes.  We are aware of the immense difficulties Pakistan faces in trying to cope with these new arrivals from Afghanistan and appreciate the heavy burden your country has borne over the last two decades in hosting millions of refugees, often with insufficient support from the international community. But we are concerned that the proposed camps may place the health and safety of new arrivals at risk.  We welcome the allocation of sites for camps near Chaman, some of which have been identified by UNHCR as being secure and viable now that a safe access road has been cleared and water sources are nearing completion.  Location of camps inside Afghanistan We are, however, deeply concerned by the recent decision to locate camps inside Afghanistan instead of allowing refugees to seek safety within Pakistan. The establishment of camps in Taliban controlled areas raises serious concerns about the security of refugees as well as access to humanitarian assistance. In particular, we are alarmed by reports of attacks by the Taliban on humanitarian agencies and staff in Afghanistan over recent weeks and fear that the security and protection of Afghan civilians could not be guaranteed in camps under Taliban control. Refugees are also vulnerable to politically or ethnically motivated attacks or forced conscription in camps located inside Afghanistan.  Turning away refugees at the border or deporting those who have already crossed and sending them to camps in Afghanistan where their safety cannot be guaranteed, is contrary to international law. In both scenarios, Pakistan is effectively returning Afghans to a country where their lives are seriously at risk. This violates the well-established principle of customary international law that no refugee may be returned (or """"refouled"""") to a place where his or her life is threatened. In addition, when turning individuals away at the border, Pakistan is impeding the fundamental right of all individuals to seek asylum as articulated in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  We urge Pakistan to reconsider its decision to establish camps inside Afghanistan and instead to allow all refugees to enter Pakistan, at least on a temporary basis, where their safety can be more readily assured.  Location of camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of the North West Frontier Province  In addition, we have several concerns about the proposed location of the camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of the NWFP. The suggested sites are isolated and lack adequate water supplies. Their location, dangerously close to the Afghan border, could compromise the security of refugees and humanitarian workers and impede relief efforts. International standards require that camps be located at a safe distance from international borders.  We understand that the camps will be guarded and that access for humanitarian agencies may be restricted. As you are aware, international refugee protection standards prohibit refugees being held under detention-like conditions. We are also concerned that hostility to refugees and aid workers by elements within the local population is already high in some places and may increase in the event of any mass influx, making it even more dangerous and difficult for relief agencies to operate safely in these areas. Our concerns have been reinforced by reports that United Nations and NGO relief agencies have already been subject to harassment in the course of the preparation and construction of these camps  We respectfully urge your government to halt current plans to establish camps in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of the NWFP and instead to identify alternative sites where the protection of refugees and humanitarian workers can be guaranteed. Camps should be located in areas with adequate infrastructure and water supply and humanitarian workers should have full, free and unimpeded access to the camps. Such camps should be established as a matter of urgency in order to prepare for new refugee flows.  Open borders and separation of armed and militant elements We also urge you to open Pakistan's borders with Afghanistan, working with appropriate agencies to develop a mechanism for separating and disarming armed and militant elements from the civilian refugees at the border in a way that both protects the refugees and guarantees Pakistan's security. Because of the border closures, thousands of refugees have been forced to pay exorbitant prices to smugglers in order to reach Pakistan and are endangering their lives in the process.  Again, we appreciate the assistance your government is already providing to refugees, and recognize your resource and security concerns. We believe, however, that those concerns can be balanced with refugee protection. Rest assured that we will be doing all we can to press for additional humanitarian assistance for Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

The 593-page report released today, """"Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo,"""" uses innovative statistical methods and comprehensive field research to document the torture, killings, rapes, and forced expulsions committed by forces under Milosevic's command against Kosovar Albanians between March 24 and June 12, 1999, the period of NATO's air campaign against Yugoslavia. More than 600 victims and witnesses of atrocities were interviewed for the report.     """"This report implicates the former leadership of Serbia and Yugoslavia in numerous atrocities,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The 1999 Kosovo campaign was clearly coordinated from the top, and some of these people still hold important positions today.""""     War crimes committed by Serbian and Yugoslav security forces did not occur in isolation, the Human Rights Watch report says. Three chapters of the report document abuses committed by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which abducted and murdered civilians during and after the war, as well as violations by NATO, which failed to minimize civilian casualties during its bombing of Yugoslavia. A background chapter analyzes Kosovo's recent history and the international community's failure to stop what is dubbed a """"predictable conflict.""""     """"For a decade the international community tolerated human rights abuses in Kosovo in the name of regional stability,"""" Andersen said. """"This report stresses the importance of promoting human rights before a conflict erupts, as well as accountability for past abuses to halt the cycle of violence.""""     """"Under Orders"""" breaks new ground in the depth and breadth of its documentation, including detailed case studies of dozens of villages, a statistical analysis of the abuses, photographs of perpetrators, a strategic overview of the Belgrade government's offensive, and the organizational structure of the Serbian police and Yugoslav army, both controlled by Milosevic.     A statistical analysis of executions in Kosovo, prepared in collaboration with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), reveals the coordinated nature of the offensive. Three distinct waves of killings suggest the executions were not the result of random violence by government forces. Rather, """"they were carefully planned and implemented operations that fit into the [Belgrade] government's strategic aims,"""" the report concludes.     Witness and survivor testimonies in village after village describe how Serbian and Yugoslav troops systematically burned homes, looted businesses, expelled civilians, and murdered those suspected of participating in or harboring the KLA, including some women and children. At some sites, witnesses reported that bodies were removed to conceal the crimes. This cover-up was apparently confirmed in 2001, when seven mass graves were discovered in Serbia proper containing the bodies of Kosovar Albanians.     Rape and sexual violence were also components of the campaign, the report says, used to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and push people to flee their homes. Human Rights Watch documented ninety-six cases of rape and sexual assault in Kosovo, although the total number of sexual assaults is certainly much higher. Human Rights Watch has urged the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to include rape charges in the indictment against Milosevic.     A chapter entitled """"Forces of the Conflict"""" details the various government troops involved in the conflict, as well as key members of the KLA. Important commanders in the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army, all listed in organizational diagrams, include:    Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, former Chief of the Yugoslav Army General Staff      Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, former head of the Yugoslav Army's Third Army      Maj. Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic, former head of the Third Army's Pristina Corps      Vlajko Stojiljkovic, former Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs      Col. Gen. Radomir Markovic, former head of Serbia's state security service (SDB)      Col. Sreten Lukic, former head of Serbian police in Kosovo      Col. Gen. Vlastimir Djordjevic, former head of Serbia's public security service (RJB)      Lt. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic, former head of Serbia's police department   Despite his direct involvement in the 1999 campaign, Nebojsa Pavkovic is currently chief of the Yugoslav Army General Staff. Sreten Lukic is currently chief of public security in the Serbian police. Ojdanic and Stojiljkovic, both indicted by the ICTY for crimes in Kosovo, are still at large, as are two other Kosovo-related indictees, Nikola Sainovic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister, and Milan Milutinovic, still the President of Serbia.     The report also documents violations by NATO and the KLA. NATO bombs killed approximately 500 Yugoslav civilians between March and June 1999, and NATO did not take adequate steps to minimize this number, the report concludes. NATO's use of cluster bombs, although halted in the course of the conflict, is also criticized in the report.     Human Rights Watch also charged the KLA with committing serious abuses in 1998, in the course of fighting that led up to the NATO bombing. KLA abuses during this period included abductions and murders of Serbs and ethnic Albanians considered collaborators with the state. Elements of the KLA are also responsible for post-conflict attacks on Serbs, Roma, and other non-Albanians, as well as ethnic Albanian political rivals.     As many as one thousand Serbs and Roma have been murdered or have gone missing since NATO bombing ceased on June 12, 1999. Criminal gangs or vengeful individuals may have been involved in some incidents since the war, but KLA members are clearly responsible for many of these crimes. By late-2000 more than 210,000 Serbs had fled Kosovo; most of them left in the first six weeks of the NATO deployment. Those who remain are concentrated in mono-ethnic enclaves.     The international community's slow response after the bombing campaign is partially to blame for the post-war violence, the report concludes. The United Nations and NATO failed to take decisive action from the outset to curb the forced displacement and killings of Kosovo's non-ethnic Albanian population, which set a precedent for the post-war period. Two years after the war, a functioning judiciary system has not been established and an atmosphere of impunity persists.     The report welcomes Milosevic's April 2001 arrest and his subsequent transfer to the ICTY. But Human Rights Watch urged further action by the Serbian authorities and the international community to hold accountable all those responsible for crimes committed during the war in Kosovo, as well as during the wars in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.     """"Holding Milosevic accountable is a first step,"""" Andersen said. """"But he is only one on a long list.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The report, released today, candidly described violations of religious freedom around the world, but failed to designate Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, and Turkmenistan as """"Countries of Particular Concern.""""  """"Clearly, the Administration doesn't want to offend key allies in the coalition through excessive truth-telling,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"The irony is that getting too close to countries that crush religious freedom may be more dangerous for America right now than keeping its distance-particularly when the religion being crushed is Islam.""""  Among those countries not named is Uzbekistan, where several thousand non-violent Muslims have been arrested in the last three years for practicing their faith outside state controls. Uzbekistan is hosting U.S. forces involved in operations in Afghanistan.  The State Department report acknowledges that the Uzbek government has committed """"abuses against many devout Muslims for their religious beliefs"""" - arresting people for proselytizing, for private teaching of religious principles, for wearing of religious clothing in public, and for distributing religious literature. It also acknowledges that authorities systematically torture religious prisoners.  """"By not designating Uzbekistan a 'Country of Particular Concern,' the Administration missed an easy opportunity to show that the war on terrorism cannot be a campaign against Islam,"""" Malinowski said.  Saudi Arabia was not designated, although, as State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said today, """"there is essentially no religious freedom"""" there. Christians working in the country are forbidden to conduct any form of public worship. The country's Shi`a Muslim minority faces severe discrimination. Conservative Sunni clerics associated with the government have publicly denigrated Shi`a as """"apostates"""" and """"non-believers"""" because some of their religious practices are at odds with the strict Wahhabi doctrine imposed by the country's rulers. In few countries in the world is the denial of religious freedom so integral to the self-conception and ethos of the government.  Also not designated was Turkmenistan, which suppresses all forms of religious practice other than state-sanctioned Islam and Russian orthodoxy. Hundreds of Protestants, followers of Hare Krishna and other minority religions have been harassed, questioned by police, and threatened with arrest for exercising their religious convictions. Turkmenistan is the only state in the former Soviet Union where authorities have confiscated and destroyed houses of worship (Seventh Day Adventist, Hare Krishna, and Muslim).  China was designated a """"Country of Particular Concern,"""" and the report's analysis of abuses of religious freedom is generally accurate, with one exception: The reporting on Xinjiang, the mainly-Muslim region of northwest China, is strikingly less critical than last year's. The government's """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign, launched nationwide in April 2001, has led to many arbitrary arrests and summary executions in Xinjiang. Separatism and religion appear to be as much the targets as ordinary crime. Under """"Strike Hard,"""" people have been arrested, for example, for having """"illegal religious publications"""" in their possession. Last year's State Department report accurately described a """"harsh crackdown on Uighur Muslims...that failed to distinguish between those involved with illegal religious activities and those involved in ethnic separatism or terrorist activities."""" Today's report, by contrast, merely notes that """"government sensitivity to Muslim community concerns is varied...and (in areas where there has been violence attributed to separatists) police crackdown on Muslim religious activity and places of worship accused of supporting separatism"""" in Xinjiang. The """"Strike Hard"""" campaign isn't even mentioned.  Also designated were Burma, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and the Taliban. Under the International Religious Freedom Act, when a country is named to this list, the Secretary of State must choose from an optional menu of steps, from diplomatic pressure to the imposition of sanctions. Most of the designated governments, however, are already subject to U.S. sanctions.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/25/nigeria-soldiers-massacre-civilians-revenge-attack-benue-state","Nigeria- Soldiers Massacre Civilians in Revenge Attack in Benue State","Nigeria: Soldiers Massacre Civilians in Revenge Attack in Benue State","","10/25/2001","(New York, October 25, 2001) - Human Rights Watch today condemned the massacre of more than 100 civilians by Nigerian soldiers in several villages in Benue State, apparently carried out as revenge for the killing of 19 soldiers earlier this month. Human Rights Watch urged President Olusegun Obasanjo to set up an independent investigation into the military operation in Benue since October 22 and to bring to justice those found responsible.  “The security forces have a duty to protect, not to attack, the population,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “The murder of the 19 soldiers should certainly be condemned, but their deaths do not justify the slaughter of civilians by the Nigerian army.”  Militia of the Tiv ethnic group are believed to have been responsible for the abduction and murder of 19 soldiers, whose mutilated bodies were found in the village of Zaki-Biam on October 12. According to official statements, the soldiers had been deployed to the area to restore law and order following clashes between the Tiv and Jukun ethnic groups. Benue and neighboring Taraba states, in central Nigeria, have been the scene of longstanding disputes between these two groups, which erupted again in recent weeks.  According to information received from local sources, including Nigerian human rights groups, the military operation began on Monday, October 22, when soldiers from the 23rd armored brigade of the 3rd armored division of the Nigerian army rounded up residents in Gbeji village for a “meeting,” made them sit on the ground, separated the men from the others, and then opened fire upon the men indiscriminately. Witnesses reported that some of the victims’ bodies were then set ablaze. Further killings took place as soldiers invaded the villages of Vasae, Anyiin Iorja, Ugba, Sankera and Zaki-Biam, all located in the two local government areas of Logo and Zaki-Biam. In the following two days, there was widespread destruction of property and buildings in these villages, after terrified residents had abandoned their homes.  While the total number of victims has not yet been established, survivors and eyewitnesses have reported that at least 100 and possibly more than 200 people died at the hands of the soldiers. Thousands of people have been displaced or have fled into the bush for safety.  The situation in the area remains extremely tense. There is still a heavy military presence and the troops who carried out the operation have reportedly not been withdrawn. A dusk to dawn curfew has been imposed. On October 24 and 25 further violence broke out, including around the university in the state capital Makurdi, where students and others staged protests at the army’s actions. Vehicles and tires were set ablaze. There were reports of further deaths and injuries.  The killing of the 19 soldiers was energetically condemned by the Nigerian federal government. At their state funeral on October 22, President Olusegun Obasanjo publicly urged the security forces to spare no effort in tracking down those responsible.  The situation in Benue was reminiscent of a sequence of events in the town of Odi, in Bayelsa state in southern Nigeria, in November 1999, when soldiers seeking to avenge the murder of 12 policemen by local armed groups razed the entire town and killed scores of civilians.  “Tragically, the lessons of Odi have not been learned,” said Takirambudde. “After the discovery of the soldiers’ bodies, the Nigerian authorities could easily have predicted that anger in the military would lead to revenge. Everyone was talking about the likelihood of retaliation, yet no steps appear to have been taken to prevent the military from retaliating.”  No member of the armed forces is known to have been prosecuted for the events in Odi. Human Rights Watch urged that the government’s response to events in Benue must not be characterized by the same negligence.  “President Obasanjo must accept responsibility for the actions of the Nigerian army and put an end to the impunity which protects the Nigerian armed forces,” said Takirambudde.  Human Rights Watch also warned that these latest events would aggravate an already tense situation in Benue and neighboring states in central Nigeria which have been the scene of repeated inter-communal violence in the last few months. Hundreds of people have lost their lives in clashes between different ethnic groups in Benue, Nasarawa, Taraba and Plateau States and tens of thousands have been displaced.  “The Nigerian Government has a responsibility to tackle the roots of these problems and restore peace in the area,” said Takirambudde. “It cannot just stand by and watch, or intervene only when members of its own security forces are affected.”","Africa, Nigeria",""

The first U.S.-Africa Trade and Economic Cooperation Forum, to be held in Washington on October 29-30, is required by the AGOA, which Congress passed in 2000.  In letters addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick, Human Rights Watch said the U.S. government had not used human rights criteria contained in the legislation to improve human rights performance in the beneficiary countries.  “The Congress created a useful tool for promoting human rights in Africa, but the U.S. government isn’t using it,” said Janet Fleischman, Washington Director for the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch does not take a position on whether or not particular states should be eligible for benefits under the AGOA law. But the legislation includes labor rights and human rights criteria, and requires that beneficiary countries not “engage in gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.”  Human Rights Watch cited several cases where the U.S. State Department itself has documented abusive practices by recipient countries, but the U.S. government has not made clear how those findings will affect trade relationships with those countries, as the AGOA requires.","Africa, United States",""

Mazar-i Sharif, the largest city in northern Afghanistan, has an ethnically-mixed population. It has been the site of previous atrocities by Taliban and United Front forces.  United Front forces were forced to retreat from their positions near the city's airport late last week, but over the weekend U.S. planes paved the way for a renewed United Front offensive by striking Taliban positions near the city and the opposition-held enclave of Dara-i Suf to its south. """"The last thing we need is a renewal of the indiscriminate violence that paved the way for the Taliban in the first place,"""" said Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch cautioned that a violent end to Taliban rule in Mazar-i Sharif could pave the way for retaliation by UF forces against local Pashtun civilians and others perceived to be associated with Taliban rule.  After retaking Mazar-i Sharif in August 1998, Taliban forces killed about 2000 mostly ethnic Hazara civilians. The Taliban-installed governor publicly called the Hazaras, who are Shi'a Muslims, """"infidels"""" and threatened them with death if they did not convert to Sunni Islam or leave Afghanistan. Hundreds of Hazara civilians fled the city. Since 1998, the Taliban have also allowed farmers and nomads from communities that are locally aligned with them, particularly Pashtuns, to encroach on land cultivated by minority ethnic groups south of Mazar-i Sharif.  Human Rights Watch said these abuses by the Taliban could lead to reprisals as power shifts. The past conduct of United Front forces in this part of Afghanistan is not encouraging. In May 1997, United Front forces under the command of Gen. Abdul Malik Pahlawan killed an estimated 3,000 Taliban prisoners in Mazar-i Sharif, taking some to the desert to be shot and throwing others down wells and blowing them up with grenades.  Pahlawan himself is no longer a member of the United Front. However, other commanders who remain with the Front amassed a deplorable record of attacks on civilians between the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 and the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan",""

Ms. Tungar-Tudu, who is pregnant, has until November 8 to file an appeal. The court's ruling is pending approval by the governor of Sokoto State after which a date to mete out the punishment will be fixed. The man she allegedly had sex with was set free by the same court after concluding that it lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute him for the alleged adultery.  Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. Additionally, international law strictly prohibits the imposition of capital punishment on a pregnant woman.  In recent years, several states in Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria have extended the application of Sharia law to criminal offenses, imposing Sharia punishments for theft and other crimes, and criminalizing acts such as pre-marital sex and alcohol consumption.  Ms. Tungar-Tudu's conviction for pre-marital sex is the second one to be reported in northern Nigeria. In September 2000, an Islamic court in the northern state of Zamfara, sentenced Bariya Ibrahim Magazu, a teenage girl, to 180 lashes for pre-marital sex and bringing false charges against men with whom she allegedly had sex. Despite protests by international and Nigerian human rights groups against her sentence, officials authorized the flogging of Ms. Magazu. Even though her appeal remained pending, the sentence was carried out; she was lashed one hundred times on January 19, 2001.  In another case, a Sharia court found a fifteen-year-old boy guilty of stealing money. He was sentenced to the amputation of his hand. Amputation is an extreme form of corporal punishment, which is expressly prohibited by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Human Rights Watch wrote to the governor of Kebbi State on October 12, 2001, expressing its concern over the case.  Human Rights Watch called on the Nigerian government to protect Ms. Tungar-Tudu from the arbitrary meting out of a harsh and unacceptable punishment, and to ensure that the courts operate in accordance with international human rights law and the bill of rights in Nigeria's own constitution.","Africa, Nigeria","Women's Rights"

We urge you to intervene on her behalf to prevent this cruel and inhuman punishment from being meted out against her.   As an international organization committed to the defense of basic human rights, we oppose the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty. Additionally, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Nigeria ratified in July 1993, strictly prohibits the imposition of capital punishment on a pregnant woman.   International human rights law guarantees women the right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexual autonomy, without coercion, discrimination, and violence. Therefore, when a woman is severely punished for pre-marital sex, her right to make free decisions regarding her body is violated.   Based on the information we received, on October 9, 2001, the Islamic court in Gwadabawa, Sokoto State, in northern Nigeria sentenced Ms. Tungar-Tudu to death after finding her guilty of having pre-marital sex, a punishable offence under Sharia law. Ms. Tungar-Tudu has until November 8 to file an appeal. We understand that the court's ruling is pending approval by the governor of Sokoto State, after which a date to mete out the punishment will be fixed.   The cornerstone of human rights is respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person. These principles cannot be reconciled with the death penalty, a form of punishment that is unique in its barbarity and finality.   Human Rights Watch urges you to ensure that this cruel and inhuman sentence is not carried out.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/22/human-rights-watch-commentary-2-draft-comprehensive-convention-terrorism","Human Rights Watch Commentary 2 on the Draft Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism","Human Rights Watch Commentary 2 on the Draft Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism","Articles 2 and 18","10/22/2001","As the United Nations (UN) General Assembly’s Sixth Committee continues to discuss the Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (“the Comprehensive Convention”) Human Rights Watch believes that it is crucial that the Comprehensive Convention’s text uphold longstanding and universally-recognized international human rights standards. Human Rights Watch is concerned that certain provisions of the draft Comprehensive Convention could be interpreted in such a way as to undermine and conflict with fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights law. Human Rights Watch is aware that provisions similar to those discussed below do appear in UN Conventions aimed at curbing specific terrorist activities, in particular the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, adopted on 15 December 1997, and the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, adopted on 9 December 1999. We believe, however, that the current draft, which is intended to be a more comprehensive instrument, requires a special effort to achieve thorough human rights protections and guarantees. In this our second commentary, we offer three recommendations for your consideration. We address in particular Articles 2 and 18 of the current draft.  Recommendation 1:  Maintain general conformity with international humanitarian law and human rights law The text should include an operative provision that guarantees that the Comprehensive Convention fully take into account the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and human rights law.   Comment As set out in our first commentary of October 17, we believe that the Comprehensive Convention should contain an article that guarantees the Convention be in conformity with international humanitarian law and human rights law. Such a provision should state that nothing in the Convention should be construed as impairing, contradicting, restricting or derogating from the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights, and other international instruments of human rights law, refugee law, and international humanitarian law applicable to the specific situations and circumstances dealt with by the Convention.   Recommendation 2: Preserve principles of international humanitarian and human rights law in the definition of terrorism The wording of Article 2(1)(a) and (b) and Article 18 should not allow interpretations that could weaken accepted principles and practices of international humanitarian or human rights law Comment The current wording of Article 2(1) and (b) could be interpreted as making certain acts committed during non-international armed conflicts, which are not presently prohibited by international humanitarian law, into international crimes. For example, international law regulating non-international armed conflicts does not prohibit members of rebel forces from using force against enemy government soldiers or property, provided the basic tenets governing such use of force are respected. Such use of force is not currently an international crime, although it could well be a criminal act under national laws. Members of rebel forces can thus be prosecuted under ordinary criminal law for acts of violence if they fall into the hands of national authorities. The fact that more than 150 states have become parties to Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions is an indication of the overwhelming acceptance of an international legal regime that does not criminalize certain acts of violence committed during internal armed conflicts, unless such acts in themselves constitute international crimes, such as crimes against humanity. Many countries currently choose to grant asylum to members of foreign rebel forces who may have fought against their own governments, but who have not contravened international humanitarian law. Most countries have also freely undertaken international legal obligations that prevent them from returning,  expelling or extraditing a person to his or her country of origin if there is sufficient reason to believe that the person is at risk of torture or other violations of fundamental human rights.  The current wording of Article 2(1) and (2) would create an obligation on all states parties to the Comprehensive Convention to prosecute those individuals or extradite them to their countries of origin. This would significantly weakens important protections afforded by principles and practice of international law. That the acts listed in Article 2 must be committed “unlawfully” does not dispel the concerns addressed above, since it is not clear that the word “unlawfully” in the Comprehensive Convention equates with unlawfulness under international law. Article 18 may also be subject to a variety of interpretations, some of which could undermine human rights protections. The wording of Article 18(1) appears to be clear in relation to the rights, obligations and responsibilities that “States” have under international humanitarian law while conducting hostilities. However, this clarity is not mirrored in relation to non-governmental forces taking part in an internal conflict.  Indeed, the term “individuals” does not clearly or necessarily encompass the concept of “dissident armed forces or other organized armed groups,” as specified in Article 1 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions, which establishes the material field of application of the Protocol. The wording of 18(2) is likewise confusing and ambiguous. The article appears to distinguish between two types of military activity, both of which are to be excluded from the material field of application of this Convention. The first is “the activities of armed forces during an armed conflict,” which suggests that the second, “activities undertaken by the military forces of a State in the exercise of their official duties,” is intended to cover military activities carried out in the absence of an armed conflict. If this is the case, a potential situation of impunity may have been allowed for, in that some serious human rights violations carried out by military personnel in times of peace – which are thus not covered by international humanitarian law – may not be covered either by the Comprehensive Convention. Further, it is not entirely clear why Article 18(2) makes a distinction between “armed forces” and “military forces of a State.”  Recommendation 3: Avoid concepts that would contradict principles of international human rights aw in the specification of acts of terrorism The wording of Article 2(3) should not allow interpretations that could undermine the exercise of freedom of expression.   Comment The wording of Article 2(3)(c) is confusing and could be read in a dangerously expansive manner. According to this text, an individual could be considered to have committed an offense within the meaning of the Comprehensive Convention if,  for example, he or she proclaims or publishes views or opinions that are deemed to contribute “in any other way” to the commission of the other offenses described in Article 2. Thus, publishing an article expressing political purposes similar to those of, say, an armed pro-independence or autonomist group, could be seen as furthering the “purpose of the group,” even if the author of the article does not belong to or directly participate in the activities of such a group.  Human Rights Watch urges that if Article 2(3) is retained, it should be modified so as to ensure that it cannot be read in any way which would allow it to be used to penalize any form of freedom of expression falling short of criminal incitement.","","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, United Nations"

Congressional leaders have bypassed an official conference to reconcile the two bills, with the final version now being negotiated out of public view. Both bills grant unprecedented broad powers to the Attorney General to certify and then detain non-citizens suspected of terrorist activities or of threatening national security. """"Personal liberty should not be a casualty of the campaign against terrorism,"""" said Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"We believe Congress can develop anti-terrorism measures that protect the nation without sacrificing important rights.""""  According to Human Rights Watch, the breadth and vagueness of the criteria for the certification and detention of non-citizens raise the possibility of arbitrary or abusive application. If the detainees are not criminally charged or deported from the country, they would remain in administrative detention until the Attorney General determines they are no longer risks to national security. While judicial review of the detention would be permitted, neither bill ensures meaningful, prompt or periodic reviews to ensure the detention is warranted. Human Rights Watch urges Congress to incorporate safeguards for the rights of detainees in the anti-terrorist legislation, including:  Precise guidelines for determining when detention is necessary; Prompt, periodic reviews of the initial and continued detention; A prohibition against indefinite detention and safeguards against it.""""Non-citizens no less than citizens have a right to freedom from arbitrary or indefinite administrative detention, """" said Roth.

Washington, D.C. 20520 Dear Secretary Powell,  As the frontline in northern Afghanistan shifts to the outskirts of Mazar-i Sharif, Human Rights Watch is concerned about the risk of ethnically-targeted violence and other abuses against civilians in the area. We believe the United States should use its influence with the United Front (Northern Alliance) to ensure that their forces do not engage in reprisal killings, indiscriminate shelling, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law.  Both the city of Mazar-i Sharif and the surrounding countryside are ethnically mixed, with substantial Uzbek, Tajik, Turkmen, Hazara, and Pashtun communities. Ethnic relations in the region have been polarized by the rule of ethnically-based parties, particularly that of the Taliban. After retaking Mazar-i Sharif in August 1998, Taliban forces killed about 2000 mostly ethnic Hazara civilians. The Taliban-installed governor publicly called the Hazaras, who are Shi'a Muslims, """"infidels"""" and threatened them with death if they did not convert to Sunni Islam or leave Afghanistan. Hundreds of Hazara civilians fled the city. Since 1998, the Taliban have also allowed farmers and pastoralists from communities that are locally aligned with them, particularly Pashtuns, to encroach on land cultivated by minority ethnic groups south of Mazar-i Sharif.  These abuses may provide motivation for reprisal actions by United Front forces against local Pashtun civilians, Taliban prisoners, and others perceived to be associated with Taliban rule. In this regard, the United Front's past record, especially in this part of Afghanistan, is reason for great concern. In May 1997, United Front forces under the command of Gen. Abdul Malik Pahlawan killed an estimated 3,000 Taliban prisoners in Mazar-i Sharif, taking some to the desert to be shot and throwing others down wells and blowing them up with grenades. Pahlawan himself is no longer a member of the United Front. However, other commanders who remain with the Front amassed a deplorable record of attacks on civilians between the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 and the Taliban's capture of Kabul in 1996. To date, not a single Afghan commander-of the Taliban or United Front-has been held accountable for violations of international humanitarian law. This has fed the cycle of impunity and encouraged further such abuses.  Although the United States has said that it is not coordinating its military strategy with the United Front, its targeting of Taliban military installations - and in some cases, front-line positions - has given a strategic advantage to the United Front. The United States should use the influence that it now has with the United Front to impress on its leaders the need to observe basic human rights and to make clear that they will be held accountable for any abuses that might occur. Not only would reprisals in Mazar-i Sharif discredit the anti-Taliban alliance and those who have enabled its victory, it will herald a renewal of the indiscriminate violence that paved the way for the Taliban taking power.  We therefore call on you to urge the United Front forces advancing on Mazar-i Sharif to respect the rights of civilians and other non-combatants, to refrain from reprisals, and to refrain from indiscriminate shelling.

Ravshan Haidov, age 32, died in police custody this week. Haidov, the father of two, is the latest victim in Uzbekistan's vicious crackdown on Muslims who practice their faith outside state controls.  Human Rights Watch learned from informed sources that on October 17, Tashkent police arrested Ravshan Haidov and his younger brother, Rasul Haidov, 25. Police reportedly took the brothers to the Sobir Rahimov district police station for interrogation on suspicion of affiliation with the banned Islamic group, Hizb ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation).  Ravshan Haidov's body was returned to his family on October 18. Those who viewed the body reported that Haidov's neck was broken, as was one leg, below the knee, that his upper back was injured, and that his body was covered with bruises. The official cause of death was given as a heart attack. """"This death follows a distinct pattern in Uzbekistan of police torture of religious detainees and dissidents,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. Ravshan Haidov's brother, Rasul, is reportedly being hospitalized, under police guard, following his interrogation.  Local rights activists estimate that at least 7,000 independent Muslims are now imprisoned in Uzbekistan for their religious practices or affiliations, and that some 4,000 of these were convicted for affiliation with Hizb ut-Tahrir. The government has justified their arrests by claiming they support terrorism, though the vast majority are not charged for acts of violence. Uzbekistan is emerging as one of the strongest regional supporters of the U.S.-led military campaign in Afghanistan, in response to the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. More than 1,000 U.S. troops are already stationed in Uzbekistan and last Friday the two countries announced the formation of a """"qualitatively new relationship."""" The Chairman-in-Office of the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe is scheduled to meet with Uzbek President Islam Karimov on October 22. """"It's never been more important to urge the Uzbek government to clean up its act,"""" said Andersen. """"Otherwise the U.S. and its allies could be seen as aligning itself with a government that tortures non-violent Muslims to death in the name of fighting terrorism.""""  At least fifteen people have died in Uzbek custody due to torture in the past three years. In July 2001, human rights defender Shovrik Ruzimuradov also died in police custody under highly suspicious circumstances, suggesting he also was the victim of torture. The official explanation for Ruzimuradov's death was suicide by hanging.  The Tashkent city prosecutor's office reportedly opened a criminal case against four police officers from the Sobir Rahimov district police station in relation to Ravshan Haidov's death.

Foreign Ministers on Security Concerns Raised by Arms Transfers from Candidate Countries","","10/19/2001","Your Excellency:   The forthcoming meeting of the European Conference in Brussels, Belgium, will bring together European Union member states, aspirant E.U. members, and other invited delegations to discuss terrorism. We hope that as you work together to combat terrorism, you will also remain vigilant to the grave security risks posed by irresponsible arms trading practices in central and eastern Europe. We further hope that you incorporate measures to improve arms trade controls across Europe into the E.U.'s anti-terrorism strategy and assess arms trade practices, together with other political and security issues, when evaluating the progress of candidate countries toward E.U. accession.   It would be a mistake not to do so. Uncontrolled arms flows contribute to lawlessness and insecurity in both supplier and recipient countries, as well as enabling violence against civilians. Weak arms trade controls permit weapons to flow freely to areas of tension and violent conflict where they fuel violence and generate further instability. Governmental forces and non-state actors who show no respect for civilian life readily obtain weapons with which to further terrorize innocent populations. Moreover, the activities of illicit arms traffickers, allowed to act with impunity, undermine customs and border controls, fuel corruption and cross-border smuggling, and help finance criminal networks. An international weapons trade that permits anyone, anywhere to obtain arms-irrespective of the risks those weapons will be misused-is one that potentially poses a threat to everyone, everywhere.   In this light, it is deeply troubling that arms trade controls in a number E.U. aspirant countries are inadequate, poorly implemented, and rarely enforced. There has been some momentum toward reform, in part the result of international pressure; however, the problem remains a serious one.   A few recent cases illustrate arms transfers from central and eastern Europe and identify systematic weaknesses in legal controls. Although focused on arms flows to Africa, they point to a problem that has dangerous implications for other regions and indeed for global security.   Bulgaria. The Bulgarian government has made some progress in curbing the illegal arms trade and disposing responsibly of surplus small arms, but more remains to be done to consolidate gains and halt irresponsible arms supplies. Promised legislation institutionalizing arms reforms continues to languish, and there is no indication the legal changes will incorporate human rights criteria. Allegations of the involvement of organized criminal networks in arms trafficking persist.   Moreover, Bulgaria continues to sell off huge stocks of surplus, Soviet-era weapons. Past practice, including confirmed sales of tanks in recent years to Angola, Ethiopia, and Uganda, suggested Bulgaria will not live up to its promises to restrain its arms trade when seeking clients for surplus weapons.   Czech Republic. In 2000 the Czech Republic delivered surplus tanks sold to Yemen despite concerns that they might be illegally diverted, as had happened a year earlier with tanks from Poland. The Polish tanks disappeared en route and were reportedly delivered to Sudan, which is under an E.U. embargo. In 2001 the Czech government initiated negotiations for further arms sales to Yemen.   There have also been allegations of illegal arms transfers, including an April 2001 case in which a Ukrainian plane carrying Czech weapons was halted at Bulgaria's Burgas airport on suspicion that the weapons were to be delivered to Eritrea, under a U.N. embargo at the time. Following an investigation, the cargo was released for delivery to Georgia, the authorized destination, although no explanation was given for reported discrepancies between the actual weapons cargo and that authorized for sale.   Romania. A U.N. investigative panel determined in 2000 that Romania was a source of weapons illegally supplied to embargoed rebel forces in Angola from 1996 to 1999. It noted that reforms were needed to improve controls, as the weapons were authorized for sale on the basis of falsified documents listing other countries as the intended recipients.  After initiating prosecution in 2000 against an arms dealer accused of illegal arms sales, Romanian authorities unexpectedly released him in 2001 and he left the country. The dealer, who maintained he was innocent, has implicated former Romanian officials in the trade.   Slovakia. Arms brokers and shipping agents have taken advantage of loose controls in Slovakia, including a legal loophole that permits weapons to transit through the country for up to seven days without a government license. Last month, a weapons shipment from Iran was impounded at Bratislava airport because the cargo was misdeclared on customs documents. It was apparently destined for Angola, with which Slovakia also engages in a direct arms trade despite that government's dismal human rights record.   In the case of direct exports, the Bratislava government maintains that it has halted all suspicious arms transactions and regularly checks the authenticity of the documents provided, but admits that it does not have the capacity to check whether weapons are in fact delivered to the authorized destinations.   We urge you to take these problems into consideration as you discuss jointly with the countries of central and eastern Europe what measure to take in the fight against terrorism. Many of the weaknesses that help make irresponsible arms deals possible-such as poor customs and border controls-also mar efforts to combat terrorism. As noted, without strict controls on the flow of weapons, arms can be made available to individuals and groups who are likely to misuse them. In this respect, efforts taken in the fight against terrorism and those designed to enhance controls over arms flows could be mutually reinforcing. For example, initiatives to improve border controls and increase intelligence exchanges could help prevent irresponsible weapons transfers; improved policing of weapons transfers and arms brokers could stem arms flows that risk falling into the wrong hands.   We would like to note that the leverage afforded by the process of E.U. enlargement, as well as the actions of the E.U. and individual member states to enhance transparency and restraint in the international arms trade and encourage needed reforms in central and eastern Europe, has been an important factor explaining the recognition by several of these countries that they must tighten arms trade controls. Relenting now in favor of a single-minded focus on terrorism that ignores the threats to security posed by uncontrolled arms transfers would send an unfortunate signal that efforts to rein in the arms trade may be abandoned, a casualty of the fight against terrorism.   Given the importance of strict arms trade controls, both in their own right and in relation to anti-terrorism efforts, we would like to suggest ways in which the E.U. can promote needed changes. In particular, we urge E.U. member states to take up action in three priority areas:  Promote the harmonization of arms trade controls within the E.U. to the highest possible standard and actively encourage candidate countries to undertake needed reforms to meet those standards. Provide technical, legal, and other assistance, as appropriate, to support national arms trade reform efforts by aspirant E.U. members. Continue to support the improvement of customs, border and other controls that have a bearing on arms trafficking in central and southeastern Europe.  Provide incentives, including financial assistance, for the responsible disposal (e.g., through destruction) of surplus military equipment held by candidate countries. Target heavy conventional weapons systems, as well as small arms and light weapons.  Explicitly identify responsible arms trading practices, including strict arms trade controls and the disposal of surplus weapons in conformity with human rights criteria, as a requirement for E.U. membership. Unambiguously declare that the 1998 E.U. Code of Conduct on Arms Exports forms part of the acquis communautaire, to which aspirant countries must conform.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/18/afghanistan-attacks-aid-increasing","Afghanistan- Attacks on Aid Increasing","Afghanistan: Attacks on Aid Increasing","","10/18/2001","(New York) -- Attacks on humanitarian relief agencies in Taliban-controlled areas of Afghanistan are increasing and must be stopped, Human Rights Watch said today, in releasing details of several attacks.   Human Rights Watch strongly urged all military forces in Afghanistan to ensure the safety of representatives and assets of humanitarian relief agencies.  On October 16, Taliban soldiers reportedly seized food warehouses of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) in Kabul and Kandahar, taking control of some 7,000 tons of food.  """"The Taliban and other armed elements are carrying out widespread attacks on humanitarian workers in Afghanistan, and stealing their equipment, supplies, and vehicles,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"These assaults directly affect the ability of humanitarian agencies to provide relief to a desperate civilian population.""""  Human Rights Watch said it had received credible reports of such attacks from the Taliban-controlled cities of Kandahar, Kabul, Jalalabad, and Mazar-i Sharif. While most of those responsible for the attacks appear to be Taliban fighters, non-Afghan fighters (known in Afghanistan as """"foreign guests"""") and rogue armed elements have also been involved.  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the bombardment by U.S. forces of two clearly-marked warehouses of the International Committee of the Red Cross in broad daylight on October 16.  The attacks carried out by the Taliban and other armed elements against humanitarian aid agencies include the following:  On the morning of October 7, armed Taliban entered the compound of a mine action NGO in Kabul. Staff members were beaten, and the Taliban broke some of the locks on vehicles, but did not take them. On October 8, armed Taliban entered the compound of the U.N. Coordinator for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Mazar-i Sharif and looted communications equipment. The Taliban destroyed the windows of nine U.N. vehicles at the compound before leaving. On October 8, armed Taliban entered the compound of a mine action NGO in Kandahar and demanded vehicles. Staff who resisted were beaten and ordered to leave the compound. The Taliban left with seven ambulances, seven pick-up trucks and six cargo trucks from the compound. Another demining agency working in Kandahar told Human Rights Watch that they had one vehicle confiscated by Taliban forces on September 26; three ambulances confiscated by Taliban on October 3; nine pick-up trucks confiscated by Taliban on October 11; and twenty-two additional vehicles taken by Taliban on October 15. The Taliban also looted the office of the demining agency, taking spare parts, generators, radios, and the personal assets of the demining workers. Staff who resisted the confiscations were reportedly beaten. None of the vehicles have been returned. On October 13, a group of some twenty armed men entered the Kandahar offices of the Islamic Relief Organization, demanding vehicles at gunpoint. Taliban security forces intervened, and a clash erupted. One vehicle was taken from the compound by the unidentified armed men. On October 15, armed men entered the Mazar-i Sharif offices of a demining agency. Officials of the agency told Human Rights Watch: """"They beat our guards [and] after that they broke the locks of the doors and entered into the office. They looted all the office equipment and left nothing behind in the office. The looted property includes three vehicles, computers, communication facilities, office equipment and utensils."""" The officials said their offices in other cities had been threatened and told that if they don't hand over all the vehicles and communication systems, the Taliban will take them by force. On the night of October 15, armed men entered the compound of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), beating two guards and looting the office. The same forces returned to the IOM compound on the morning of October 16 and removed three vehicles from the compound. The Kandahar and Mazar-i Sharif offices of Medecins sans Frontiers (Doctors Without Borders) were looted on October 15 by unidentified armed men. In addition to these cases, a number of humanitarian relief groups have reported incidents in which vehicles were seized at gunpoint by Taliban forces.  Human Rights Watch today also called on the U.S.-led military alliance to take all feasible steps to minimize injury to civilians and civilian objects as required by international humanitarian law in its air campaign over Afghanistan. International humanitarian law also obliges belligerents to respect the Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.  At about 1:00 p.m. on October 16, several U.S. bombs directly hit two warehouses of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) located two kilometers from the Kabul airport. One ICRC employee was wounded during the incident, and one of the warehouses burned down completely while the other sustained serious damage. The ICRC buildings were clearly marked with a red cross painted on a white background, visible from the air. The U.S. has acknowledged responsibility for the bombing of the ICRC warehouses, claiming that it had mistakenly believed that the buildings were military storehouses.  Humanitarian relief agencies have been hit in air strikes on at least two other occasions, but there is no evidence that the agency facilities were the intended targets. At about 9 p.m. on October 8, the Kabul compound of the U.N.-affiliated demining agency Afghan Technical Consultants (ATC) was struck in the course of a U.S. air attack, completely destroying the compound and killing four ATC staff members guarding the building and wounding four other staff.  On another occasion on October 15, shrapnel from U.S. bombs landing at the Kabul airport wounded an employee of the U.N. World Food Program (WFP) who was loading grain bags at a WFP warehouse located nearby. The incident halted what would have been the first OXFAM food delivery into the famine-stricken Hazarajat district of Afghanistan since September 11.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Xinjiang, a vast, oil-rich province in China's northwest, is home to 18 million people, some 40 percent of whom are ethnic Uighurs, a Muslim, Turkic-speaking ethnic group, many of whom advocate independence from Beijing. The alleged links of Uighur separatists to the al-Qaeda terrorist network is likely to be a topic of discussion at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Shanghai this weekend, where President Bush has put anti-terrorism efforts high on the agenda.  The Chinese government has thus far not made public any credible evidence of links between separatist organizations in Xinjiang and the al-Qaeda network.  """"Some individual Uighurs have made their way to Afghanistan, but that hardly justifies the broad crackdown now underway,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia Director of Human Rights Watch. """"APEC leaders should make it clear that the global effort against terrorism does not give China a blank check to suppress the basic rights of the Uighur community.""""  The backgrounder outlines the different separatist organizations that have emerged in Xinjiang, some of them violent, and recognizes China's legitimate security concerns. It notes, however, that these are overwhelming nationalist, not Islamist, in nature, and there is no indication of Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang reaching out to other ethnic groups of the same faith.  Moreover, in its campaigns to """"rectify social order"""" in Xinjiang, Chinese authorities have arbitrarily arrested many Uighurs not involved in separatist movements; closed mosques, schools, and Uighur-owned enterprises; and sentenced thousands of people to harsh prison terms after summary judicial procedures.  Imams are required be members of the """"patriotic clergy"""" and to """"stand on the side of the government"""" or face retaliation in different forms. Muslim students in all state-controlled institutions are not allowed to pray, keep the fast during Ramadan, or otherwise obey the precepts of Islam.  Suppression of social organizations has been so harsh that the number of such organizations in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi, declined by 50 percent between 1996 and 1999, according to official government figures.  The backgrounder notes that the Chinese government has provided diametrically opposed assessments of the security situation to different audiences. As part of its campaign to encourage foreign investment in western China, including Xinjiang, Chinese authorities insist that the situation is stable and secure, and only a handful of people are engaged in separatism. When the government wants international support for its campaign to eradicate opposition to Chinese rule in Xinjiang, however, it raises the spectre of Islamic terrorism.  """"Leaders meeting with Jiang Zemin at the APEC summit should underscore the need to distinguish between violent criminal acts and peaceful political and religious expression,"""" said Jones.

The broadly worded """"Prevention of Terrorism Ordinance,"""" which likely will be considered by the Indian parliament during its winter session beginning in November, sets forth a broad definition of terrorism that includes acts of violence or disruption of essential services carried out with """"intent to threaten the unity and integrity of India or to strike terror in any part of the people."""" It also extends existing law by making it a crime not to provide authorities with """"information relating to any terrorist activity.""""  """"We're concerned that the proposed law could open the door to police abuse,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"One can understand renewed concern with terrorism in light of recent events, but the new provisions are a throwback to earlier laws that caused nothing but trouble. In its haste to act, India should not repeat past mistakes.""""  If enacted, the ordinance would reinstate a modified version of the notorious Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA), repealed in 1995 after widespread public protest. TADA facilitated tens of thousands of arrests, detentions, and acts of torture in violation of international law, and was used to crack down on political opponents, social activists, and human rights defenders.  The newly proposed law contains certain safeguards not included in TADA, including immediate notification of family members following arrest and restrictions on the use of confessions extracted by torture, but it is more stringent than a criminal law bill that had been in the works to replace TADA. In putting forward the new proposal, the Indian cabinet rejected the pending criminal law bill, deeming it """"too weak to provide a legal framework for combating terrorism.""""  Human Rights Watch has also criticized proposed changes to U.S. law and policy since September 11 that would unduly increase police powers and restrict the rights of refugees, asylum-seekers, and other foreigners. In a letter to U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft dated September 28, Human Rights Watch cautioned that the """"danger to the United States posed by terrorist activities should not be used as a justification to expand [police] powers in ways that undermine the rights to liberty and due process of law possessed by citizen and non-citizen alike."""" The organization is also closely following developments in the UK, where amendments to existing anti-terrorism legislation are likely to be announced shortly.

Human Rights Watch also cautioned against a global backlash against migrants and refugees in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States.  """"The backlash against refugees, asylum seekers and migrants throughout the world is a serious side effect of the September 11 attacks,"""" said Rachael Reilly, refugee policy director for Human Rights Watch. """"While governments have legitimate security concerns, there must be a balance with human rights and refugee protection standards. Otherwise, not only Afghans, but many other refugees and asylum seekers may be unable to find the refuge they so desperately need.""""  Human Rights Watch called on countries neighboring Afghanistan to keep borders open to Afghan refugees in accordance with their international obligations. The backgrounder also urged the international community to work with host countries and the United Nations to put in place border mechanisms to separate armed elements from civilian refugees.  Human Rights Watch urged donor governments to ensure that urgently needed humanitarian assistance reaches those most in need in Afghanistan. This depends in part on the cooperation of the Taliban to guarantee the security of humanitarian workers. For information about attacks on humanitarian aid in Afghanistan, see the Human Rights Watch press release Afghanistan: Attacks on Aid Increasing.  """"Time is running out for people in Afghanistan,"""" said Reilly. """"Winter is fast approaching and thousands of people, especially women and children, are facing starvation. At the same time refugees are blocked from fleeing because neighboring countries continue to close their borders. The international community and neighboring countries must act now to avert a humanitarian disaster.""""  Although the influx of refugees into neighboring countries has been smaller than expected, refugees may be deterred by border closures, as well as the high cost of transport and smugglers fees needed to enter unofficially. Reilly also raised concerns about the risks posed to refugees forced to enter Pakistan by heavily mined unofficial routes and passes.  The backgrounder also traced new immigration legislation and anti-terrorism measures introduced by countries around the world, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and various other European Union countries in response to the September 11 attacks.

While other states in the region remained equivocal and noncommittal, Uzbekistan welcomed an early October visit from U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and announced that the U.S. could use its air space and several of its airfields. More than 1,000 U.S. troops are already stationed in Uzbekistan and last Friday the two countries announced the formation of a """"qualitatively new relationship."""" Uzbekistan's enthusiasm for the antiterror campaign should be no mystery. It's an opportunity to reinforce its independence from Russia and enlist the U.S. in battle against its own Islamic insurgency -- the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is based in Afghanistan. What the U.S. gets is more ambiguous. In the short run, it will benefit from the use of Uzbek bases. But if it becomes too closely affiliated with Uzbekistan's corrupt and abusive government, the unintended consequences could haunt the U.S. after its immediate goals in Afghanistan are met. The Bush administration has repeatedly said that the antiterrorism effort would be multifaceted, emphasizing effective diplomacy as much or more than the military efforts. The U.S. needs to be asking Uzbek President Islam Karimov not just for a landing strip, but also for a dramatic turnaround in his own domestic policies. Otherwise, by continuing to impoverish and alienate its own people, Mr. Karimov's government may contribute more to the problem of instability and violence in Central Asia than to the solution. Mr. Karimov is a holdover from the Soviet times and his political and economic performance bears the stamp of that era. On the economic front, 10 years of independence have brought the Uzbek people crippling poverty. The pace of economic reform is so slow that the IMF gave up and removed its representative in March. In its most recent country strategy for Uzbekistan, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development concluded that it could justify only limited future investments in the country. In politics Mr. Karimov similarly resists reform and rules with an iron fist. The government recognizes no political parties other than those aligned with the president, and organized political opposition is not tolerated. The state exercises tight control over the media, including through pre-publication censorship. There are no independent news outlets. Journalists critical of the government are routinely threatened by state authorities and have been driven out of the country under threat of arrest. There is no freedom of assembly: Police violently disband any attempts at public demonstrations and arrest the participants. Torture is rampant, with police and agents of the National Security Service (the successor to the Uzbek KGB) regularly hanging criminal suspects and political detainees by their feet or wrists, beating them with batons or bottles filled with water, applying electroshock to their bodies, and raping or threatening to rape them. Police torture has resulted in at least 15 deaths in custody in the past two years alone. Since 1997, those most brutally victimized have been Muslims who practice their faith outside of government control, their families, and their defenders. Local human-rights activists estimate that 7,000 independent Muslims are currently serving terms in Uzbekistan's prisons. Charged with """"anti-state activity"""" for studying the Koran, following a disfavored imam, or possessing religious literature not sanctioned by the state, these men face prison sentences up to 20 years. As the Bush administration has acknowledged, the key challenge facing the collation is to fight terrorism without being seen as fighting the peaceful expression of Islam. Uzbekistan's policies, which make no such distinction, undermine that goal. Thus Uzbekistan's most important contribution to the global antiterror effort might be to clean up its own act: create the legal, political, and social space for the peaceful expression of alternative views; implement electoral reform along the lines suggested by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe; make meaningful progress toward freedom of association, including the registration of local human-rights organizations and other civil society groups; repeal the repressive religion law and cease arbitrary arrest and detention of peaceful religious believers; release those unlawfully imprisoned; and allow the development of free and independent media. An antiterror coalition that aims to defend democracy, human rights, and the values that came under attack on September 11, can expect no less of the nations that seek to join. Meeting in Tashkent recently, U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Mr. Karimov assured reporters that there was no quid pro quo for America's use of Uzbekistani territory. Certainly no favors need be bestowed on Uzbekistan, which benefits handsomely from the partnership. But if the U.S. and its allies are looking beyond the immediate military campaign to the long-term stability of the region and its likely impact on their antiterrorism efforts, they should be demanding more of the Karimov government in return. ____**) Ms. Andersen is the executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/17/human-rights-watch-commentary-draft-comprehensive-convention-terrorism","Human Rights Watch Commentary on the Draft Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism","Human Rights Watch Commentary on the Draft Comprehensive Convention on Terrorism","","10/17/2001","As the United Nations General Assembly’s Sixth Committee resumes it negotiations on the Draft Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism (“the Comprehensive Convention”) Human Rights Watch believes that it is crucial that the Comprehensive Convention’s text uphold longstanding and universally-recognized international human rights standards. In a time of international crisis, there is a danger in hastily adopting measures that will have far-reaching and long-term consequences.  This is of particular concern where the issues at stake impinge upon the protection of fundamental human rights.  We believe that governments committed to human rights standards must work to ensure that any provisions included in the Comprehensive Convention comply fully with international human rights and humanitarian law. Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned that certain provisions of the draft Comprehensive Convention could undermine and conflict with fundamental and long enshrined international refugee protection standards. Provisions already exist under international refugee law to prevent individuals who have committed terrorist acts or other serious crimes from benefiting from refugee protection.  We offer below four recommendations for your consideration, focusing on the international law context and the protection of refugees.  Of particular concern are Articles 7, 14, and 15 of the draft text.  Recommendation 1:  Conformity with International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law The text should include an operative provision that that takes fully into account the context of international humanitarian law and human rights law.   Comment This provision should make clear that nothing in the Comprehensive Convention should be construed as impairing, contradicting, restricting or derogating from the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Human Rights and other international instruments, commitments of human rights law, refugee law, and international humanitarian law applicable to the specific situations and circumstances dealt with by this convention.  Recommendation 2: Article 15 and the Principle of Non-Refoulement Human Rights Watch urges that Article 15 of the Comprehensive Convention make specific reference to the binding principle of non-refoulement as stipulated under the Refugee Convention, international customary law, the Convention against Torture, and the European Convention on Human Rights  Comment Governments should ensure that anti-terrorist measures under no circumstances undermine the fundamental principle of non-refoulement.  The right of a refugee not to be returned to a country where her life or freedom would be threatened on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is the cornerstone of international refugee protection. The principle of non-refoulement is enshrined in Article 33 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (the “Refugee Convention”) and is a well-established principle of international customary law. title="""""""">1   Thus even governments that are not party to the Refugee Convention, are still bound by obligations of non-refoulement. All refugees (regardless of whether their status has been individually adjudicated or not) are entitled to protection from refoulement.  Non-refoulement not only means that a refugee cannot be sent to his country of origin. Non-refoulement also means that he cannot be sent to any other country where his life or freedom is under threat. Moreover, the phrase “any manner whatsoever” should prevent a government from sending a refugee to a second country when it is known that the second country intends to send the refugee to a third country where his life or freedom is threatened. If a government has not determined refugee status for a particular person, and is considering sending that person to a place where his life or freedom is under threat, then that government must first determine whether the individual concerned is a refugee before taking any other action against him or her. Furthermore, the principle of non-refoulement has evolved beyond the Refugee Convention.  Article 3 of the 1984 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the “Convention against Torture”) also stipulates that no State Party “shall expel, return (“refouler”) or extradite a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.”  When determining whether there are such grounds, States should take into account all relevant considerations including “the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violation of human rights.” Non-refoulement protections are also provided under the 1951 European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (hereafter referred to as the European Convention).  Other international human rights standards clearly establish that even an individual that does not benefit from refugee protection should not be returned to a place where he or she would be subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, summary or arbitrary execution, or prolonged arbitrary detention.  Recommendation 3 : Article 7 and Exclusion from International Refugee Protection Human Rights Watch believes that there is no need to amend or re-interpret existing provisions under international refugee law to exclude certain individuals from refugee protection.  At the very minimum, Article 7 should stipulate that all measures must be adopted in accordance with relevant provisions of international refugee and human rights law. Comment Provisions already exist under international refugee law to exclude certain individuals from international refugee protection. Human Rights Watch considers the Refugee Convention to be sufficiently flexible to allow states to exclude terrorists and other serious criminals from refugee protection. The Refugee Convention clearly defines those categories of individuals who should be excluded from international refugee protection.  Article 1(f) of the Refugee Convention – containing the so-called “exclusion clauses” – ensures that perpetrators of gross human rights violations and serious non-political crimes are excluded from protection under the refugee regime. Individuals are excludable under the Refugee Convention if there are serious reasons for believing that they have committed certain kinds of acts. href=""""#_ftn2"""" name=""""_ftnref2"""" title="""""""">2 These provisions should be sufficient to prevent organizers and perpetrators of terrorist acts and other serious crimes from abusing the asylum system to enter a country.  Recommendation 4: Article 14 and Expulsion of Refugees Human Rights Watch  recommends that Article 14 contain language to ensure that any measures regarding extradition are fully in compliance with international refugee protection standards, in particular non-refoulement obligations. Comment  Human Rights Watch is concerned that Article 14 of the Comprehensive Convention could undermine fundamental principles of non-refoulement and international refugee protection. The Refugee Convention allows for the expulsion of a refugee from a country of asylum to any country other than one where his or her life or freedom would be threatened, but only if he or she is considered to pose a serious danger to the security or community of that country.  Article 32 of the Refugee Convention allows states to expel a refugee on “grounds of national security or public order,” but stipulates certain procedural guarantees must be applied in such cases.  In particular, the decision to expel must be “reached in accordance with due process of law” and “except where compelling reasons of national security otherwise require” the refugee must be able to submit evidence to clear himself, to appeal to a competent authority and receive legal representation, and have a reasonable period to seek legal admission into another country. The only instance under which a refugee who has not been excluded from refugee protection under Article 1(f) can be returned to a country where his or her life or freedom is threatened, is when Article 33(2) of the Convention applies. title="""""""">3 It is important to note that the two exceptions provided in Article 33 (2)  only apply to impacts in the country of asylum and do not, for example, apply to a past political crime that does not endanger the security of the country of asylum.  A government cannot, for example, agree to the extradition request for a refugee who is not a danger to the host government’s community when honoring that request would send the refugee to a place where her life or freedom would be threatened.   Human Rights Watch looks forward to discussing with you these and other issues related to the Comprehensive Convention as they arise.    href=""""#_ftnref1"""" name=""""_ftn1"""" title="""""""">1 Article 33 states that:  “No Contracting State shall expel, or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership or a particular social group or political opinion.”  name=""""_ftn2"""" title="""""""">2 Article 1 (f) of the Refugee Convention states:  The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes; b) he has committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge prior to (his) admission to that country as a refugee; and c) he has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations  name=""""_ftn3"""" title="""""""">3 Article 33 (2) stipulates that: The benefit of the present provision may not, however, be claimed by a refugee whom there are reasonable grounds for regarding as a danger to the security of the country in which he is, or who, having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, constitutes a danger to the community of that country.","","Terrorism / Counterterrorism, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/16/international-humanitarian-law-issues-and-afghan-conflict","International Humanitarian Law Issues and the Afghan Conflict","International Humanitarian Law Issues and the Afghan Conflict","Open Letter to North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Defense Ministers","10/16/2001","Re: International Humanitarian Law Issues and the Afghan Conflict Your Excellency: The initiation of armed conflict between the United States-led coalition and Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks on the U.S. raises a number of important international humanitarian law (IHL) issues. For more than a decade Human Rights Watch has monitored and reported on violations of IHL in numerous armed conflicts, including Iraq (1991) and Yugoslavia (1999) in which the United States was a participant. Based on that experience, we are writing to encourage the participating armed forces to implement the lessons learned from recent international conflicts. We will be writing separately to the various factions in Afghanistan regarding our international humanitarian law concerns. I. Weapons Systems As you know, international humanitarian law prohibits the use of weapons under circumstances in which no discrimination can be made between military targets and civilians. We are specifically concerned with the use of cluster bombs and anti-personnel landmines under conditions that do not meet this standard.  Cluster Bombs Cluster bombs, employed widely in the Gulf War as well as in the NATO air war in Kosovo, are being used by the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. They present a hazard to civilians similar to landmines. The """"bomblets"""" they release have been consistently shown to have a high initial dud rate. This leaves many highly volatile explosives that, by their nature, cannot distinguish between combatants and civilians. The problem is compounded by the large number of submunitions contained in each cluster bomb. Even if their initial dud rate were reduced, cluster bombs are typically dispersed over wide areas, and thus can be indiscriminate if used near areas populated by civilians. It is clear that at the present time, the use of even the most sophisticated cluster bombs poses grave and unacceptable dangers to civilian populations. It has been the position of Human Rights Watch that there should be no use of cluster bombs until governments can establish either that a technical solution is possible or that new restrictions and requirements regarding their use can be effective. In the event that cluster bombs are used in Afghanistan, they should not be used near populated areas. Landmines Afghanistan is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. In 2000 there was an average of 88 casualties due to landmines and unexploded ordinance reported each month (and doubtlessly many more casualties went unreported). Current landmine use by the Taliban and the United Front has been difficult to assess because of lack of access, but remains a serious concern.  The 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which went into effect in 1999, bans the use, production and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines. All members of NATO, except the U.S., Turkey and Greece, have ratified the treaty. Human Rights Watch calls on all parties to the Afghanistan conflict -- the U.S. and coalition forces, and Afghan forces -- not to use anti-personnel landmines. Even if a government is not a party to the Mine Ban Treaty, the use of anti-personnel landmines violates the prohibitions on the use of indiscriminate weapons contained in the Geneva Conventions and their Protocols, and under customary international law. Nor should states condone their use by allies or allow them to be stockpiled on their territory.  II. Impact on the Civilian Population  The population of Afghanistan has for years suffered extreme deprivations of food and health care and the absence of a civilian infrastructure, due to civil war and political repression. The onset of hostilities between the U.S.-led coalition and Taliban forces, as well as winter's arrival, are likely to exacerbate the situation, as thousands of civilians seek to move to safer areas and international humanitarian assistance is limited. Attacking forces must remain conscious of the precarious situation faced by the civilian population and take it into account when calculating the effect of attacks on any potential military target.  As you know, """"dual-use"""" objects are those that serve the needs of the civilian population and are also used by military forces. For example, certain roads, bridges and airports may ordinarily be legitimate military targets; in the case of Afghanistan they may also be essential to the delivery of humanitarian relief throughout the winter. In such circumstances, the harm incurred to the civilian population by attacking them would be disproportionate to the military advantage gained, and so would be prohibited under international humanitarian law. Similarly, electrical facilities, even if not part of a national grid, are needed for the long term functioning of civilian hospitals and other civilian needs. During the Gulf War, the destruction of Iraqi electrical power facilities may have diminished Iraq's military command and control or air defense capabilities, but it also crippled the civilian services, resulting in the shutting down of water distribution, purification and sewage treatment plants and specialized medical equipment, with ill consequences for the civilian population. In Yugoslavia, transformer and distribution facilities were specifically targeted so as to avoid long-term impact on the civilian population. In determining whether dual-use objects are valid military targets, the impact on civilians must be carefully weighed against the military advantage served; all ways of minimizing the impact on civilians must be considered; and attacks should not be undertaken if the civilian harm outweighs the definite military advantage. III. Rules of Engagement International humanitarian law requires precautions and choices where civilians are at risk from attacks. The duty to take all feasible steps to minimize injury to civilians and civilian objects requires commanders to choose the means of attack that will minimize incidental harm to civilians. Human Rights Watch concluded in its study of the air campaign in Kosovo that affirmative measures - greater care in attacking mobile targets, better target selection, restrictions on certain daylight attacks - could have been taken to reduce the level of civilian harm during those military operations. Identification of Mobile Targets During the air war in Kosovo, Human Rights Watch found that five of the ten worst incidents involving civilian deaths were air attacks on presumed Yugoslav military convoys or transportation routes that turned out to include large numbers of civilians. For instance, in April 1999 NATO aircraft repeatedly bombed refugee movements along the Djakovica-Decane road, killing more than seventy civilians. When attacking a mobile target, the attacker has a duty to ensure that it is a legitimate military target before attacking; in case of doubt, no attack should be launched. If military vehicles have intermixed with civilian convoys, the attacking force must still take fundamental precautions to focus their effort on the military targets.  Use of """"Smart"""" Weapons According to the U.S. military, most of the weapons used in the first days of the Afghanistan conflict have been precision-guided weapons (often called """"smart"""" bombs). Gravity (""""dumb"""") bombs (including cluster bombs) have also been in use.  In deciding whether to use precision-guided weapons, states have a duty to take all feasible steps to minimize injury to civilians and civilian objects. This requires commanders to choose the means of attack that will minimize incidental harm to civilians. Where a party to the conflict has precision weapons at its disposal, it is under a duty to use """"smart"""" rather than """"dumb"""" bombs in populated areas.  Daylight Attacks Attacks on dual-use targets or targets near populated areas should take into account the time of day. During the Gulf War and Yugoslavia, attacks on certain targets during periods of high civilian activity caused high civilian casualties. A mid-afternoon air attack on a bridge at Nasiriyah in southern Iraq in February 1991 resulted in scores of civilian casualties among those on the crowded bridge. A 1 p.m. attack with precision-guided weapons on the Varvarin bridge in central Serbia in May 1999, caused the deaths of nine civilians and the wounding of forty others who were attending the town market. Precautions should be undertaken to determine whether there is a time of day for attack that would minimize potential harm to civilians. Furthermore, Human Rights Watch calls on the United States and coalition governments to:  Publicly reaffirm your commitment to abide by international humanitarian law standards, particularly as they concern the protection of the civilian population.  Publicly provide and evaluate information on civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects.  Regularly examine targeting emphasis and weapons selection during the armed conflict and take whatever corrective measures are needed to minimize the effects on civilians of the use of military force.  Establish an independent and impartial body, competent to receive confidential information, that would investigate alleged violations of international humanitarian law, and recommend changes to targeting and bombing doctrine to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law.   Human Rights Watch would be pleased to discuss any of these matters with you in the future. Sincerely, Kenneth Roth Executive Director","","Arms, Cluster Munitions, Landmines"

The paper discusses in everyday language some of the complex legal questions that states involved in the campaign against terrorism must address. As this paper explains, governments may not use unlimited methods and means to pursue war, even a war against indistinct enemies. International humanitarian law, also known as the """"laws of war,"""" is designed in principal part to protect civilians and other non-combatants. Warring forces may not intentionally attack civilians and civilian facilities. Attacks on military targets must minimize harm to civilians and refrain entirely from attacks that would disproportionately harm civilians or whose effects would be indiscriminate as between combatants and civilians.  Despite the existence of an armed conflict, certain aspects of international human rights law also remain in force. Even in a state of emergency, it is unlawful to suspend some rights, such as the prohibition on arbitrary deprivation of life, the prohibition of torture, freedom of religion, and trial ex post facto.  The two bodies of law - humanitarian and human rights - can simultaneously govern different geographic areas. An armed conflict raging in one country would be governed primarily by international humanitarian law, while in another country the pursuit of criminal networks through traditional law-enforcement means would be governed by human rights law. Whether those who become the targets of the United States and its allies are viewed as criminals or as an enemy in wartime is not merely a rhetorical distinction, since it affects such basic matters as when lethal force can be used. This paper addresses various questions about the requirements of international humanitarian and human rights law and the interplay between the two.  Other issues addressed include: the use of force against non-state actors, assassinations, prisoner-of-war status, the prosecution of terrorism suspects, and international law constraints on methods of attack.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan, Global",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/16/ethiopia-government-attacks-women-lawyers","Ethiopia- Government Attacks Women Lawyers","Ethiopia: Government Attacks Women Lawyers","Human Rights Watch Letter","10/16/2001","The Prime Minister Mr. Meles Zenawi The Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia Addis Ababa, Ethiopia   Your Excellency,   We are writing to express our deep concern regarding the recent suspension from operation of the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association (EWLA), a leading local nongovernmental women's rights organization. We call for an immediate and unconditional reinstatement of EWLA.    On August 23, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association, the only organization actively engaged in advocacy work on women's human rights in Ethiopia, publicly criticized the Ministry of Justice for its failure to effectively investigate, arrest and prosecute the known perpetrator in an ongoing case of domestic violence.   On August 25, the Minister of Justice alleged that EWLA was suspended for """"engaging in activities different from those it was mandated by law"""" without substantiating its allegations. We understand that the EWLA has met all legal requirements for nongovernmental organizations in Ethiopia. Further the Minister of Justice unilaterally announced the suspension of the organization through local television, without making efforts to inform the staff of EWLA and hear their response. The Minister of Justice's decisions in this respect are arbitrary and contrary to the requirements of Ethiopian law.   Human Rights Watch is even more concerned that this is a direct attack on EWLA's rights to freedom of expression and association. Ethiopia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) in June 1993 and is bound to respect the rights enumerated in it.   Article 19 of the ICCPR provides in part that:    1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.   2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.   International law allows for restrictions of the right but only on limited grounds. None of these grounds were compromised by the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association's publicly criticizing the government for its failure to protect women victims of domestic violence. Therefore, the ministerial order suspending EWLA from future operations has no legal basis.   Twenty-four-year-old Hermela Wosenyeler has repeatedly reported being harassed and assaulted to the police over a period of eight years. Even as the police have refused to take her reports seriously, the threat to her and her family has escalated. In 2000, the assailant shot and severely wounded Ms. Wosenyeler. On two separate occasions, the assailant attacked her two sisters with a machete causing serious injuries to them. Despite receiving several complaints from Ms. Wosenyeler and her family, the police have failed to take any action. Instead, the assailant is free and continues to threaten and harass the Wosenyeler family.   The Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association sought to assist Ms. Wosenyeler by urging the Ministry of Justice to take the necessary steps to ensure that her attacker was brought to justice. After failing to obtain a positive response from the Minister of Justice regarding the Wosenyeler case, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association publicly criticized the government's inaction in a statement made by the organization to the local press on August 23. The Minister of Justice responded to EWLA's protests by issuing a ministerial order suspending the organization from operation two days later. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the ban of EWLA is a thinly veiled attempt to silence them for criticizing the government. In the weeks since August 25, when the government suspended the association and froze its bank accounts, the government failed to justify the ban.   The situation of women in Ethiopia is difficult. Women bear the brunt of familial responsibilities, including feeding their families even as they live in conditions of extreme poverty. The majority of women are unemployed and illiterate. Despite the existence of a constitutional prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of sex in Ethiopia, in practice, Ethiopian women suffer from severe discrimination and are the victims of physical and sexual violence.   Since its establishment in 1995, the Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association has worked to defend the rights of women in Ethiopia. EWLA has won the respect of civil society in Ethiopia for its record of providing timely and effective legal assistance to women victims of discrimination and abuse, particularly poor women who cannot afford to meet the costs of hiring lawyers to represent their cases. Through its advocacy initiatives in 2000, EWLA successfully influenced reform of the Ethiopian Family Law Code whose discriminatory clauses had for many years relegated women's status in the family subordinate to that of men. EWLA has also worked to raise gender awareness by educating women and men about the rights of women. Prior to its suspension, EWLA had established branch offices in different regions outside Addis Ababa where it is headquartered, with the aim of reaching many rural women. At the beginning of 2001, EWLA initiated a campaign to amend the Penal Code to ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are protected.   The Ethiopian government has failed to implement the laws that protect women from discrimination and abuse, particularly sexual and domestic violence. In February 2001, EWLA organized a massive protest against domestic violence in which hundreds of women marched to the Prime Minister's office demanding more police protection as well as prosecutions and punishment of the perpetrators of such violence. This was the first public act organized by EWLA to call upon the government to enforce its laws effectively to protect women victims of abuse.   Ethiopia has a long-standing record of targeting human rights organizations and activists, often accusing them of being partisan. The banning of nongovernmental human rights organizations is indefensible. Moreover, women typically face huge obstacles in seeking legal protection from domestic violence or in getting law enforcement authorities to take action against their batterers. Police and judicial authorities commonly dismiss domestic violence as a """"private"""" matter rather than a crime that requires urgent state action. Authorities often blame women victims of violence when they speak about the violence, hence some victims remain silent. It is critical therefore to support women's rights organizations, such as the Ethiopia Women Lawyers Association, that seek to address violence against women and to educate society and law enforcement authorities about these crimes. In doing so, EWLA serves as a useful """"voice of the voiceless"""" that should be left to speak out freely on behalf of abused women. In addition, human rights organizations must be free to monitor government actions and promote human rights. The Ethiopian Women Lawyers Association was established to defend and promote the rights of women as provided for in the Ethiopian constitution.   We urge you to ensure that the Ethiopia Women Lawyers Association and other human rights organizations in Ethiopia enjoy their rights to pursue their objectives freely without any arbitrary interference by the government. Human Rights Watch urges you to end impunity for perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence against women. In addition, we urge you to take more active steps to combat violence against women in Ethiopia, including enacting specific legislation addressing domestic violence.    Sincerely,    LaShawn R.

We urge you to intervene on his behalf to prevent a gross abuse of his rights.   According to the information we have received, Abubakar Aliyu was found guilty of stealing 32,000 naira and sentenced to the amputation of his hand. Two accomplices, both sixteen years of age, received sentences of fifty lashes with a cane and eighteen months in jail.   Amputation is an extreme form of corporal punishment, which is expressly prohibited by article 37(a) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Similarly, rule 17.3 of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice provides that """"juveniles shall not be subject to corporal punishment."""" More generally, article 19 of the convention guarantees the right of children to be free from all forms of physical or mental violence; relying particularly on this provision, the Committee on the Rights of the Child has found that any corporal punishment is incompatible with the convention (see Report on the Seventh Session, Committee on the Rights of the Child, U.N. Doc. CRC/C/34, Annex IV, September-October 1994, p. 63).   In fact, amputation and other forms of corporal punishment are impermissible under international law whether they are imposed on children or on adults. As the Special Rapporteur on Torture has observed, """"corporal punishment is inconsistent with the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment enshrined, inter alia, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment"""" (see Report of the Special Rapporteur, Commission on Human Rights, 53d sess., Item 8(a), U.N. Doc. E/CN.4/1997/7 (1997)).   The international legal obligation to protect all persons from torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment applies in all circumstances; a state may not invoke provisions of its domestic law to justify noncompliance with international law. In particular, the Special Rapporteur advises that """"those States applying religious law are bound to do so in such a way as to avoid the application of pain-inducing acts or corporal punishment in practice.   The imposition of a sentence of amputation on a fifteen-year-old is a particularly egregious violation of international law. We urge you to ensure that this inhumane sentence is not carried out.

In a new backgrounder released today, Human Rights Watch said that only two of Afghanistan's twenty-nine provinces are believed to be free of mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO). The most heavily affected provinces are Herat and Kandahar, the latter being the Taliban's chief stronghold. The provinces bordering on Pakistan and Iran, which are the most common destinations for refugees fleeing the country, are also heavily mined; they include Farah, Paktia, Kabul, Zabul, Ghazni, and Paktika. Even the capital, Kabul, is mine-affected.  """"Afghanistan is already one of the most heavily mined countries in the world, and the United States should not be making it worse,"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms division of Human Rights Watch. """"Landmines are indiscriminate weapons that will still kill civilians even if the Taliban is ousted.""""  Landmines may already kill or maim more civilians in Afghanistan than in any other country. In the year 2000, there were on average about eighty-eight recorded mine/UXO casualties per month. It is believed that the actual number of mine victims could be 50 percent to 100 percent greater, taking into account those deaths and injuries that go unreported. And the toll is likely to grow significantly with the rapid and chaotic movement into unfamiliar territory of civilians who fear U.S. airstrikes and military operations by the various Afghan forces.  Human Rights Watch has not been able to verify whether U.S. food drops have in fact landed in mined areas. But since Afghanistan has been heavily mined by various parties over two decades of war, the United States should take extra precautions to avoid mined areas.  While virtually all combatants in Afghanistan in recent decades are thought to have used mines, most were laid by Soviet and pro-Soviet Afghan government forces from 1979-1992. The Taliban claims to have stopped the use of antipersonnel mines in 1998, declaring it un-Islamic and punishable by death. There has been no credible evidence of use by Taliban forces since 1998, though some allegations have emerged in recent weeks. The opposition United Front are believed to be continuing their use of antipersonnel mines. """"Even if no new landmines are laid, efforts to demine the country will undoubtedly be scaled back for the duration of the armed conflict,"""" said Hiltermann. """"The grim reality is that the mine situation in Afghanistan can only be exacerbated by the current crisis.""""  A total of 142 countries have joined the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits the use production, stockpiling, and transfer of antipersonnel landmines under any circumstance and requires destruction of stockpiled and emplaced mines. On Tuesday, Algeria became the latest country to ratify the treaty, which has been ratified more quickly than any multilateral treaty in history. The United States has not joined.  As a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), Human Rights Watch is a staunch supporter of the call for a total ban on the use, production, stockpiling, and transfer of antipersonnel landmines. It serves as Coordinator of the ICBL's civil-society based verification initiative, the Landmine Monitor.","Asia, United States, Afghanistan","Arms, Landmines"

George W. Bush will travel to Shanghai next week for his first meeting with Jiang Zemin. Can the two leaders use the more cooperative atmosphere to make progress on other issues? Whatever its internal divisions and suspicions of American intentions, the Chinese leadership seems united on wanting to improve relations. To smooth the way for Mr. Bush's visit, Beijing has announced that it will buy 30 Boeing jetliners worth $1.6 billion. On Sept. 28, China released and expelled Wu Jianmin, an American citizen and former academic charged with spying. Other prisoners, including political and religious activists of concern to the United States, may be freed in the coming weeks. President Bush should use his talks with President Jiang to begin laying the groundwork for ongoing interaction between the two countries, aimed at making headway on key issues such as human rights. It would help if he took with him to Shanghai some leading members of Congress, including those who actively promoted China's entry into the World Trade Organization and who recognize the need for a modern legal system to ensure compliance with WTO obligations. They could offer U.S. funding for rule of law programs in China, and propose exchanges with their legislative counterparts on counterterrorism, curtailing corruption and money politics, and the role of civil society. There is need for frank discussion of the tensions between basic freedoms and security concerns. How are national security laws actually applied in both countries, what is the role of the courts, and how can fundamental rights be protected? The United States itself is now struggling with these dilemmas as it seeks to curb terrorism at home and abroad. Mr. Bush should acknowledge the difficulties facing his own administration since Sept. 11 as it deals with hate crimes and a wave of threats against Muslims and Arab-Americans. This gives him an opportunity to address protection of ethnic minorities, a major human rights concern in China. The Bush administration could propose a dialogue concerning the Internet. With millions already logging on in China, applying some 60 regulations restricting Internet access or imposing censorship is a threat to freedom of expression and an impediment to commercial development. Some U.S. companies are uncomfortable with laws requiring them to report to the Chinese police anyone who downloads politically sensitive material. An informal working group can be set up involving American Internet companies and NGOs. Mr. Bush should explain the U.S. interest in seeing China's reforms continue and expand, while encouraging greater adherence to international norms. He should emphasize that he has no interest in imposing U.S. """"values"""" or the American political system on China.

During the wave of post-referendum violence in East Timor in 1999, Annan warned that senior Indonesian officials risked prosecution for crimes against humanity if they did not consent to the deployment of an available multinational force. They quickly relented.  Annan has been criticized for the role he played as head of U.N. peacekeeping at a time when the international community failed to stop the genocidal slaughter of civilians in Rwanda and Srebrenica.

""""While we recognize that police have an obligation to maintain law and order, there are international law enforcement standards that set strict limits on the use of lethal force,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Palestinian Authority must ensure that its police force abides by them.""""  On the morning of October 8, Palestinian police confronted a crowd of over 1,000 students in Gaza City. The students were marching from the Islamic University to the Palestinian Legislative Council to protest U.S. air strikes against Afghanistan. According to eyewitness accounts, police initially tried to block the march by using tear gas and by beating demonstrators with batons. While the exact circumstances are unclear, police opened fire on protestors, killing Yusuf Mohammed Abd al Hadi (19) and Abdullah al Efranji (14), and critically wounding Haitham Tawfiq Abu Shammala (19). Mr Shammala is in the intensive care unit at Shifa Hospital in Gaza with a severe head wound.  After police opened fire, violent clashes ensued. More than fifty people were injured, including policemen, and several police stations and businesses were ransacked. The Palestinian leadership announced on October 9 that it would set up on an urgent basis a commission of inquiry to examine the events.  The most relevant international standard on police conduct is Article 9 of the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials (adopted by the Eighth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, Havana, Cuba, August 27 to September 7, 1990):  Law enforcement officials shall not use firearms against persons except in self-defence or defence of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury, to prevent the perpetration of a particularly serious crime involving grave threat to life, to arrest a person presenting such a danger and resisting their authority, or to prevent his or her escape, and only when less extreme means are insufficient to achieve these objectives. In any event, intentional lethal use of firearms may only be made when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.

The alliance is part of a broader emerging group that includes the former king, Mohammed Zahir Shah, other leaders from the dominant Pashtun ethnic group and even Taliban defectors.   As it supports local commanders, the United States should consider carefully the dismal human rights records of some of its new allies.   From 1992 to 1997, forces that are now part of the alliance shelled civilian neighborhoods in Kabul and looted, raped and killed civilians there and in other parts of the country.   Among the commanders whose forces were implicated in these abuses were Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek leader previously allied with the Soviet-backed government, Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, head of the Sunni Islamist party Ittihad-i Islami, and Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was assassinated on Sept. 9.   Here are examples of abuses committed by their forces:   On Jan. 5, 1997, planes belonging to General Dostum's militia dropped cluster munitions on residential areas of Kabul. Several civilians were killed and others wounded.   In March 1995, Massoud forces were responsible for rape and looting after they seized control of Kabul's predominantly Hazara neighborhood of Karte Seh.   On the night of Feb. 11, 1993, the Massoud and Sayyaf forces conducted a raid in west Kabul, killing Hazara civilians and committing widespread rape. Estimates of fatalities range from 70 to more than 100.   No Afghan commander from this period has been held accountable for violations of international humanitarian law. Nor has the alliance indicated any willingness to bring to justice any of its commanders.   Now accountability appears to have taken a back seat to expediency as America hastily assembles and supports a broad opposition to the Taliban.   Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld has indicated that the United States plans to provide forces opposing the Taliban in Afghanistan with financial and possibly military assistance. The alliance already receives military support from Iran and Russia, both of which seek to curtail Pakistan's extensive involvement in Afghanistan. Russia also fears Taliban support of Islamic insurgents in its former republics in Central Asia.   Some of the current air strikes appear aimed at Taliban front-line positions. Once these are destroyed, the alliance will face a relatively open road to recapture key cities such as Kabul, Herat on the border with Iran and Mazar-i-Sharif in the north.   If a violent transition takes place, there will be a great risk of ethnically targeted abuses. In the past two years the Taliban have carried out large-scale civilian massacres in parts of northern Afghanistan. They have destroyed homes, farmland and irrigation systems. With a narrow ethnic base rooted in the country's northern minorities, some of whom have directly suffered from these depredations, the alliance will be ill-placed to prevent reprisals by its forces against groups seen to havebenefited from Taliban rule.   The likelihood of increased abuses against minorities by the Taliban as its grip on power loosens is also high.   America and its allies ought to choose their Afghan allies carefully. They have the leverage to do so. If America provides unqualified material and political assistance to opposition forces, it could embolden commanders who have committed atrocities in the past.   The Bush administration has a profound interest in not portraying itself as aligned with brutal forces that may commit further abuses. If strong signals are sent now that human rights violations will not be tolerated, maybe Afghan civilians will have something good to look forward to.   Mr. Hiltermann is the Arms Division director for Human Rights Watch, whose Afghanistan researcher, Mr. Parekh, recently returned to New York from interviewing Afghan refugees in Pakistan.

In releasing a backgrounder on human rights abuse in Egypt, Human Rights Watch said that top Egyptian officials appear to be counting on the U.S. administration to overlook widespread torture, wholesale jailing of critics, and other forms of repression, as it builds a coalition to respond to the September 11 attacks.  """"If the U.S. ignores Egypt's human rights problems, that will not have a moderating effect on people in the region who are hostile to U.S. policies,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Many people in the Arab world already find Washington's human rights policies to be totally cynical. A closer alliance with the Egyptian government will not persuade them otherwise."""" Some 23,000 U.S. troops are embarking this week on long-planned military exercises in Egypt, code-named Operation Bright Star.  The Human Rights Watch backgrounder examines how more than two decades of emergency rule have stifled peaceful critics of the Egyptian government as well as those who advocate violence. Torture is widespread in Egypt, and basic liberties such as freedom of association and freedom of speech are sharply restricted. While Egypt could technically be called a democracy, the government frequently throws opposition candidates and their supporters in jail during elections.  The backgrounder also examines Egypt’s confrontations with Islamist political groups in the 1980s and 1990s, including al-Gihad, which is reportedly tied to Osama bin Laden.","Asia, Middle East/North Africa, United States, Afghanistan, Egypt",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/10/afghanistan-and-refugees-need-humanitarian-action","Afghanistan and Refugees- Need for Humanitarian Action","Afghanistan and Refugees: Need for Humanitarian Action","Statement by Human Rights Watch to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ","10/10/2001","Twenty years of civil war, political turmoil, continuing human rights violations and recent drought have already displaced more than five million of Afghanistan's population. Some four million refugees are displaced in neighboring countries and across the world, while another one million people are internally displaced within Afghanistan. Before September 11, severe drought had brought the country to the verge of famine and existing Taliban restrictions on relief agencies had severely hampered the delivery of assistance and civilian access to basic services.   Now that U.S. and British air strikes have begun, the humanitarian situation is even more urgent. Unfortunately, the recent strikes killed four workers involved in de-mining operations inside Afghanistan, which is considered one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. Landmines are concentrated in the border regions to which refugees are likely to flee. If the situation was bad for Afghan civilians, displaced persons, and refugees before the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington D.C, it only worsened in the three weeks afterwards. Conditions inside Afghanistan as of early October have deteriorated dramatically and aid agencies are warning of a humanitarian disaster of epic proportions.   The withdrawal of all international relief agency staff after the September 11 attacks when the Taliban declared that it could no longer guarantee their security has exacerbated an already dire situation. Border closures have severed the supply of aid into Afghanistan. At the same time the Taliban are reported to have confiscated food supplies from the United Nations and relief agencies and shut down U.N. communication networks. Many relief agencies report that they have been unable to contact their local staff since the September 11 attacks and thus information about conditions inside the country is scant. The World Food Program (WFP) warned shortly after the attacks that food supplies inside the country could only last two to three weeks. Limited food deliveries were resumed to the borders of northern and western Afghanistan at the end of September, but as of October 8, WFP announced that all food deliveries inside and outside the borders of Afghanistan had been stopped in response to the US military air strikes. Airdrops by the U.S. military of food and medical supplies have been met with skepticism by aid agencies outside the U.N. system, because of the lack of in-country staff to deliver the supplies and to properly administer medicines to needy populations.   After the September 11 attacks, fear of retaliatory military action and forced conscription by the Taliban, politically motivated attacks by the Taliban against particular ethnic groups believed to be sympathetic to the opposition, as well as the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan have caused tens of thousands of Afghans to flee, most of them towards Pakistan.   All six countries neighboring Afghanistan, including Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and China, officially closed their borders to refugees both on security grounds and citing an inability to economically provide for more refugees. Like Pakistan and Iran, Tajikistan's borders had been closed to Afghan refugees for the past year. Pakistan's actions were reportedly in direct response to a request from the U.S. to strengthen security in an effort to apprehend those responsible for the U.S. attacks. Although tens of thousands of refugees have been able to cross into Pakistan, thousands more - most of them women and children - have been trapped at the border with no shelter, food, water, or medical care. UNHCR has reported that several women have given birth while waiting to cross the border into Afghanistan.   While countries in the region do face legitimate security concerns at this time, measures must be found to address these concerns without denying refuge to those fleeing civil conflict, human rights violations, the fear of military threats and conscription, and the looming humanitarian crisis inside Afghanistan.   Host and donor governments, in collaboration with the United Nations, should keep all borders open to fleeing refugees in line with neighboring countries' international obligations, while simultaneously developing a coordinated strategy to effectively identify and separate militants and armed elements from civilian refugees.   Pakistan:   Pakistan is host to some two million Afghan refugees, and despite having officially closed its borders, many more Afghans are crossing into Pakistan each day. Pakistan's border with Afghanistan is 1,560 miles long, making it difficult to control. The current humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and impending U.S. military action has led to an increased influx of refugees, particularly at the Chanam border crossing near Quetta in Balochistan province. Approximately 15,000 refugees have reached the Chanam border; attempts to prevent thousands more Afghans from crossing have led to clashes between border guards and refugees. Concerned about deteriorating humanitarian and security conditions for refugees trapped at the Chanam border crossing, UNHCR was negotiating with the Pakistan authorities to allow the refugees entry into Pakistan. In a report on October 1, however, UNHCR stated that thousands of the refugees had left the border area, supposedly retreating back into Afghanistan and seeking other ways into Pakistan. Since then, each day several hundred refugees arrive in Pakistan via mountain roads, but as of October 8, Pakistan continues to officially refuse to re-open its borders. The Taliban have also established checkpoints along routes to Pakistan to prevent those without passports and visas from leaving the country.   UNHCR is preparing to provide relief to those fleeing the country and the Pakistan government has stated that it will provide assistance to those refugees who manage to enter the country. Some one hundred new refugee sites have been identified by the Pakistan authorities in the North West Frontier Province, which could accommodate up to one million people. The sites are located in what are known as Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas - largely lawless territories close to the Afghanistan border. The new sites lack adequate water supply and infrastructure and Human Rights Watch is concerned by reports that refugees may be held under detention-like conditions. Location of refugee camps in these areas could seriously endanger the well-being, safety and security of the refugees. International standards stipulate that refugee camps should be located at a safe distance from international borders to avoid cross-border attacks or military incursions and that refugees should not be held in detention-like conditions. In addition, all sites currently identified lack adequate water, an issue that promises to plague internally displaced and refugee populations throughout the region. On October 8, UNHCR offices were stoned and personnel were unable to travel to border regions because of demonstrations in Quetta and Peshawar. The UNICEF office in Quetta was burned by protesters, as were the offices of two NGOs working with refugees located in the northwest border regions.   Iran: Iran's frontier with Afghanistan is 560 miles long. In the wake of proposed U.S. military action in Afghanistan, Iran has closed its border expecting large numbers of Afghan refugees to attempt to cross. Iran has indicated that it wishes to provide humanitarian assistance only inside Afghanistan with the consent of the Taliban. To this end, seven refugee camps have been proposed for the border region between Afghanistan and Iran, but on Afghan soil. These camps will be designed to hold a maximum of 200,000 refugees between them. Iranian newspapers have reported that the interior ministry called upon Iranian relief organizations to provide emergency aid, although relief workers have so far reported that few refugees have reached the Iranian border. The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that the Iranian Red Crescent moved tons of relief items to the border in preparation for possible new arrivals. So far, Iran has not responded to calls from UNHCR or international NGOs to officially reopen its borders, although reportedly small numbers of refugees are being allowed to cross. Recent reports indicate that hundreds of Afghans seeking refuge from the military air strikes were unable to cross into Iran because of border closures. Iran has sent extra troops into the eastern border region to maintain security and keep the borders closed.  Tajikistan:   Recovering from its own 1992-1997 civil war, the situation in Tajikistan is still unstable. The war, which caused massive internal displacement, has compounded the country's problems. Tajikistan's frontier with Afghanistan has been closed since September 2000. The Tajikistan government, unable to adequately defend the border itself has been relying on thousands of Russian Federal border guards to guard its frontiers.   There are currently over 10,000 internally displaced Afghans on islands in the Pyanj River, waiting for an opportunity to cross into Tajikistan, some of whom receive assistance from aid agencies. UNHCR has estimated that as many as 50,000 Afghans in neighboring provinces close to the border may also leave their homes should the current crisis escalate. Other estimates put this figure as high as 120,000. On September 20, the President of Tajikistan, Emomali Rakhmonov, stated that the country would not be prepared to let a single refugee into the country. He cited a threat of infiltration by Islamic militants as well as serious economic problems as his major concerns.   China, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan: All three other countries have also closed their borders. China's relatively narrow border with Afghanistan is the least accessible route out of the country. Uzbekistan's frontier has been reinforced, with the government citing concerns about Islamic militancy as the justification. Turkmenistan's foreign minister indicated a willingness to work with UNHCR, although it is not clear whether this means that the border would reopen in the event of an influx of refugees. Policy Recommendations:   There is an urgent need for international cooperation to address the humanitarian crisis inside Afghanistan, to assist countries in the region to cope with large-scale refugee flows, and for western states to take their share of Afghan refugees. Countries should not use legitimate security concerns in the face of the September 11 attacks as an opportunity to close their borders or introduce legislation that further restricts the rights of all refugees, asylum seekers, migrants, or other non-citizens.   Afghanistan's neighbors should work quickly to establish procedures, in conjunction with UNHCR and donor governments, to separate armed elements from refugees. In this way they can keep their borders open and comply with their obligations under international refugee law, as well as their humanitarian obligations, while maintaining national security. Urgent steps should be taken to help these countries to cope with the potential mass influx of refugees.   Human Rights Watch makes the following recommendations.   To the Taliban authorities:  As a matter of urgency allow international relief and U.N. agencies full, free, and unimpeded humanitarian access to all civilians inside Afghanistan, including the internally displaced, with full security guarantees. Cease immediately the confiscation of humanitarian supplies from relief and U.N. agencies and restore to the extent possible full communication networks for U.N. and relief agencies.   To neighboring countries:  Re-open borders to refugees from Afghanistan and provide them with adequate protection.  The deportation of Afghan refugees must cease immediately.  As a matter of urgency and in collaboration with donor governments and United Nations agencies, develop a coordinated strategy to effectively identify and separate militants and armed elements from civilian refugees. Separation should take place inside host countries at the border and involve an international monitoring presence. The establishment of cross-border camps, safe havens, or humanitarian zones within Afghanistan should not be considered as an alternative to refuge in neighboring countries. Refugee camps should be established in safe, accessible areas in neighboring countries and located at a safe distance from international borders in accordance with international refugee protection standards. Camps should be set up in areas with adequate infrastructure and water supply and humanitarian agencies should have full, free and unimpeded access to the camps. Refugees should not be held in camps under detention-like conditions.  To governments in industrialized countries:  Continue to allow asylum seekers access to fair and efficient asylum determination procedures. Tougher immigration controls, including anti-terrorist and anti-smuggling measures, should not infringe on the rights of all asylum seekers to access fair and efficient asylum determination procedures, and should in no way undermine government's international obligations prohibiting arbitrary and indefinite detention and the return of refugees and asylum seekers to territories where their lives or freedom may be threatened. Urgent measures must be taken to counteract and prevent growing xenophobic and racist attacks against nationals, immigrants, asylum seekers, and refugees on the basis of their ethnic origin, nationality, religious and political beliefs and backgrounds. Increased protection should be provided to these groups, and government leaders should take the lead in countering racial, religious, or ethnic discrimination. Immigration control measures must include procedural safeguards in conformity with international standards for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers arrested, detained, and in the process of deportation.    To donor governments:  The Bush Administration's commitment of $320 million in immediate humanitarian aid both for refugees and the population inside Afghanistan is a good start, but clearly more is needed. International responsibility-sharing measures should be urgently put in place to respond to the humanitarian crisis inside Afghanistan and potential refugee flows.  Immediate humanitarian assistance must be provided to civilians inside Afghanistan to prevent further humanitarian disaster and options for ensuring that assistance reaches those most in need, especially the internally displaced, must be urgently explored. Urgently provide international assistance to neighboring countries and countries in the region to cope with the potential outflow of refugees from Afghanistan.  Governments outside the region, particularly industrialized states, should explore emergency resettlement possibilities for Afghan refugees.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

In north-central Afghanistan, ethnic Hazaras have been repeated targets of such violence and remain particularly vulnerable, Human Rights Watch said. The Hazaras are Shi'a Muslims, sharply distinguishing them from the militantly Sunni and mainly ethnic Pashtun Taliban.  Not only is there a possibility of continued attacks by the Taliban on Hazaras and other northern minorities, especially those considered sympathetic to the opposition United Front (Northern Alliance), but if Taliban rule ends violently, there may be opposition reprisals against ethnic Pashtuns and other communities seen as having supported the Taliban.

Once sixty countries ratify the treaty, the court will be established, most likely in 2002. Virtually every key U.S. ally and every member of the European Union strongly supports the creation of the court, and a number of European allies have expressed concern about the ASPA and the Bush Administration's endorsement of it.     """"The United States is forging a global coalition against terrorism, and the State Department has just endorsed a bill that authorizes an invasion of the Netherlands,"""" said Richard Dicker, Director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"This makes no sense.

This action could undermine U.S. credibility in forging coalitions against human rights abusers, Human Rights Watch said, and it will have no success in preventing entry into force of the treaty, since the pace of ratifications has already proven even faster than expected.     """"The American Servicemembers Protection Act is misnamed and ill-timed,"""" said Dicker.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/05/letter-colin-powell-icc","Letter to Colin Powell ICC","Letter to Colin Powell (ICC)","","10/05/2001","The Honorable Colin J. Powell Secretary of State U.S. Department of State Washington, DC 20520   Dear Secretary Powell: As you may know, Human Rights Watch has long supported the creation of the International Criminal Court as a tool that will strengthen respect for human rights around the world. We are well aware of the Bush Administration's concerns regarding the ICC, and understand that U.S. ratification of the Rome Treaty remains unlikely.   Nevertheless, we were profoundly concerned to learn of the State Department's support for the harsh, ill-conceived and ill-timed bill known as the American Servicemembers' Protection Act (ASPA), as expressed in a September 25th letter by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Paul Kelly to Senator Jesse Helms.   We understand that the Administration obtained waivers to some of the most onerous provisions of the bill, including those imposing sanctions on countries that ratify the ICC treaty. Nevertheless, Assistant Secretary Kelly's letter indicated not only support for this new version of the ASPA, but opposition to all conceivable alternatives - implying that the sanctions-based approach contained in that bill is indeed the Administration's preferred option.   If this not the case, then we urge you not to work for the adoption of this legislation. We also hope that the Administration's review of policy toward the ICC will soon make clear to the world a more constructive American approach to this emerging institution. Otherwise, the United States risks sending a signal that it is planning to punish dozens of countries for joining a coalition to hold accountable the perpetrators of crimes against humanity. Keep in mind that the coalition supporting the ICC includes every member of the European Union, virtually every major U.S. ally, and nearly every country the United States is seeking to enlist in the effort to bring to justice the perpetrators of the September 11th attacks. We sincerely hope that the message of the ASPA is not one you want to send to the world, particularly now.   In addition to its sanctions provisions, the legislation the State Department has endorsed also contains extraordinary language authorizing the President to use """"all means necessary and appropriate"""" to bring about the release from captivity of U.S. or allied personnel detained or imprisoned by or on behalf of the ICC. At a time when allies in Europe and around the world are rallying to stand with the United States against a common threat, the State Department should not be embracing legislation that authorizes an invasion of the Netherlands. True, such a prospect may seem remote and even ridiculous. But that is all the more reason not to dignify it with an endorsement.   The passage of the ASPA in whatever form is unlikely to prevent the establishment of the ICC. Just today, the United Kingdom became the forty-second country to ratify the ICC treaty. In the last week Nigeria, the Central African Republic and Liechtenstein have ratified, and several more ratifications are imminent. The European Union has adopted a legally binding Common Position mandating its member states to accelerate the treaty's early entry into force """"by raising the issues of the widest possible ratification, acceptance, approval or accession to the Rome Statute [...]."""" Indeed, the required sixty ratifications are likely to be completed by sometime next year.   Nor will adoption of the ASPA strengthen protections for U.S. service members in any practical way. Indeed, the hostility it may generate could well have the opposite effect for U.S. forces stationed overseas, increasing the possibility of politically motivated legal attacks in national courts. The only real impact this legislation can have is to diminish the credibility of U.S. efforts to forge coalitions against human rights abusers and to undermine future U.S. efforts to advance international justice in discrete cases, whether by leading NATO in arrests of war criminals in the Balkans, or bringing war crimes charges against Saddam Hussein.   We continue to believe that the United States can best address its concerns by staying engaged with allies in the process of establishing the court. That was the wisest course before September 11th. It is all the more imperative today, at a time when international cooperation to strengthen the rule of law has never been more important. We hope that is the course you and President Bush will choose, and we hope you will make that clear to those friends and allies of the United States who were troubled by the recent endorsement of the ASPA.

In a background paper released today, Human Rights Watch described fraudulent elections, media censorship, religious persecution, and abuses by security forces, among the country's most serious human rights problems. The Human Rights Watch backgrounder also outlines Tajikistan's complex regional politics, its 1992-1997 civil war, and its ties to Uzbekistan and Russia.  """"There's a great deal of political chaos in Tajikistan,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"But whatever the Tajikistan government can control, it controls with an iron fist.""""  The war, fought between a communist-led government and the United Tajik Opposition (UTO), a mix of Islamic and other political groupings, killed up to 50,000 people, crippled the economy, and left a legacy of political violence and chaos. The war and its political aftermath have dominated Tajikistan's ties to its neighbors, particularly Afghanistan and Uzbekistan.  During the war, the UTO was based in northern Afghanistan and enjoyed the support of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and Ahmad Shah Massoud, who until his death last month led the United Front opposition to the Taliban.  When the UTO and the government reached a peace agreement in 1997, some disgruntled UTO fighters joined the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan (IMU).  U.S. President George W.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/10/04/rwanda-elections-may-speed-genocide-trials","Rwanda- Elections May Speed Genocide Trials","Rwanda: Elections May Speed Genocide Trials","But new system lacks guarantees of rights ","10/04/2001","(New York) - The election today of more than 200,000 judges in Rwanda offers hope of speeding up trials resulting from the 1994 genocide, Human Rights Watch said today. But the innovative judicial system, called “gacaca,” may be subject to political pressures and lacks some basic internationally recognized safeguards, such as the right to legal counsel.  """"The system has flaws, but it provides the only real hope for trials in the foreseeable future for more than 100,000 persons now detained in inhumane conditions,” said Alison Des Forges, Senior Adviser to the African Division of Human Rights Watch.  Human Rights Watch urged the Rwandan government to rapidly complete the legislative and logistical steps needed to make the “gacaca” system operational, including a law on indemnization of victims.  In the first step towards creating a complex three-tiered system, Rwandans will elect panels of nineteen judges for each of some 11,000 jurisdictions. The judges are to be chosen by acclamation as “persons of integrity.” They are not required to have any knowledge of the law and will undergo brief but intensive training before beginning their unpaid service. “The new jurisdictions are likely to reflect local political dynamics,” said Des Forges. “Sometimes they will judge well, sometimes they will favor victims or the accused.”  If there are miscarriages of justice, neither party can call on legal counsel for help. Rwandan authorities assert that permitting parties to have access to legal counsel would distort a “popular” form of justice.  “Gacaca is not a purely popular form of justice,” said Des Forges. “The state has its role, with prosecutors preparing cases and giving advice to the judges, so the accused too should have the right to seek legal advice to defend himself.” Human Rights Watch called for intensive and sustained monitoring of the new system given the inherently political nature of the jurisdictions and the absence of the right to counsel for both victims and the accused. Background on Rwandan Judicial System Genocide trials have taken place in regular Rwandan courts since the end of 1996, but only 5,300 persons have been judged, fewer than 5 percent of those currently detained. Lack of personnel and resources as well as political considerations and corruption have hampered this system.  Long subject to international criticism for the slow delivery of justice and the inhumane conditions of detention, the Rwandan government faces other pressures to speed up trials. The issue of justice may figure importantly in political debate as the government moves towards national elections promised for 2003. Feeding the detainees is a major expense thus far shared with the international community, but foreign donors have indicated that the Rwandan government will have to assume an increasing share of this burden in the near future.  To deal with the huge backlog of cases, the government is establishing a new system that takes its name, gacaca, and its inspiration from a pre-colonial community-based system for resolving conflicts. But in contrast to the older system, this modern gacaca represents a hierarchical, state-directed initiative. Gacaca offers the hope of faster trials because so many more jurisdictions will be operating simultaneously throughout the country. But the new jurisdictions are unlikely to speed up the judicial process as much as is expected. Training the more than 200,000 judges and equipping jurisdictions with even minimal materials for record-keeping will likely require at least six months before the jurisdictions can begin to operate. The judges will work from case summaries prepared by the local prosecutor's office but the number of prosecutors has not kept pace with the growing number of jurisdictions. As a result, the productivity of the prosecutors will limit the speed of gacaca trials as it often has limited the speed of trials in regular courts.  The Rwandan genocide law provides for reduced sentences for those who confess their crimes fully and name all their fellow criminals. Some 16,000 persons have confessed but many of them have not yet had their declarations reviewed and approved by the prosecutor's office, a necessary step for the confessions to take effect. Although confessions will shorten the time needed for trials, investigations into the accuracy of the statements constitute yet another demand on the time of overburdened prosecutorial staff.  The most local jurisdiction, which of the cell, is to assign the accused to one of four categories according to the gravity of the crime he is alleged to have committed. Those placed in category one, the most serious, may not benefit from the confession procedure to obtain a reduction of sentence; they must be tried in regular courts rather than gacaca proceedings; and they alone may be sentenced to death if found guilty. Although the accused can appeal trial judgments, they are not allowed to appeal their assignment into a given category.  An informal system of gacaca has been carried out in Rwandan prisons and lockups since 1999 at the order of the Minister of Justice. Not regulated by any uniform procedure, these sessions have been carried out in different ways in different prisons at different times. Results of these sessions have been entered into the case files of the accused but it is unclear what if any control has been exercised over the material thus gathered in order to verify its accuracy. In several cases reported to Human Rights Watch, accused persons alleged that gacaca sessions in the prisons reached blatantly false conclusions in response to pressure from authorities. Rwandans have already begun asking government officials whether gacaca jurisdictions will also treat accusations of serious crimes committed by soldiers of the government army in 1994 and after. Authorities have replied that such cases can only be treated in the regular court system, a response which has generated discontent among some who would like to see those accused of these crimes also brought before popular justice.","Africa, Rwanda","International Justice"

In fact, few knew anything about the two Central Asian countries; they have been far off the radar screen of American foreign policy. As Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld arrives in Uzbekistan today to seal the new alliance, one can only hope the Bush administration's understanding of the region's Soviet-era relics advances as quickly as its embrace of them. President Bush first hinted at Central Asia's role in his Sept. 20 address to Congress, when he named the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan as an ally of Osama bin Laden. The IMU, based in Afghanistan and Tajikistan, poses a genuine armed threat to Uzbekistan and its neighbors. But since 1997, the Uzbek government has used the threat to justify a total crackdown on """"independent"""" Muslims -- those who pray at home, study the Koran in small groups, belong to peaceful Islamic organizations not registered with the state or disseminate literature not approved by the state. The government has sentenced thousands of these Muslims to jail terms as long as 20 years without connecting them to the IMU or to any violent acts. Some of those targeted are members of the Hizb-ut-Tahrir (Party of Liberation), a group that supports the reestablishment of a caliphate, or Islamic state, by peaceful means. Some are independent imams who ran afoul of authorities by preaching without deference to a government-run religious board, by not praising the government in their sermons or by refusing to be informants. Hundreds of those who attended these imams' sermons are also in prison. Those arrested endure the worst torture -- hanging by their feet or wrists, beatings with bottles filled with water, electroshock or rape --often for months on end. Meanwhile, wives and mothers are subjected to Soviet-style hate rallies, at which neighbors are assembled to denounce them as """"enemies of the people."""" President Bush has said eloquently that the struggle against terrorism cannot become a war against Islam. Yet America's closest ally in Central Asia is undeniably waging war on virtually any form of Islam not controlled by its ruthless state, potentially undermining one of the president's core strategic objectives. How long will it be before the sons and brothers of peaceful Muslim believers now in prison opt for violence? What if Uzbeks turn their resentment not only on their abusive regime but against the Americans stationing forces on their soil? What if Uzbekistan or its equally repressive neighbors then turn to the United States for help in putting down an escalating internal threat -- real or perceived? The challenge for the United States will be to ally itself with Uzbekistan without aligning itself with Uzbekistan's policies. A good way would be to include it on a list of countries that violate religious freedom -- a list the State Department has repeatedly delayed releasing to avoid offending its allies. U.S. officials should meet with the brave few remaining Uzbek human rights defenders, and publicly urge the release of religious prisoners. And they should remember that Uzbekistan already has its own interest in countering bin Laden. Its cooperation should not have to be bought with the unconditional economic rewards the Bush team is reportedly considering. If Uzbekistan balks, the United States can answer with words the president has suggested: """"You are with us or against us. And if you are with us, you will not play into the hands of the terrorists by alienating vast numbers of peaceful Muslim believers."""" America's answer should never be: """"Either you are with us or we will pay you to be with us."""" The key is to see Central Asia not merely as a staging ground for battles fought elsewhere but as a proving ground for principles on which an effective battle against terrorism depends. One principle should still be that smart governments distinguish between those who commit acts of terror and those guilty of nothing more than sharing their religion.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan",""

Human Rights Watch called on Rumsfeld to make clear that Uzbekistan should not read its new relationship with the U.S. as a green light to add further abuses to its already abysmal rights record.  “If the United States is going to ally itself with Uzbekistan, it has to find a way to avoid aligning itself with Uzbekistan’s brutal policies,” said Tom Malinowski, Washington Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch.  Uzbekistan, which became an independent state in 1991, has retained much of its Soviet legacy. It has no independent political parties, no free and fair elections, and no independent news media. Torture and police brutality are widespread. Most vulnerable are political dissidents and religious Muslims who worship outside state controls.  “President Bush has said the war on terrorism cannot become a war on Islam,” Malinowski said. “The government of Uzbekistan is undeniably at war with forms of Islam it does not control.”  The government of Uzbekistan, led by President Islam Karimov, has waged a merciless four-year campaign against non-violent religious Muslims who practice their faith outside state controls. Citing the threat of “Islamic extremism,” authorities have arrested, tortured, and convicted thousands of these independent Muslims: men who attended sermons of state religious leaders who later fell out of favor, men who prayed at home or in small private groups, and those who belonged to unregistered Islamic organizations or possessed religious literature not sanctioned by the state.  Few of the estimated 7,000 independent Muslims sitting in Uzbekistan’s prisons today were accused of participation in any violent act, while thousands of peaceful Muslims were locked up for holding beliefs or worshiping in ways the state disapproves.  Human Rights Watch has called on the U.S. government to condition further assistance to Uzbekistan on improvements in its rights record.  “Uzbekistan already has its own interest in countering Osama bin Laden,” Malinowski said. “The United States shouldn’t have to buy its cooperation with unconditional rewards.”","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, United States, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan","Religious Freedom"

The report, titled The 'Sixth Division': Military-Paramilitary Ties and U.S. Policy in Colombia, charges that Colombian military and police detachments continue to promote, work with, support, profit from, and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and compatible with their own.  The 'Sixth Division' is a phrase Colombians use to refer to paramilitary groups, seen to act as simply another part of the Colombian military. The Colombian Army has five divisions.  At their most brazen, the relationships described in this report involve active coordination during military operations between government and paramilitary units; communication via radios, cellular telephones, and beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the names of suspected guerrilla collaborators; the sharing of fighters, including active-duty soldiers serving in paramilitary units and paramilitary commanders lodging on military bases; the sharing of vehicles, including army trucks used to transport paramilitary fighters; coordination of army roadblocks, which routinely let heavily-armed paramilitary fighters pass; and payments made from paramilitaries to military officers for their support.  Human Rights Watch urged the Colombian government to enforce effective measures to cut these ties and punish the officers responsible, after investigations carried out by civilian courts. President Andrés Pastrana has publicly deplored paramilitary atrocities. But the armed forces have yet to take the critical steps necessary to prevent future killings by suspending high-ranking security force members suspected of supporting these abuses, Human Rights Watch said.  """"President Pastrana has recognized the problem, but the military has yet to take the appropriate measures to solve it,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. """"This has serious implications for Colombia's international military donors, especially the United States.""""  Based on months of investigation, including two missions to Colombia and interviews with victims, witnesses, and investigators, the report also addresses U.S. policy toward Colombia. Human Rights Watch contends that the U.S. has violated the spirit of its own laws and in some cases downplayed or ignored evidence of continuing ties between the Colombian military and paramilitary groups. Among the recipients of U.S. aid is a unit implicated in a serious abuse.  The report also analyzes the impact of President Bill Clinton's decision, in August 2000, to waive human rights conditions attached to the Colombia aid package.  """"When the United States waived the human rights conditions that applied to security assistance to Colombia, it sent a direct message to Colombia's military leaders that overshadowed any other related to human rights,"""" Vivanco said. """"Put simply, the message was that as long as the Colombian military cooperated with the U.S. anti-drug strategy, American officials would skirt their own human rights laws.""""  In the report, Human Rights Watch focuses on three Colombian Army brigades:  Twenty-Fourth Brigade: Human Rights Watch has collected evidence showing that in 1999 and 2000 the Twenty-Fourth Brigade, based in the state (department) of Putumayo, actively coordinated operations with paramilitaries, and some officers in charge of troops received regular payment from paramilitaries for their cooperation. This relationship persisted even as the U.S. planned and implemented its """"push into southern Colombia"""" in the region under Twenty-Fourth Brigade control. The Colombian counter-narcotics battalions created with U.S. funds and trained by the U.S. military, actively coordinated with the Twenty-Fourth Brigade, using its facilities, intelligence, and logistical support during this effort.  Third Brigade: Building on evidence set forth in previous reports, Human Rights Watch has collected new information that the Third Brigade, based in Cali, Valle, has continued to promote, coordinate with, and assist paramilitaries in southwestern Colombia. According to testimony that Human Rights Watch collected, Third Brigade officers maintained constant communication with paramilitaries in the field using cellular phones and radios. Soldiers also reportedly """"moonlighted"""" as paramilitaries, and paramilitaries stayed on military bases and used military transportation. Witnesses told Human Rights Watch that soldiers also threatened civilians by telling them that paramilitary forces would follow Colombian Army troops and carry out atrocities in their wake.  Fifth Brigade: The area under the jurisdiction of the Fifth Brigade, based in Bucaramanga, Santander, was the scene of a recent and successful paramilitary offensive. Paramilitaries seized control of over a dozen towns along the Magdalena River, meeting virtually no resistance or even response from the Colombian security forces. Paramilitaries made their first-ever bid to conquer a major city, Barrancabermeja. Even as paramilitary fighters take over whole neighborhoods and issue threats, local military and police authorities remain largely passive, using excuses to elude responsibility for taking effective action.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""

President Boris Trajkovski promised an amnesty for former members of the ethnic Albanian rebel National Liberation Army as a key element of the peace process that Macedonian and ethnic Albanian leaders commenced in August. While not opposing the amnesty, Human Rights Watch argues against immunity for war crimes.  “If peace in Macedonia is going to endure, the perpetrators of serious violations on both sides to the conflict must be brought to justice,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. “The amnesty should not prevent accountability for those most serious crimes.”  Human Rights Watch has investigated several cases of serious NLA abuses against civilians. In June 2001, NLA forces detained and tortured eight elderly ethnic Serb civilians from the village of Matejce, who were subjected to mock executions.  On August 7, 2001, uniformed members of the NLA kidnapped for several hours three road construction workers, who were severely beaten and sexually abused. There have also been allegations of kidnappings, expulsion of civilians, and destruction of religious sites by the NLA.  Human Rights Watch also renewed its calls on the Macedonian government to investigate violations by its own security forces and ethnic Macedonian paramilitaries. In particular, the group urged investigation of an August 2001 attack on the village of Ljuboten, in which the police shot dead six ethnic Albanian civilians.  Noting that the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague has jurisdiction over gross violations of international humanitarian law committed during the Macedonia conflict, Human Rights Watch underscored that the Macedonian government has primary responsibility for holding violators on both sides to the conflict accountable.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

The Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) Amendment Bill makes registration for NGOs harder and allows suspending NGOs that do not conform to any “government policy or plan.” It gives the government wide-ranging powers to interfere with NGO work and suspend associations. NGO leaders can be imprisoned for up to one year if they breach the proposed law. Normal political party activity is illegal in Uganda, and opposition supporters have been harassed and arrested in recent months.  “Given how constrained political life is in Uganda, it is all the more important that civil society be able to act freely,” said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor at the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. “This is a bad law, and we hope parliament rejects it.”  The bill will be one of the first challenges faced by the new parliament, which was elected in June this year.  “The proposed law potentially criminalizes civil society organizations instead of recognizing their enormous contribution to the social, political and economic life in Uganda,” said Des Forges. “The parliament should draft a new NGO law instead, that aims at building a constructive relationship between the state and civil society.”  The NGO bill would replace an already restrictive NGO law. In a briefing entitled “Freedom of Association At Risk” released today, Human Rights Watch analyzes the current law as well as the new bill. “Both the current law and the proposed bill violate the right to freedom of association guaranteed under international law. As party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Uganda is bound to those standards,” added Des Forges.

President Shevardnadze begins a five-day visit to the United States today. In a letter sent yesterday, Human Rights Watch drew President Bush’s attention to the escalating group violence against Christian worshippers of non-Orthodox faiths in Georgia. The attacks are growing in frequency and ferocity due to police complicity and the government’s failure to prosecute those responsible. Human Rights Watch also urged President Bush to question President Shevardnadze’s record on combating torture. In 1999, President Shevardnadze’s appointees supported the derailment of reforms to the criminal procedure code that aimed to curb the widespread practice of torture by Georgian police. Minor improvements to that law enacted this year fall short of a commitment to end torture.  “President Bush should make it clear that the new global fight against terrorism will not close the U.S. government’s eyes to mob beatings of peaceful religious worshippers,” said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “If Georgia wants to be considered a serious long –term partner it has to enforce the rule of law.”  Human Rights Watch has received reports of three mob assaults on non-Orthodox Christian groups in the last week alone. On September 28, Georgian police reportedly stood aside to allow a mob of 100, armed with clubs and stones, to erect a roadblock on a highway leading out of the capital, Tbilisi. The mob stopped buses and cars transporting some 100 Jehovah’s Witnesses to a religious convention, dragged them out, kicked and beat them. They injured up to forty people, nearly a dozen of them seriously. The mob then attacked the convention site in the town of Marneuli, ransacking and burning property, injuring more people, and firing shots into the air. Police not only failed to intervene to stop the assaults, but allegedly confiscated film and a video camera from Jehovah’s Witnesses, and verbally derided them. On September 23, a mob attacked an evangelical church service in Tbilisi, reportedly injuring sixteen worshippers. On September 30, a group of approximately fourteen men reportedly attacked a Jehovah’s Witness prayer meeting in the town of Rustavi.  The Georgian authorities know the perpetrators of many of the mob attacks, which have been growing in intensity for two years. Vasili Mkalavishvili and other leaders make frequent media appearances, openly broadcast their planned attacks, and claim that they receive support from the police and security services. None of the leaders has been arrested for their role in any of the attacks.  On August 29 Human Rights Watch published a 14-page memorandum documenting the growing official intolerance of non-Orthodox Christian groups in Georgia, and the escalation of mob violence against them. The memorandum called on the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom to visit Georgia and investigate.  President Shevardnadze’s visit to the United States comes a week after the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a highly critical resolution detailing Georgia’s failure to honor human rights obligations it assumed upon joining the organization in 1999, and urging major reforms to bring the country into line.","Europe/Central Asia, Georgia","Religious Freedom"

The Cairo West airbase could be an important forward-supply base for attacks on Afghanistan. For more than two decades Egypt has been one of the largest recipients of U.S. economic and military aid, second only to Israel. For fiscal year 2002 the Bush Administration has requested $ 1.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing funds, $ 655 million in Economic Support Fund assistance, and $1.2 million for training of Egyptian military officers. Egyptian officials appear to be banking on this strategic linkage to deflect attention from the country's poor human rights record. President Hosni Mubarak told an interviewer recently that human rights arguments should not be put forward on all occasions, and that those who carry out terrorist acts have no claim to human rights. Prime Minister Atef Abeid lashed out at U.S. criticism of torture and unfair trials in Egypt. """"After these horrible crimes committed in New York and Virginia"""", he said, """"maybe Western countries should begin to think of Egypt's own fight against terror as their new model"""". Model of Abuse The Egyptian model has included non-stop emergency rule ever since President Mubarak took over in October 1981, after the assassination of Anwar Sadat. Following a resurgence of political violence in the early 1990s, the government introduced anti-terror laws giving the security and intelligence services greater powers of arrest and detention and rounded up thousands of suspects. While fiercely suppressing opposition political activists, the authorities attempted to gain the support of the country's conservative religious establishment by delegating to them the authority to censor artistic expression, intellectual debate touching on matters of religion, and social mores. The state of emergency enables the authorities to arrest people deemed """"a threat to national security and public order"""" and hold them without charge for prolonged periods, even years. The state also uses emergency rule to refer civilian defendants to military courts or to exceptional state security courts, in effect creating a parallel court system under direct government control. Since 1992 hundreds of civilians, mostly alleged members or supporters of al-Gihad (Holy Struggle, known abroad as Egyptian Islamic Jihad), al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (Islamic Group), or the Muslim Brotherhood, have been referred to military courts. These trials, sometimes held en masse, fail to meet international fair trial standards: basic rights, such as the right to appeal, have been routinely violated, even in cases where the defendants faced and were punished with the death penalty. These measures have been used widely against Egyptians attempting to exercise peacefully basic political rights like freedom of association or freedom of expression, as well as persons accused of committing or advocating acts of violence. Having crushed much of its Islamist political opposition by the mid-1990s, and with many of the leading figures of such groups in prison or in exile, the government widened its security net, further eroding basic civil rights. Non-governmental organizations, professional associations, the media, trade unions and political parties - all have had their work hampered by laws aimed at silencing them and increasing governmental control over their activities. One recent high-profile example was the Supreme State Security Court conviction of sociology professor and democracy advocate Saadeddin Ibrahim in a politically motivated trial. He was sentenced to seven years; five of his associates also received prison terms, and his Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies was forcibly closed down. Ibrahim is critical of the Islamists, but has also spoken out about election irregularities, treatment of minorities, and other sensitive topics. Torture in Egypt is widespread and systematic. Security forces and the police routinely torture or ill-treat detainees, particularly during interrogation. In his January 2001 report to the Commission on Human Rights, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture cited thirty-two cases of death in custody, apparently as a result of torture, occurring between 1997 and 1999. Confessions extracted under torture are commonly used as evidence in political trials and form the basis for convictions. Victims of torture have no effective remedy and little opportunity for redress: most apply for and get financial compensation from civil courts, in effect an admission on the part of the authorities that torture has taken place. But very few victims can convince the authorities to institute criminal proceedings against their torturers: in the handful of such cases reaching the courts in recent years almost all resulted in acquittals or derisory punishments. While reports of torture of political detainees have decreased recently, torture of ordinary criminal offenders in police stations remains rife. A widening net of repression The government does not provide information on the number of detainees held in prisons and other places of detention, but there is reason to believe that thousands continue to be held in connection with real or suspected membership of banned Islamist groups. Many are held under administrative detention -- in other words, without trial -- and in some cases have been held for more than ten years. Among them are individuals who were arrested as children in their early teens and who remain incarcerated as adults. Others were kept in prison though their sentences had expired. Others were never released even though acquitted in court, such as Abd al-Mun'im Gamal al-Din Abd al-Mun'im, a freelance journalist with the bi-weekly newspaper al-Sha'b. He has remained in detention since 1993 even though he was acquitted twice (in 1993 and 1999) of all charges by military courts. Many detainees have successfully challenged the legality of their continued detention before administrative courts, but Ministry of Interior officials routinely ignore court rulings and continue to hold detainees in harsh conditions, depriving them of all contact with the outside world for long periods. The 1992 Anti-Terror Law also criminalized non-violent political opposition, and was used to arrest and bring to trial persons not accused of committing or advocating violence but simply of alleged affiliation with the Muslim Brotherhood. Since 1995, over one hundred defendants were tried and dozens sentenced to terms of up to five years after being convicted of membership in an illegal organization. In 1999 the government arrested and tried twenty alleged Muslim Brothers, mostly lawyers, university professors and other professionals, accused of membership of an illegal organization and attempting to control the activities of professional associations. The prosecutions appeared to be an attempt by the authorities to prevent the defendants from running as independent candidates in parliamentary elections and for the boards of their respective professional associations. In November 2000, the Supreme Military Court sentenced fifteen of the defendants to prison terms ranging between three and five years, and acquitted the rest. The government has also targeted other Islamist opposition groups seeking to exercise their political rights peacefully. In May 2000 the Political Affairs Committee, a government body responsible for licensing and monitoring political parties, froze the activities of the legal Islamist opposition Labour Party. This step, ostensibly taken because of a leadership dispute within the party, was widely perceived as an attempt to silence government critics ahead of parliamentary elections. A ban on the party's publications remains in force despite several court rulings in its favor. In a separate case in April 2000, four leading Labour Party figures were imprisoned after being convicted for slandering a government minister. As part of its efforts to stifle free political participation, the government strictly limits the number of licensed political parties. Since 1996, for example, Muslim Brotherhood affiliates who formed a group known as al-Wasat (The Center) have repeatedly applied to register as a political party but without success. This partly accounts for the overwhelming number of candidates who run as independents in Egypt's parliamentary elections. As an added measure to ensure a comfortable victory for the ruling National Democratic Party in these elections, the government routinely arrests opposition candidates and their supporters in the run-up to elections. The primary target has been the Muslim Brotherhood, hundreds of whose members and supporters were rounded up and held in administrative detention ahead of and during the October-November 2000 parliamentary elections in what has become a regular feature of Egyptian democracy. The pattern repeated itself in the run-up to the mid-term Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Council, the upper house of the parliament) elections held in May and June 2001, when at least 140 persons suspected of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood were arrested for days or weeks, including several candidates running as independents. Emergency legislation prohibits strikes, public meetings, and election rallies. The government has taken arbitrary measures to stifle the voices of trade union activists who have been outspoken around issues such as worker safety in the state sector. In some cases the authorities issued threats to persuade activists to withdraw their candidacy in union elections. In October 2000 Fathi al-Masri, a board member of Center for Trade Union and Workers Services (CTUWS), an independent NGO, was detained for a month on charges of """"disturbing public order"""" after he distributed leaflets criticizing medical services at a state-owned company. In September 2001 two other CTUWS board members, including its director, Kamal Abbas, were questioned by prosecutors regarding """"unwarranted"""" criticisms of working conditions at another company. The government controls the electronic media and on occasion has shut down newspapers and periodicals that cross red lines. The Press Law of 1996 provides jail terms for offences such as defamation, insult or libel. The government has gone out of its way to appease Islamist sentiment in the country by implementing and encouraging measures that in practice violate of freedom of expression. These include banning novels considered to be sexually explicit or denigrating to Islam, and prosecuting writers whose views are deemed blasphemous. In effect, the government has compensated for its repression of Islamists in the political sphere by allowing the conservative religious establishment, such as the leading figures in Al-Azhar University, to exercise a high degree of control over cultural expression and social mores. In May 2001 the authorities arrested a group of fifty-two men for alleged homosexuality. In a trial that began in July, they were charged with committing """"obscene behaviour,"""" and two of them also faced additional charges of """"contempt for religion."""" Their trial before the Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanours allows for no right of appeal upon conviction, and the court has declined to investigate statements by some of the defendants that they had been tortured to obtain confessions. They face prison terms of up to three years on the """"obscenity"""" charge, and five years on the """"contempt for religion"""" charge. Islamist groups and political violence The two major Islamist groups associated with acts of political violence in Egypt are al-Gihad one of the groups named by the U.S. as connected with Osama bin Ladin's al-Qa'ida network and al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya. Both seek to establish a state based on their interpretations of Shari'a law in place of the military-dominated republic that has ruled since 1952. Al-Gihad, which first became known in 1978, apparently has its roots among activists who became dissatisfied with the quiescent approach of the Muslim Brotherhood, perhaps the oldest Arab political-religious organization, founded in Egypt in 1928. The Brotherhood was banned in 1954 following the attempted assassination of then-president Gamal Abd al-Nasser by some of its more radical adherents. It remains under official ban to this day, although under Presidents Sadat and Mubarak it has been permitted to operate, within varying but often sharp limits on its activities, and to extend its influence within Egyptian society. One of the leading figures associated with al-Gihad was Shaikh Omar Abd al-Rahman, who is currently serving a life sentence in the U.S. after his conviction in 1995 for conspiracy to carry out bomb attacks in New York (including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing). In October 1981, al-Gihad claimed responsibility for the assassination of President Sadat. In the ensuing trial before the State Security Court, five of the scores of defendants linked to al-Gihad were sentenced to death. Ayman al-Zawahiri, today reputed to be a close associate of Osama bin Laden, was sentenced to three years in prison for his part in the assassination. (Interpol issued an arrest warrant for al-Zawahiri on September 25, 2001, in the wake of the September 11 attacks.) Shaikh Omar Abd al-Rahman, also arrested, was acquitted. In 1984, more than 300 alleged members of al-Gihad were convicted, and some subsequently executed, for killing security force personnel during clashes in the southern province of Asyut. Further clashes took place in al-Fayyum, southwest of Cairo, in April 1989. Among those arrested was Shaikh Omar Abd al- Rahman. He was released, pending trial, in August that year, but fled Egypt shortly thereafter and settled in the United States in 1990. Beginning in 1992, Egypt arrested thousands of persons and tried hundreds accused of membership of banned organizations -- various Islamist groups -- and, in some cases, acts of violence. In addition to al-Gihad, these included al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, which made its appearance in the early 1980s and whose members also regarded Shaikh Omar Abd al-Rahman as their spiritual guide. Another, Talai' al- Fatah (Vanguards of the Conquest), is believed to be an offshoot of al-Gihad. Egyptian officials claimed that members of these groups had received financial assistance from Iran as well as military training at camps in Sudan, and Pakistani-run camps inside Afghanistan. Some were also said to be veterans of the war in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation. According to information compiled by the non-governmental Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR), 1,357 people were killed in acts of political violence in Egypt between 1992 and 1998. Al-Gihad, which operated mainly in the Cairo area, targeted senior government officials and military personnel. Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya carried out many of its attacks in the governorates of Asyut, Minya and Qena, targeting police, security and military personnel as well as scores of civilians, including Coptic Christians. Tourists were also targeted, the most notorious case being the killing of fifty-eight foreigners and four Egyptians at the site of the temple of Queen Hatshepsut in the town of Luxor in November 1997, for which al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya claimed responsibility. Both Islamist groups also targeted various professionals, among them writers, journalists, academics, and members of the judiciary, some for their condemnation of acts of political violence, and others because they were deemed to be 'atheists' or 'secularists.' Among several acts of violence perpetrated outside Egypt was an attempt on the life of President Mubarak in Addis Ababa in 1995, for which al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya claimed responsibility. The government's campaign against those suspected of involvement in acts of political violence has been characterized by widespread arbitrary arrests, grossly unfair trials, torture, and executions. The Law to Combat Terrorism (No. 97 of 1992), subsequently incorporated into Egypt's Penal Code, gives extensive powers to police and the security forces. Thousands - the precise number is not known - were arrested in and around Cairo and in several provinces known to be Islamist strongholds. They were commonly interrogated under torture before being referred to prosecution officials or released. The majority was held in preventive detention without charge, while hundreds were convicted in mass trials before military courts, deemed by the government as more amenable to issuing guilty verdicts. Among other things, officials did not want a repeat of trials such as the 1984 State Security Court trial where judges acquitted a number of defendants in the Sadat assassination case on the grounds that confessions had been extracted under torture. More than a thousand defendants were tried before military courts in thirty-two separate cases between 1992 and 1998, according to the EOHR. Of these, 479 were alleged members of al-Gihad, of whom thirty-seven were executed, 277 imprisoned, and 165 acquitted. Others included 383 alleged members of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya; fifty-one of them were executed, 247 imprisoned, and eighty-five acquitted. None had the right to appeal their sentences before a higher tribunal, a fair trial requirement, and none of the officials they accused of having tortured them were ever brought to justice. The last major military trial of this kind was held between February and April 1999, involving 107 defendants, 60 in absentia. Most were charged with membership of an illegal organization (al-Gihad), as well as other charges including conspiracy to commit murder, weapons possession, and forging official documents. Several had been arrested the previous year in Albania, reportedly in connection with a planned attack on U.S. interests there. Several other defendants had been extradited from Bulgaria, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Libya. The Supreme Military Court sentenced nine to death, among them Ayman al-Zawahiri in absentia. Seventy-eight were sent to prison and twenty were acquitted. As in previous cases, a number of defendants stated in court that they had been tortured. In July 1997 five members of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyyas leadership issued a statement from Tora Prison, where they are currently serving prison terms, calling for a halt to violence. With the exception of the killings at Luxor, this directive has been largely adhered to and has been reiterated on several occasions since. As a result, several thousand Islamist detainees have been released since 1998, most of whom had been held without trial.","",""

""""President Putin has tried to use the events of September 11 to get carte blanche for the conduct of Russian federal forces in Chechnya,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The E.U. can't allow this to happen.""""  Human Rights Watch has documented very serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by federal forces in Chechnya, including summary executions, torture, forced disappearances, and indiscriminate bombing. The E.U. has been a principled critic of abuse in the two-year old conflict. It sponsored resolutions two years in a row at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights condemning these abuses, as well as acts of terror committed in relation to the conflict. The resolutions also called for the Russian government to investigate and punish the perpetrators, and for U.N. investigators to visit the region.  President Putin is also due to meet with NATO General Secretary Lord Robertson. In a letter to Lord Robertson, Human Rights Watch urged that any discussion of Russia's membership in NATO make clear that Russia would have to comply with the alliance's standards-including respect for the laws of war.  """"NATO has to ask itself-is it prepared to have among its members a country whose armed forces are implicated in such serious abuse?"""" said Andersen. """"Russia would have to clean up its armed forces before it could meet NATO standards.""""  Abuse continues in the conflict in Chechnya. In response to attacks by Chechen forces this summer, Russian federal forces conducted a series of sweep operations in three villages that involved the arbitrary detention of hundreds of villagers. Many were tortured, and several were the victims of extrajudicial execution or forced disappearance. In July 2001, Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 100 victims and eyewitnesses of these abuses.

Human Rights Watch called on governments to take stronger measures to protect children from abuse and urged the United Nations to undertake an international study of violence against children. The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child is meeting today in Geneva for a special day of discussion devoted to violence against children.  """"Children are at risk of violence in nearly every aspect of their lives-in their schools, on the street, at work, in institutions, and in areas of armed conflict,"""" said Jo Becker, Children's Rights Advocacy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"They are beaten, tortured, sexually assaulted and murdered, often by the very individuals responsible for their care and safety.""""  The study draws on investigations in twenty countries, which included hundreds of interviews with children subjected to violence or abuse. It found that in many cases, abuses are perpetrated by individuals in government employ, or occur in institutions-such as schools or orphanages-under the direct control of government.  """"Children are frequently victimized twice. First by the violence they endure, and then again by the failure of governments to bring their abusers to justice,"""" said Becker. """"Governments must start taking this phenomenon seriously.""""  Human Rights Watch found that in countries including Bulgaria, Guatemala, India, Kenya, Pakistan, and Russia, children frequently experience violence at the hands of police and other law enforcement officials. Children are often detained by police without sufficient cause, and then subjected to brutal interrogations and torture in order to elicit confessions or information. Street children are especially easy targets. They are beaten by police in order to extort money, and street girls may be forced to provide sex to avoid arrest or to be released from police custody. In Kenya, Guatemala and India, street children have been killed in extrajudicial executions.  Once placed in juvenile and criminal correctional institutions, children are frequently mistreated and abused, enduring severe corporal punishment, torture, forced labor, isolation, restraints, sexual assaults, and harassment.  In many countries, including the United States, children may be detained with adults, leaving them at increased risk of physical and sexual abuse. In schools, intended to nurture the development of children, violence may be a regular part of a child's experience. In many countries, corporal punishment is still permitted as part of school """"discipline."""" Human Rights Watch investigations in Kenya found that children were subjected to caning, slapping, and whipping that resulted in bruises, cuts, and humiliation, and in some cases serious injury or death. In South Africa, Human Rights Watch found that girls were at particular risk of sexual violence from both teachers and male students, and may be verbally degraded, fondled, assaulted and raped. Students may also be targeted because of their gender, race, ethnicity, religion, nationality, caste, sexual orientation, social group, or other status. In the United States, students who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender have been beaten, kicked, spit on, cut with knives, strangled, thrown against lockers, and dragged down flights of stairs.  Child laborers often endure long hours and grueling labor under difficult and harmful circumstances. In India and Egypt, Human Rights Watch found that child laborers were often beaten for working too slowly, making mistakes, or simply as a means of intimidation.  Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of children who have been orphaned or abandoned are placed in orphanages and other non-penal institutions. Dependent on the state for care, many instead experience shocking and sometimes deadly levels of abuse and neglect. Human Rights Watch found that in Russia, children were beaten, sexually abused, restrained in cloth sacks or tethered to furniture, and subjected to degrading treatment by staff.  In armed conflict situations such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Colombia and, Sierra Leone, children are killed, maimed, raped, and tortured. Hundreds of thousands of children recruited as soldiers risk injury, disability and death in combat, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their fellow soldiers and commanders.  Children who have fled war zones as refugees are also at risk. In Guinea and Tanzania, Human Rights Watch found refugee children vulnerable to physical abuse, sexual violence, and cross-border attacks.  Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to conduct an international study on violence against children and present a clear action plan to eliminate violence against children. It also urged all governments to ensure that all forms of violence against children are prohibited by law, and that abuses against children are vigorously investigated and perpetrators brought to justice.","Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Guatemala, Kenya, India, Pakistan, Bulgaria, Russia, Egypt, Global","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

On September 26, after one-day trials, the provincial People's Courts in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces imposed six- to twelve-year sentences on fourteen ethnic Jarai and Ede men for their alleged role in mass protests in February 2001, when thousands of Montagnards held protest marches in provincial towns. The demonstrators called for religious freedom, an end to encroachment on their traditional lands, and the establishment of an autonomous zone.  The men were the first to be tried in connection with unrest in the highlands, where the situation continues to be tense. The police and military presence has been high and foreign media and international observers have largely been banned from the region. The only official coverage of the trials was an announcement of the verdicts after they had taken place, and no diplomats or foreign press were allowed to attend.  """"The speed of the trials and the fact that the public had no advance notice gives real cause for concern that the defendants were denied basic protections, such as the right to legal counsel,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"We are concerned these men were deprived of their fundamental right to a fair trial.""""  According to the official state press, defendants were charged with """"destabilizing security"""" under Article 89 of the Vietnamese Criminal Code. They were accused of having formed a """"reactionary organization"""" in order to establish an independent state and a separate religion in the Central Highlands. One defendant was also charged with illegal possession of military weapons. In addition, Bom Jana -- identified as the """"mastermind"""" of the unrest -- was found to have chaired a founding ceremony of an """"illegal organization"""" in September 2000.  """"The right to a public hearing is one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial,"""" said Demelza Stubbings, Southeast Asia researcher for Amnesty International. """"These trials may well represent another effort by the Vietnamese government to stifle freedom of expression, assembly and association among Vietnam's dissenting highland population.""""  Land conflicts have increasingly become a problem in the Central Highlands provinces of Gia Lai, Dak Lak, Kontum, and Lam Dong, which have been flooded by an influx of lowland Vietnamese and ethnic minorities from other parts of Vietnam since 1975. The Evangelical Protestantism followed by most of the indigenous highlanders is also suppressed by the government, which forbids minority Christians from gathering in churches and pressures them to renounce their faith.  Political trials in Vietnam are routinely unfair, with defendants usually not permitted to call or question witnesses, and lawyers for the accused being allowed only to plead for clemency on their clients' behalf.","Asia, Vietnam",""

Amidst the intensive coverage of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington and the west’s preparations for a military response, there have been suggestions in the media that Osama Bin Laden’s Al Qaida organisation may have recruited and trained children for military actions.  CNN, for instance, carried archive footage purportedly taken from a training camp in which boys who appeared to be 10 or 11 were participating in military training exercises with Al Qaida fighters. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers has monitored patterns of child recruitment in Afghanistan and Pakistan closely[2], but has seen no evidence of Al Qaida using child soldiers.   Nevertheless, the current crisis has highlighted once again the continuing use of child soldiers by Taleban and United Front forces in Afghanistan and associated Islamist groups in neighbouring Pakistan.  It can be expected that the current military crisis could see unprecedented levels of conscription and mobilization of children. In addition, under-18s recruited into western military forces, including from the United States and United Kingdom, could also be at risk of deployment. Context Children have been used as soldiers by all warring factions throughout 20 years of resistance and civil war in Afghanistan.  Two generations of Afghan children have been raised in a highly militarised ‘kalashnikov culture’:  in schools both inside the country and refugee camps, textbooks and teaching methods have used images of tanks, guns and bullets in mathematics and reading classes.  Some informal Islamic schools or madrasas, have emerged as centres for indoctrination and recruitment of young fighters. Recruitment of children The Taleban has in the past shown extreme sensitivity to reports that it uses child soldiers and has strenuously denied such recruitment.  Taleban representatives told a visiting Danish delegation in November 1997 that """"all men aged over 18 can become soldiers"""" and that there is no conscription.[3]  In 1998, the Supreme Leader of the Taleban, Mullah Mohammad Omar, decreed that any followers who are too young and who are not yet growing a beard must leave his fighting militia. He warned that anyone violating this order would face severe punishment.[4] While this directive relates recruitment to puberty and physical appearance in Islamic terms, it still allows the possibility of under-18 recruitment.  There have been many reports of children and adolescents being recruited by the Taleban, although no estimates of total numbers are available.   In 1999, after UNICEF warned that there were increasing numbers of child soldiers in the Taleban’s ranks, the UN Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, made a report to the Security Council in which he noted that the """"Taleban offensive was reinforced by 2,000 to 5,000 recruits, mostly emanating from religious schools within Pakistan, many of them non-Afghans and some below the age of 14"""".[5]  The Taleban reacted strongly to the report and insisted on taking UN officials to the frontline to see for themselves that the claim was untrue. On 1 December 1999 Erik de Mul, the head of the UN’s humanitarian mission in Afghanistan, visited the front-line and reported no evidence of children being used to fight; the only child he saw was a cook.[6]  However, reports of child recruitment continue to emerge, particularly in connection with madrasas or religious schools in Pakistan. When they first became party to the civil war in 1994, the Taleban recruited mainly among young Afghan refugees attending madrasas in Pakistan. (The term Taleban signifies ‘students’.)  Progressively, as the conflict has receded in Taleban-held areas, recruitment takes place within Afghanistan, but the Taleban continue to draw recruits from networks of madrasas in Pakistan sponsored by various Islamist parties and groups. Where once these institutions were confined largely to the border regions, today they are spread throughout the country (even in urban centres of Punjab and Sindh) and not only draw from the Afghan refugee diaspora. UN sources indicate that recruitment to the Taleban is usually voluntary, with occasional conscription when additional forces are needed. A Danish fact-finding mission in 1997 was told that local communities were told to supply a given number of able-bodied men, whom they would be responsible for selecting themselves or buy an exemption for the equivalent of USD 200-300 per person. [7]  An Afghan aid worker based in Pakistan reported in 1999 that """"each land-owning family was required to provide one young man and 2.4 million Afghanis (about USD 500) in expenses. Each draftee can expect to spend two months fighting every 6 to 12 months.""""[8]  In January 1997, the Taleban reportedly faced a revolt over forcible recruitment in Kandahar, Wardak and Paktia provinces, with Taleban recruiters killed or driven out of villages.[9] Taleban representatives have denied there is conscription and maintained that recruitment is on a voluntary basis only.  In the traditional style of lashkar or tribal militias, individual commanders are responsible for recruiting soldiers, paying and maintaining them in the field. Local mullahs and shura heads participate in recruitment campaigns, delivering rousing speeches to attract recruits.  Soldiers are reportedly not paid beyond their keep and there is no set length of service, with considerable rotation amongst family members.  They are reportedly free to leave their units, although anyone that deserts in combat could face detention or flogging. The Deputy Governor of Jalalabad said that there was no actual enrolment or central roll of soldiers, but that commanders knew who was in their units. [10] According to some NGO staff in Pakistan, no girls have been recruited by the Taleban, but there have been reports of forced marriage of girls from Shamali and Mazar.[11]  The madrasa system Many madrasas are legitimate, informal educational institutions, serving poor students with few alternative educational opportunities.  But some networks of madrasas are run by different religious sects, political parties and factions affiliated to warring factions in Afghanistan, Jammu and Kashmir – and potentially dissident or terrorist organisations active further afield.  In February 2000, Pakistan’s Interior Minister claimed that only “one per cent” of madrasas in Pakistan sent their students for military training in Afghanistan.[12]  But the Pakistan Government has recognised the problem, particularly as madrasas feed sectarian violence in Pakistan itself as well as neighbouring conflicts.  In April 2000, the Interior Minister warned that sectarian parties were “spreading poison” and “polluting the minds” of children:  “All their madrasas, inappropriate literature, weapons and their activities will be stopped.” The Pakistan Government began work on a law to regulate and monitor these schools and the establishment of a Religious Education Board was mooted.  But these moves were expected to falter in the face of fierce opposition from the religious parties which had similarly blocked a tightening of the blasphemy laws.  Through its administration of zakat tithes the Pakistan Government has been an important conduit of financial support to the madrasas, but many of the schools have independent sources of income through their links to international Islamist networks. Military recruitment in Afghanistan is often cyclical, with large scale recruitment drives associated with significant defeats or major offensives and the turn of the seasons.  According to the UN Special Mission in Afghanistan, the Taleban and United Front (Northern Alliance) have a typical strength of 30-40,000 fighters on each side.  Both can mobilise approximately 80-100,000 soldiers during crisis periods, but these force levels are difficult to sustain.[13]  For instance, Samiul Haq, a Taleban supporter who runs a network of large madrasas in Pakistan boasted that many of his students had joined the Taleban after its defeats in the north in May 1997.[14]  In November 2000, the Coalition was told by reliable sources with access to the northern areas of a major new recruitment drive in the Panjshir Valley and Badakshan as the military position of United Front forces worsened in the face of a major Taleban offensive. [15] It can be expected that the current military crisis, with impending attacks by western forces and the assassination of United Front commander Ahmed Shah Masood, could see unprecedented levels of conscription and mobilization. Madrasas sponsored by networks which support the Taleban will periodically close (eg for holidays) and send students for military service (presented as a form of jihad and, therefore, part of their religious obligation and education). Many of these students return after one or two months ‘experience’ and are not used on the frontline but rather to police urban centres and checkpoints, thus freeing more experienced manpower for the front. (It has been suggested that this is one reason journalists and other visitors observe an apparently higher incidence of child involvement in Taleban forces.)[16] Amnesty International reported one such case of a man who filed a petition in the Sindh High Court in Karachi, Pakistan, after his 13-year-old son was reported missing while he was studying in the local Jamia Islamia school. The father accused the principal of the school of having sent his son to fight in Afghanistan without consulting the parents. The school finally admitted that the young boy left to fight in Afghanistan, supposedly of his own volition. The boy returned one month later saying that he had been persuaded by the nazim of the school to go to Afghanistan. Some 600 other juveniles were reportedly taken in buses to Afghanistan on the same day. The father withdrew his petition after the Pakistan police registered a criminal case, although no investigation was made and no one was arrested.[17] Foreign groups and neighbouring conflicts Throughout the resistance to the Soviet Union and subsequent civil war, many Afghan factions were joined by fighters from Wahabbist networks in countries of the Middle East and North Africa and sometimes even further afield.  Osama Bin Laden, for instance, was reported to have brought a brigade of 400 fighters from various countries to Afghanistan during 1999.[18]  Many of these fighters have also subsequently been inducted into armed groups fighting in the secessionist conflict in neighbouring Jammu and Kashmir.  This transnational recruitment has been one of key factors behind the current compact between Bin Laden and the Taleban (and by extension, some would argue, Pakistan’s intelligence services).[19] There are reportedly also connections between Afghan factions and armed groups fighting in neighbouring countries.  Child soldiers were extensively used by both sides during the civil war in Tajikistan, and there have been reports of cross-border recruitment by the United Front forces of Ahmed Shah Masood.[20]  The Islamic Movement of Uzekistan has reportedly received training in Afghanistan and includes boys under 18 in its ranks.[21]  Russian military sources claimed on 11 September 2001 that Chechen rebels receiving training in Kundiz and Balkh provinces included many children aged 15 to 17.[22] While little information is available, most foreign recruits are likely to be more mature, having received higher levels of indoctrination and training and sometimes served previously in Afghanistan, Kashmir or other conflicts.  Children are also less likely to be used in sensitive terrorist or cross-border operations.   Armed groups fighting in Jammu and Kashmir, for instance, might identify prospective recruits at the age of 15 or 16 (often from poor and disadvantaged familes), but they are generally over 18 by the time they infiltrate Indian-controlled Kashmir or engage in operations, given the high value of such cadres after they have received sophisticated training.[23]  In May 1999, Reuters reported  on 250 young recruits at a Lashkar-e-Taiba camp in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir:  “The training is divided into three stages:  21 days of small weapons training, wildnerness skills and fitness.  The boys are then sent home, where they are monitored by party elders to see if they are spiritually and physically fit enough to continue.”[24]  This pattern was confirmed by Kashmiri government sources who reported only a few instances of teenage infiltrators being intercepted as they crossed the line of control.[25]  In April 2000, however, Kashmir’s first suicide bomber turned out to be just 18 years of age.[26] For their part, the government armed forces of Pakistan and India both recruit volunteers at 16, but claim there is no deployment before 18 due to extended training periods. Child recruitment by western powers The use of child soldiers is not confined to the developing world or countries wracked by armed conflict. Of the 19 NATO members, 13 countries recruit under 18s into their military forces.  Of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, only Russia does not recruit below age 18. The United States of America accepts volunteers from the age of 17 years and until now has deployed 17 year olds in operations such as the Gulf War, Somalia and Bosnia.  The United Kingdom accepts voluntary recruits from age 16;  there are currently 6000-7000 under-18s in the British armed forces.  The UK is also the only European country which routinely sends under-18s into battle, including during the Gulf War. Both the United States and the United Kingdom have signed (but not yet ratified) the new Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, but it remains to be seen whether this will effectively change current policies on recruitment and deployment. International standards The new Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, adopted by the UN General Assembly in May 2000, prohibits governments and armed groups from using children under the age of 18 in hostilities; bans all compulsory recruitment of under 18s; and raises the minimum age and requires strict safeguards for voluntary recruitment. Article 4 of The Optional Protocol also provides:  “armed groups that are distinct from the armed forces of a State should not, under any circumstances, recruit or use in hostilities persons under the age of 18 years.”  It requires States Parties to take “all feasible measures to prevent such recruitment and use, including the adoption of legal measures necessary to prohibit and criminalise such practices.” Pakistan announced it would sign the Optional Protocol during the UN General Assembly Special Session on Children in September 2001.[27]  This event was postponed in the current crisis, and the status of Pakistan’s commitment remains unclear. UN Security Council, in its resolutions 1261 and 1314 on children and armed conflict, called for concerted international action, including by regional groupings, to stop the use of children as soldiers.  In his report to the Security Council in August 2000, the UN Secretary General called upon Member States “to consider taking measures to make any political, diplomatic, financial, material or military assistance for State or non-state parties to conflict contingent on compliance with international standards that protect children in armed conflict.”  While the UN Special Mission on Afghanistan has reported on human rights violations against children, the UN Security Council has not to date addressed this aspect in its resolutions on Afghanistan. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), in Resolution 16/9-C on Child Care and Protection in the Islamic World adopted in Dohar, Qatar in November 2000, called for “the non-involvement of (refugee) children in any armed conflict and not to enlist them in the armed forces or for any other actions which may expose their personal safety and security to danger”,  It called for “the convening, at the earliest possible date of the Ministerial Conference on the Child and Social Affairs, and commission(ed) the Secretary General to make the necessary consultations with the member states in this connection, particularly those which have outstanding expertise in this field.” Two major conferences organised in Asia and the Middle East by the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers issued strong political declarations against the military recruitment of children in each region.  The Kathmandu Declaration of May 2000, inter alia, called upon “Asia-Pacific States and States outside the Region to use their influence to bring pressure to bear on any government or armed group which recruits or uses children as soldiers by refraining from providing them, whether directly or indirectly, with arms, military equipment, training, personnel, safe haven, and other measures including bringing such use to public attention and making leaders accountable for their actions”.  The Amman Declaration of April 2000 called on states of the region to “criminalise” the recruitment and use of child soldiers and “not to supply small arms or light weapons to any government or armed group which recruits or uses children as soldiers, and to take steps to prevent individuals and companies from doing so.”  Recommendations To UN Security Council  integrate specific measures for child protection into its political actions on Afghanistan, including by incorporating action to stop child recruitment into any sanctions regime; Task the UN Special Mission on Afghanistan with monitoring the recruitment of children and deploy child protection advisers with any future UN peacekeeping or humanitarian operations;  To all governments  End all political, financial and material support, including by private networks and institutions, to armed forces and armed groups that recruit and use children for military purposes; Sign and ratify the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict; Ensure there is no deployment of under-18s with military forces involved in response to current crisis; Support donor action in Pakistan to regulate the madrasa system and bolster education and employment opportunities, particularly for vulnerable children in refugee diaspora and tribal areas; Convene the foreshadowed OIC Ministerial Conference on Child and Social Affairs to develop a comprehensive plan of action for child protection in the current crisis; Grant refugee status to children under 18 fleeing persecution in Afghanistan including possible military recruitment;  To the Government of Pakistan  publicly denounce the use of children as soldiers or operatives by all armed forces and armed groups; sign and ratify the Optional Protocol without reservations and take effective steps to criminalise underage recruitment by non-state actors and prosecute those responsible; deploy police to monitor madrasas during the current situation, particularly any signs of closure and movement of students; introduce comprehensive legal standards for madrasa schools including public registration by age of all students and strict prohibition on all military training and recruitment; grant refugee status and protection to children under 18 fleeing persecution in Afghanistan, including military recruitment; restrict the movement of children under 18 out of Pakistan unless accompanied by their guardians and for an verifiable civilian purpose.     [1] Amnesty International, Children in South Asia:  Securing their Rights;  ASA 04/01/98;  April 1998 [2] Coalition representatives conducted field research in Pakistan in November 2000.

Plainclothes security officials abducted Zahran on a Cairo street on September 20, and the next day prosecutors ordered him held for fifteen days without charges.  Zahran, 44, who runs Al Mahroosa publishing house, is a leading member of the Coordinating Committee of the Egyptian People’s Committee for Solidarity with the Palestinian Uprising (EPCSPU). The EPCSPU has called for a demonstration on September 28 to mark the end of the first year of the current Palestinian uprising.  Zahran is the first political activist to be arrested by the Egyptian government since the September 11 attacks in the United States. Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the government would use the anti-terrorism campaign to silence critics of government policy, citing President Mubarak’s recent remark that “human rights arguments should not be put forward on all occasions.”  “We hope that Mr. Zahran’s arrest is not the first in a new wave of repression against people trying to express peacefully opinions the government doesn’t want to hear,” said Joe Stork, Washington director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The government should release him immediately.”  According to eyewitness accounts, Zahran was abducted by plainclothes personnel of the State Security Intelligence (SSI – Mabahith Amn al-Dawla) shortly after midday outside the al-‘Ogail store on al-Tayaran Street in Cairo’s Madinat Nasr district. They drove him to his home nearby, where they seized papers and personal belongings. He was held overnight in SSI headquarters on Lazoghly Square.  The next day, the State Security Prosecution (Niyabat Amn al-Dawla) ordered Zahran held in preventive detention for fifteen days without formal charges. Lawyers who attended the interrogation told Human Rights Watch that Zahran was accused of disseminating tendentious information aimed at disturbing public order, and planning public marches and demonstrations. The prosecution authorities failed to clarify which legislation formed the basis for these accusations. An SSI official phoned Zahran on September 19 and summoned him to SSI headquarters, but then postponed the meeting to the next day outside the al-‘Ogail store. Zahran had asked a fellow EPCSPU member to accompany him as a measure of protection, but when that person arrived, eyewitnesses said that plainclothes SSI personnel had already taken him away.  Zahran suffers from diabetes and a serious heart condition, and his family has expressed fears for his health. Zahran’s wife told Human Rights Watch that when she enquired about him at SSI headquarters the night of his arrest SSI officials informed her that he was not being held there. On September 25, she was able to visit him at Mazra’at Tora Prison after much difficulty. She gave him a further supply of medicines but he had not as yet had access to a doctor.  “The authorities must ensure that persons in their custody are treated humanely,” Stork said. “Farid Zahran should get whatever medical attention he needs without further delay.”  BACKGROUND The EPCSPU, set up in Cairo in October 2000 by Egyptian human rights activists and other professionals, currently has several hundred members. Its aims are to generate support for Palestinians under Israeli occupation, and to provide foodstuffs and household goods to offset hardships stemming from the clashes that began a year ago.  On September 10, 2001, the EPCSPU participated in a large demonstration in al-Tahrir Square comprising representatives of opposition political parties and trade unions. The demonstration, held amid tight security, coincided with the end of a two-day meeting of Arab foreign ministers discussing Israeli policy towards Palestinians. Reuters reported that the gathering was largely peaceful; some demonstrators burned U.S. flags and raised placards condemning U.S. support for Israel and calling for a boycott of U.S. goods. When EPCSPU members and other demonstrators attempted then to march to the nearby U.S. embassy to deliver a letter of protest, security forces prevented them from doing so and severely beat several, according to eyewitnesses.  In the autumn of 2000, hundreds of Egyptians, mainly university students, took to the streets to protest the government’s perceived acquiescence to U.S. policy regarding Israel and the Palestinians. Many were rounded up and held for days without charge, and over twenty were held for weeks in preventive detention. Following their release, several reported that they had been beaten while in SSI custody and, in at least one case, severely tortured.  The arrest of Farid Zahran takes place against a backdrop of serious erosion of basic civil rights for Egyptian citizens. Under emergency rule, the government can arrest people at will, detain them for extended periods—even years—without charge, shut down publications, and ban public meetings.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt",""

Human Rights Watch has documented how police and agents from the National Security Service (the successor to the Uzbek KGB) hang criminal suspects and political detainees by their feet or wrists, beat them with batons or bottles filled with water, apply electroshock to their bodies, and rape or threaten to rape them.

Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians have fled towards the Pakistani border in recent days, while others are moving toward Tajikistan and Iran. All six countries bordering Afghanistan - Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and China - have officially closed their borders to Afghanistan.  Pakistan's actions were in direct response to a request from the U.S. to strengthen security in an effort to apprehend those responsible for the attacks. Western governments, including the U.S., Australia, and European Union member states, are also tightening immigration controls in a way that could further deny protection to Afghan refugees.  Despite border restrictions, some 15,000 Afghan refugees have entered Pakistan in the past week, most of them arriving in Balochistan province on the southwest border. A further 5,000 Afghan refugees who were massed for several days at the Chaman border crossing near Quetta finally entered the country and are now encamped on the Pakistan side of the border. The Iranian government, while reiterating that it is unable to admit any new refugees, has offered to assist Afghans through cross-border assistance operations. """"Afghanistan's neighbors face real security concerns at this time,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director at Human Rights Watch. """"But these countries have international obligations to meet their security concerns by screening out armed elements so that borders remain open for refugees.""""  Human Rights Watch also opposes the establishment of camps inside Afghanistan, or the creation of so-called """"safe havens.""""  """"Past experience from Bosnia, Rwanda, and Northern Iraq tells us that 'safe havens' have proved to be anything but safe,"""" said Reilly. """"Instead, any refugee camps established should be outside the territory of Afghanistan.""""  Afghan civilians now face three serious problems, Human Rights Watch said. First, the border closures by Afghanistan's neighbors mean that people fleeing Afghanistan have nowhere to go for protection. Second, the withdrawal of international relief agencies will jeopardize food supplies in a country already facing famine. And third, Afghans with a valid fear of persecution seeking asylum overseas, particularly in Western countries, may face prolonged immigration detention or deportation.  In order to safeguard the lives of Afghan civilians and refugees, Human Rights Watch makes the following urgent recommendations:  All neighboring countries and countries in the region should reopen their borders to refugees from Afghanistan; As a matter of urgency, host and donor governments, and United Nations agencies should develop a coordinated strategy to effectively identify and separate militants and armed elements from civilian refugees. Separation should take place inside host countries at the border and involve an international monitoring presence; Camps, safe havens, or humanitarian zones within Afghanistan should not be established. Instead, all refugees should be permitted into neighboring states; Governments outside the region, particularly industrialized states, should explore emergency resettlement possibilities for Afghan refugees; Tougher immigration controls in countries outside the region, particularly industrialized states, should not infringe on the rights of all asylum seekers to access fair and efficient asylum determination procedures, nor should they result in arbitrary or indefinite detention, or the return of asylum seekers and refugees to countries where they face persecution; Donor governments should urgently provide international assistance to neighboring countries and countries in the region to cope with the potential outflow of refugees from Afghanistan; and Donor governments and international relief agencies should take all steps possible to ensure that adequate humanitarian assistance reaches all affected civilians inside Afghanistan, especially the internally displaced.Conditions inside Afghanistan are deplorable. Twenty years of civil war, continuing human rights violations under the Taliban regime, and severe drought have already created a fragile situation with many on the verge of starvation. As many as one million people are internally displaced within the country and thousands more have fled Kabul and Qandahar in the past days.  The departure of all international aid staff after last week's attacks in the U.S. leaves Afghanistan's civilian population in an even more vulnerable condition. The World Food Program has estimated that it only has enough food supplies to last two to three weeks - a total of 3.8 million people are reliant on food aid in the country. Thousands of civilians are likely to flee the deteriorating security and humanitarian conditions inside Afghanistan over the coming weeks.  Some 3.7 million Afghan refugees who have fled the conflict in Afghanistan over the past two decades are currently living in neighboring countries - 1.5 million of them in Iran, and more than 2 million in Pakistan. Frustrated by the large scale and protracted nature of the refugee crisis and the lack of international attention to their plight, both Iran and Pakistan have officially closed their borders to refugees for the past year. An estimated 10,000 Afghan refugees, including thousands of women and children, have been camped on several islands in the Pyanj River at the Tajikistan border, since the Tajik government closed its borders a year ago and stationed 10,000 Russian troops at the border to prevent refugees from entering.  The right of refugees not to be returned to a country where their lives or freedom are threatened is a fundamental principle of international customary law and is enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention, to which Iran, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and China are all parties.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Afghanistan, China and Tibet, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran","Women's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

President Isaias Afewerki’s government should immediately free recently detained political dissidents, allow the return of university students to their classes, and lift the ban it decreed as of Wednesday on privately owned newspapers, Human Rights Watch said.  """"The government is trying to stamp out all criticism of its disastrous war policies,"""" said Suliman Baldo, senior researcher in the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The situation is growing sharply worse.""""  At the root of the unrest is the government’s prosecution of the country’s disastrous two-year border war with Ethiopia that caused tremendous suffering for the population, and seriously undermined the country’s developmental achievements.  """"President Afewerki’s government is apparently trying to use the world’s current preoccupation with other events to escalate its repressive campaign against dissidents,"""" Baldo said.  The Eritrean government on Wednesday arrested five political reformists, following the arrest on Tuesday of six others. The eleven detainees are members of the so-called “G-15,” a reference to a group of fifteen founding members of the liberation front that has led the country to its independence from Ethiopia in 1991 after thirty years of a devastating civil war, and ruled over it ever since. The G-15 last May signed a public letter criticizing President Afewerki for ruling in an “illegal and unconstitutional” manner, and calling on him to institute democratic reforms. Those arrested on Tuesday and Wednesday include Beraki Gebreselassie, Petros Solomon, Mohamed Sherifo, Ocbe Abraha, and Haile Woldensae, all of whom had, until recently, held high-ranking political and military positions.  There are genuine concerns about the whereabouts and detention conditions of the reformists. Heightening these concerns was a statement published in Hadas Eritrea, a government newspaper and the only one currently allowed to publish, claiming that the government has only moved against “those who had committed crimes against the sovereignty, security and peace of the nation.” The reformists might thus be accused of “treason,” a crime punishable by death under Eritrean law, and most likely brought before a closed government “special court.""""  Authorities also announced the closure of all the independent press in the country as of Wednesday. The privately owned press provided a forum for the widening debate on needed reforms in Eritrea. A government radio broadcast said that the country’s eight private newspapers had ignored repeated warnings to correct unspecified mistakes.  The recent clampdown on civil society and critical political voices was reportedly triggered by an increasingly tense standoff between the government and university students demanding greater academic freedom and social liberties, particularly the publication last week in a private newspaper of a long diary of a student on a forced summer work program.  Students at the University of Asmara, the only one in the country, had joined in criticizing the government by demanding better treatment from the government and consultation on matters that concern them. The summer work program is mandatory for University of Asmara students, who are allowed to defer their national military service until after graduation. This year, the students protested the appalling conditions of previous camps. On July 31, the police arrested the president of the Asmara University student council, Semere Kesete, a day after he publicly announced that students would not enroll in the summer program unless certain reforms were carried out. He remains in jail without charge.  When students tried to protest his arrest at his court appearance on August 10, four hundred of them were rounded up and sent to the work program in Wia, a desert camp near the Red Sea port of Massawa, in a region where daytime temperatures hover about 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius). The government accused the students, who were not charged, of “unruly behavior” and “unlawful acts.” Following the forcible transfer of the arrested students to Wia, 1700 others """"voluntarily” joined them there, according to the government. The government acknowledged that two students died of heatstroke during the past month, but attributed the loss to “lack of adequate logistical support” at the camp. There were reports that a number of other students were taken for treatment from heat exhaustion in closed military hospitals, and some may have died.  Officials recently told students that they could return to Asmara to register for the new academic year at the end of August, but postponed the date when the students refused to be addressed by the visiting president of the University of Asmara. Police also used batons to disperse regular gatherings of parents demanding the return of their children from the contested work program, and reportedly arrested some of the protesters.  The newspaper article that seemingly precipitated the government's heavy-handed reaction described the ordeal of the students held at Wia camp in detail. Prior to the closure of the independent press, a number of journalists were sent to the mandatory national service in what appeared to be an attempt to silence them. The editor and a reporter for one newspaper, Keste Debena, have been forced to flee to Sudan. Both had previously been arrested several times for their reporting. They are among an increasing number of Eritreans who have fled the country in the last three months. In early August, the chief justice was deposed, about two weeks after he publicly complained about executive interference with the judiciary.","Africa, Eritrea",""

If the United States were to be engaged in an armed conflict in Afghanistan or elsewhere, international humanitarian law does not prevent military forces from targeting opposing troops, including their commanders, Human Rights Watch said.  However, Human Rights Watch said that in countries where law enforcement cooperation is possible, the United States should remain committed to a criminal justice approach --investigation, arrest, trial and punishment, with all the guarantees of a fair trial that are central to any system of respect for human rights -- rather than executions or targeting noncombatants. Just as the """"war"""" on drugs or the mafia does not obviate basic criminal justice guarantees, so the war on the organization responsible for the September 11 attacks should not bypass the human-rights protection against assassination.  Human Rights Watch urged that the CIA should continue to discourage relationships with abusive informants whenever it is possible that the informant will understand the relationship to suggest tacit approval of abusive conduct -- an issue of particular concern if abusive governments are enlisted in efforts to curb terrorism. The CIA guidelines clearly had nothing to do with the intelligence failure before the September 11 attacks, the letter added.

The export of anti-personnel landmines has virtually ceased and the number of countries producing the weapon has decreased from 55 to 14, the new report said. """"The antipersonnel mine is fast becoming a relic of the past century,"""" said Stephen Goose of Human Rights Watch, a founding member of the ICBL. """"This weapon remains in the ground of some 90 countries and claims new victims every day. But its utility as a weapon has been rejected by nearly three-quarters of the countries in the world.""""  A total of 141 countries have now joined the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, which outlaws any use, production, transfer or stockpiling of antipersonnel mines. The United States is not among them.  The ICBL's 1,175-page Landmine Monitor Report 2001: Toward a Mine-Free World was edited and produced by Human Rights Watch, a founding member of the ICBL, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. The report provides new details on mine use, production, trade, stockpiling, demining and mine victim assistance in every country of the world in the period from May 2000 to mid-2001.  """"We are pleased to be able to report progress that has been made over the past year to implement the mine ban, but we're also deeply disturbed that antipersonnel mines continue to be used by a number of governments and rebel groups,"""" said Goose. """"We condemn any use of this inherently indiscriminate weapon by any actor as a flagrant violation of international humanitarian law.""""  According to the report, since May 2000 it appears likely that antipersonnel mines were used in 23 conflicts by as many as 15 governments and at least 30 rebel groups or non- state actors. This mainly reflects continued use in ongoing conflicts, but new instances of reported use included the laying of mines on borders by the governments of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and, notably, Russia inside Tajikistan, which is a party to the treaty, as well as new use by rebels in Macedonia. According to the report, the most regular mine use is likely occurring in Russia (Chechnya), Sri Lanka, and Burma, by both government and rebel forces.  Landmine Monitor Report 2001 also documents a strong possibility of use of antipersonnel mines by Uganda, which is a party to the treaty, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in June 2000. Uganda has denied this use. One treaty signatory, Angola, acknowledges continued use of antipersonnel mines and Landmine Monitor believes that it is likely that two other signatories, Ethiopia and Sudan, used antipersonnel mines in the reporting period. There are serious, but unconfirmed, allegations about use by Rwanda in the DRC in June 2000 when it was a treaty signatory (it has now ratified the treaty) and Burundi, another treaty signatory. All four of these governments deny use.  On Tuesday, September 18, the ICBL will present Landmine Monitor Report 2001 to diplomats attending the Third Meeting of States Parties to the Mine Ban Treaty in Managua, Nicaragua, the most mine-affected country of Central America.

The conference concluded Saturday in Durban, South Africa. """"The Indian government tried for a year and a half to deny that caste discrimination is a form of racial discrimination,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"But as a result of this conference, even the Secretary-General of the United Nations has acknowledged the gravity of work and descent-based discrimination, and India will have a hard time from now on avoiding international scrutiny.""""  Although India ultimately succeeded in getting references to caste discrimination removed from the final document, the conference was a watershed nonetheless for the Dalit movement. The Dalit contingent of more than 160 activists was one of the largest and best organized nongovernmental delegations present, and drew strong international support from governments, U.N. officials, and India's own National Human Rights Commission.  """"This conference served as a milestone in the grassroots Dalit movement against the crime of untouchability and other forms of caste discrimination worldwide,"""" Narula said. She noted that such discrimination is practiced not only in India and other parts of South Asia but also in Japan, Nigeria, Senegal, and elsewhere.  Human Rights Watch criticized the government of Nepal for bowing to Indian pressure on the caste issue, despite its August 2001 proclamation to abolish the untouchability that affects 4.5 million Nepalese Dalits.  The declaration produced by a parallel NGO conference affirmed the conclusions of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights that untouchability, bonded labor, manual scavenging and other caste-based abuses are repugnant and insidious forms of racial discrimination.

The WCAR often seemed dominated by acrimonious disputes over the Middle East, including a walk-out by the United States and Israel. But Human Rights Watch said that on many other issues, including the protection of migrants and refugees, repairing the legacy of slavery and equal nationality rights for women, critical progress was made. The United Nations will appoint a panel of five experts to review how countries carry out their commitments.  """"If governments would really put in practice what they agreed to here, we could make real headway in combating racism,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"We're pleased that the conference gave the United Nations a strong role in making sure that the promises made in Durban don't die here.""""  The summit called for far-reaching programs to address intolerance and discrimination against the 150 million migrants in the world, including education campaigns and prevention of workplace bias. It asked countries to combat intolerance against refugees and to protect the more than 30 million people displaced in their own countries. It asked countries to monitor and ensure accountability for police misconduct and to eliminate """"racial profiling."""" The conference called on countries to fund anti-racism efforts and public awareness campaigns in schools and the media. It urged governments to collect data disaggregated by race, which Human Rights Watch said was a first means of identifying and then addressing discrimination in health and the provision of government services.  The conference acknowledged that slavery and the slave trade """"are a crime against humanity and should always have been so,"""" and said that states had a """"moral obligation"""" to """"take appropriate and effective measures to halt and reverse the lasting consequences of those practices."""" """"This is an historic recognition of the criminality of slavery and the moral obligation to repair its lasting damage,"""" said Brody.  In a significant step, the conference asked countries to allow women the right, on an equal basis with men, to transmit their nationality to their children and spouses, a right denied in many countries, especially in the Middle East and North Africa. Moreover, the conference program of action acknowledges the multiple and unique ways in which racism and sexism interact to deny women their human rights, Human Rights Watch said.  Human Rights Watch noted that the summit, and the five regional meetings which preceded it, had galvanized tens of thousands of victims to voice their demands.  """"A great achievement of this process has been the unprecedented mobilization of victims of racism from communities around the world, such as the so-called untouchables of South Asia, the Roma of Europe, and blacks in Latin America who have put their plights squarely on the international agenda,"""" said Brody.  Furious lobbying by the Indian government led to a last-minute removal of references in the conference documents to discrimination based on """"work and descent,"""" a reference to the plight of the Dalits, the so-called untouchables.

This past week, some fifteen dissidents, many of them former members of the Vietnamese Communist Party and military veterans, have been detained and interrogated. Human Rights Watch urged the government to cease the harassment and release any detainees still in custody, and called on Vietnam's donors to raise the issue directly with government authorities.  On September 5, police in Hanoi detained and interrogated former military historian Pham Que Duong, writer Hoang Tien, former high-ranking Party cadre Hoang Minh Chinh, journalist Nguyen Vu Binh, and film producer Duong Hung. Sources in Vietnam have reported that another ten activists, including scholar Tran Van Khue in Ho Chi Minh City and geologist and political essayist Nguyen Thanh Giang, have also been detained, at least temporarily, since September 6.  """"This appears to be the largest and most systematic effort to intimidate Vietnamese dissidents in a long time,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"Despite all the speculation after the Communist Party Congress earlier this year that a more reform-minded group was now in power, this is evidence that the new regime may be no more tolerant of dissent than the previous one.""""  On Wednesday, September 5, Pham Que Duong, 70, was arrested at his Hanoi home at 7 a.m. by a dozen policemen, who delivered a written summons ordering him to go to police headquarters. He was interrogated by the police until 8 p.m. that night, when he was allowed to return home. His house was searched while he was in custody. On September 6 he was ordered to return to police headquarters for further interrogation on a daily basis until further notice. Two other dissidents, writer Hoang Tien and film producer Duong Hung, who stopped by Pham Que Duong's home on September 5 to inquire about his well-being, were subsequently taken into custody and escorted to police headquarters for questioning.  That same morning political critics Hoang Minh Chinh and Nguyen Vu Binh were arrested at Hoang Minh Chinh's home and taken to police headquarters. The dissidents remain in detention during the day but are allowed to return home late in the evening on condition that they report to police headquarters every morning. Police reportedly have been stationed outside of several dissidents' homes and have taken visitors to police stations for questioning. Mobile telephones of most of Vietnam's leading dissidents have been disconnected since September 5, making confirmation of their whereabouts difficult. On September 2, just days before the interrogations, Pham Que Duong and Tran Van Khue submitted a request to the government to form an independent anti-corruption organization. The request listed Pham as the Hanoi spokesman of the """"National Association to Fight Corruption,"""" and Tran Van Khue as the Ho Chi Minh City spokesman. In February and again in June 2001, Pham Que Duong, Hoang Minh Chinh, and Hoang Tien joined more than a dozen other dissidents in signing joint appeals to Party officials calling for the repeal of Administrative Detention Decree 51/CP, which allows detention of dissidents for up to two years without trial.  Human Rights Watch called on Vietnam's donors to protest the detentions when they meet in Tokyo on November 15-16 for an annual conference under the auspices of the World Bank.  """"Vietnam's donors should strongly condemn this crackdown on the open debate of democratic reforms and corruption,"""" said Jones. """"A strategy for economic development must include concrete steps to ensure respect for basic rights and freedoms."""" Background Dissidents who have been arrested or ordered to police headquarters for questioning this week include the following:  · Pham Que Duong, 70, is a former colonel in the People's Liberation Army. He joined the VCP in 1948, and in 1982 became editor in chief of Tap Chi Lich Su Quan Su (Military History Review).

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/09/07/indonesia-megawati-should-investigate-aceh-killing","Indonesia- Megawati Should Investigate Aceh Killing","Indonesia: Megawati Should Investigate Aceh Killing","","09/07/2001","(New York) -- Human Rights Watch today called on the Indonesian government to launch a thorough and impartial investigation into the killing of Dayan Dawood, the rector of Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh. The American-trained Prof. Dawood, fifty-five, was shot by unidentified gunmen on a motorcycle in broad daylight on Thursday in the center of town as he was heading back from the campus in his official car. """"We condemn this senseless murder, and call on President Megawati to do everything in her power to ensure the perpetrators are found and brought to justice,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Unfortunately, justice in Aceh is an exceedingly rare commodity.""""  The murder took place two days before Megawati Sukarnoputri, Indonesia's new president, is scheduled to visit the violence-wracked province.  The killing came just after Prof. Dawood had offered to have the university play a more prominent role in seeking a solution to the armed conflict in Aceh between Indonesian forces and pro-independence guerrillas of the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM). Days before the killing, on Monday, September 4, 2001, on the occasion of Syiah Kuala University's fortieth anniversary, Prof. Dawood praised existing dialogue efforts but said it might be time to turn to the university campus to come up with a new concept for peace.  Both the military and GAM forces have been responsible for political assassinations in Aceh, and both sides have accused each other in Prof. Dawood's murder.  """"The killing represents not only the loss of a respected intellectual leader -- it means another major blow to civil society and fundamental freedoms in Aceh,"""" said Jones. """"People were already fearful of speaking out on any subject that could be misconstrued by either side; this murder is going to make them terrified.""""  Jones called on the government to immediately appoint a neutral commission of inquiry to look into the killing whose impartiality and competence would not be open to question. She also urged heads of state and other international officials who meet with President Megawati to raise the case directly with her.  On September 17, Megawati leaves Indonesia for visits to Bosnia, the United States, and Japan.  There are conflicting accounts of possible motives for the killing. GAM has denied responsibility, saying that GAM only targets Indonesian security forces. GAM, however, is also known to have targeted other individuals it believes to be linked to the government. On the other hand, many in Banda Aceh have raised questions about how the killing of such a prominent figure as Prof. Dawood could take place on the streets of the provincial capital, less than half a kilometer from the governor's office, without the complicity of military elements. Banda Aceh currently is swarming with troops as security forces prepare for the presidential visit.  Human Rights Watch last met with Prof. Dawood in December 2000. At the time, he had been frank about the risk to his own life. He noted how GAM was demanding money and borrowing vehicles belonging to his staff and making threats if they did not get what they wanted. The demands for payment had been going on since mid-2000. He said he had been asked for Rp.200 million (then about US $20,000), and other senior staff for Rp.20 million (US $2,000). The demands came in the form of a letter signed by the district commander for GAM. He did not say whether he had paid, but he did say that if he did not, he would be a target of GAM, and if he did, he would be considered pro-GAM by the army. He was clearly afraid of both sides. This is not the first assassination of a major academic leader in Aceh. On September 16, 2000, Prof. Safwan Idris, the rector of the ar-Raniry State Islamic Institute (IAIN) in Banda Aceh and a close friend of Prof. Dawood, was murdered at his home, also by men on a motorcycle. The murder remains unsolved to this day, and each side has accused the other of responsibility.  Prof. Dawood's killing is the second high-profile political murder in Aceh in less than a week. On Saturday, Zaini Sulaiman, a member of the Aceh provincial parliament representing the United Development Party (PPP), was killed at his home following evening prayers by men who had come to his front door. Both sides have denied any role in that murder as well.  Prof. Dawood's murder also comes at a time when teachers and schools are under particular attack. On Monday, the head of the Indonesian Teachers' Association in Aceh announced that 135 elementary, junior high, and high school teachers had been victims of violence over the last two years. In August 2001, as Indonesia's national day approached, more than fifty elementary schools were burned to the ground in North Aceh and Aceh Besar districts.  Prof. Dawood leaves a wife and three children. He received his M.A. from the University of Hawaii.","Asia, Indonesia","Children's Rights, Attacks on Education"

The organization condemned the arrest earlier this week of Riad al-Turk, 71 years old, who is Syria's best-known former political prisoner. He was detained in 1980, and was held without charge or trial until his release in May 1998. It is not known where al-Turk is being held or what charges, if any, have been lodged against him.  Since his release, al-Turk has publicly championed reform and democracy. Following his arrest, the government-controlled daily newspaper al-Thawra castigated him for slandering the authorities and spreading misinformation.  """"Freedom of expression is an indispensable benchmark of the transition to a free society,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Syrian government is now blatantly trampling that right.""""  Human Rights Watch also cited and condemned the continuing detention of independent member of parliament Mamoun al-Homsi, who was arrested on August 9, and the recent lawsuit filed against Nizar Nayouf, the journalist and human rights defender who was released in May after serving nine years of a ten-year prison term.  """"If this dangerous pattern continues, it threatens to snuff out the voices of citizens who have been openly and peacefully calling for political reform since Bashar al-Asad succeeded his father as president last year,"""" Megally said.  Al-Homsi began a hunger strike on August 7 to highlight political demands that included the lifting of emergency law, in force in Syria uninterruptedly since 1963. The independent legislator was reportedly charged with """"insulting the constitution, opposing the government and engagement in intelligence with foreign quarters,"""" which could result in a maximum prison terms of fifteen years.  On September 3, Nizar Nayouf's lawyer, Anwar al-Bunni, reported that his client was summoned to appear before an investigating judge to respond to charges of attempting to change the Syrian constitution by illegal means, creating sectarian strife, and disseminating information abroad harmful to the state. Lawyers from the Ba'th party initiated the complaint, al-Bunni said. Nayouf, who is in France for medical treatment, has been outspoken in calling for accountability for past human rights abuses, including the massacre of up to 1,100 unarmed inmates at Tadmor military prison in June 1980 by commando forces under the command of Rifat al-Asad, the former president's brother who now lives in exile in Europe.  Emerging independent human rights and other citizens’ groups in Syria, such as the popular civic forums held in private homes, have no legal status and remain vulnerable to harassment or closure at the whim of authorities. One of the forums, hosted by outspoken member of parliament Riad Seif, met on September 5 with some 400 people reportedly in attendance. Seif said that he planned to hold meetings twice a month despite the fact that authorities twice refused to grant the group legal authorization.  In addition, Syria has no law that permits the organizing of opposition political parties. Former political prisoners who have been meeting and speaking freely have reported to Human Rights Watch that they are under surveillance by security forces and that family members have been questioned about their political activities.  """"Now is the time for democratic countries with close bilateral relations with Syria, such as France, to convince the government to reverse this alarming trend,"""" Megally said. The European Union, with which Syria has been negotiating a free-trade Association Agreement, should also weigh in as forcefully as possible, he added. The agreement includes language that the pact is premised on respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.  Syria is a signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees freedom of expression and association. The United Nations Human Rights Committee examined Syria's compliance with the treaty earlier this year and in March recommended that Syria lift the state of emergency """"as soon as possible."""" It criticized the practice of incommunicado pre-trial detention, and called on Syria to ensure that anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge be brought promptly before a judge and provided access to lawyers and contact with family members. It also expressed concern """"at the restrictions that can be placed on the establishment of private association and institutions, including independent non-governmental organizations and human rights organizations"""" and """"restrictions on the holding of public meetings and demonstrations.","Middle East/North Africa, Syria",""

The report, titled Crimes Against Civilians: Abuses by Macedonian Forces in Ljuboten, August 10-12, 2001, charges that Macedonian police troops shot dead six civilians and burned at least twenty-two homes, sheds, and stores in the course of their August 12 house-to-house attack on the village.  The rights group pressed for an immediate investigation, including an inquiry into the role of Macedonian Minister of Interior Ljube Boskovski, who was present in the village on August 12, the day the worst violations occurred.  """"The Macedonian government must answer to the people of Ljuboten,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"It is deeply disturbing that the Minister of Interior appears to have been so intimately involved in one of the worst abuses of the war. We demand an immediate and impartial investigation.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to make public the results of its investigation into the events in Ljuboten. Human Rights Watch pressed for a separate investigation by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which has jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Macedonia conflict.  Based on a two-week in-depth investigation, including a visit to Ljuboten, interviews with victims and witnesses, and examination of photographic evidence, the report also documented indiscriminate shelling that claimed another three lives in Ljuboten. Contrary to the government's account of the offensive, researchers found no evidence that the ethnic Albanian rebel National Liberation Army was present in the village.  Hundreds of ethnic Albanian civilians who tried to flee Ljuboten faced further abuse. Ethnic Macedonian vigilantes beat three men unconscious in full view of the Macedonian police on August 12. One of the men was shot in the head by the Macedonian police as he attempted to flee the beating. Police separated over one hundred men and boys from their wives and children and took them to police stations in Skopje, where they were subjected to severe beatings. Atulah Qaini, aged thirty-five, was taken away alive from the village by police officers, and his badly beaten and mutilated corpse was later recovered by family members from the city morgue. According to their relatives, at least twenty-four men from Ljuboten, including a thirteen-year-old boy, remain in police custody after suffering serious beatings from the police.  The police abuse suffered by ethnic Albanians fleeing Ljuboten is consistent with patterns of systematic abuse Human Rights Watch has documented in Macedonia over the past six months. Human Rights Watch urged international monitors to make a priority of monitoring and reporting on the conduct of Macedonian police.  """"Endemic police abuse is a potential spark that could re-ignite the conflict in Macedonia,"""" Andersen said. """"We can't wait for a gradual restructuring of the police over the next three years. Immediate steps-including monitoring and accountability-are needed to curb abuse.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

Human Rights Watch supports the draft outcome document's focus on the rights of children and the fundamental importance of the Convention on the Rights of the Child as a basis for ensuring the survival, protection, development and participation of children. We particularly welcome Section II., """"Our Challenge,"""" and Section V.2, """"Protecting against Abuse and Exploitation,"""" which acknowledge the broad range of hazards and abuses faced by children, and recognize the particular vulnerability of children affected by armed conflict, children with disabilities, street children, children engaged in abusive labor, and those subject to violence and other forms of exploitation.    While we welcome the document as a useful basis for discussion, we believe certain elements can be strengthened and improved.    Reinforcing the CRC: When the 1990 World Summit for Children took place, the Convention on the Rights of the Child had just been adopted, and the process of its signature and ratification was still in its earliest stages. The Declaration adopted at the Summit identified the Convention as """"a new opportunity to make respect for children's rights and welfare truly universal."""" Ten years later, the Convention has been ratified by 191 nations, signifying nearly universal recognition and acceptance of a comprehensive child rights agenda. However, failure to fully implement the Convention stands today as the single largest impediment to the global realization of children's rights. To improve the lives of children, hastening the full implementation of the Convention must be at the heart of commitments made at the Special Session.    Support for New Standards: New instruments have been created and adopted in the last decade that strengthen the protections guaranteed by the Convention in significant ways. These particularly relate to the situation of children in armed conflict and those involved in abusive child labor. Taken together with the Convention, these instruments create a powerful legal framework on behalf of children.    We recommend:    ·  The Special Session should recognize the importance of new treaties adopted in the last decade and commit to ratification of the following instruments by 150 states by 2005, and work towards universal ratification by 2010: Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict, the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court, the Mine Ban Treaty, and ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labor.    Reflecting the Full Range of Children's Rights: The World Summit on Children adopted laudable goals to improve the health and welfare of children. However, the major goals identified in the Plan of Action adopted at the Summit dealt almost exclusively with health, nutrition and education. As the full range of children's rights - including civil rights and freedoms, and the right to protection from abuse, economic and sexual exploitation, torture and other forms of violence, etc., have become broadly recognized, it is incumbent upon governments to adopt appropriate goals encompassing the survival, protection, development and participation of children. The """"key objectives"""" identified in Section IV of the draft outcome document do not reflect such a comprehensive approach. Of the twenty-one goals identified, nine relate to health and four relate to education. While the eight remaining goals encompass a range of issues, many are very general, and important elements are not adequately addressed. In particular, Human Rights Watch recommends the inclusion of the following goals:   ·  Violence: By 2005, a comprehensive international study on violence against children should be completed by the Secretary General. As recommended by the Committee on the Rights of the Child, such a study should explore the different types of violent treatment of which children are victims, the extent of such violence and its impact on children, and put forward recommendations for action, including effective remedies and preventative and rehabilitative measures.       ·  By 2010, the recommendations of the study should be implemented with a view towards eliminating violence against children. All states should include in their states parties reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child information on all alleged cases of abuse or death of children in state custody, including steps taken to investigate such cases and prosecute the perpetrators.       Juvenile Justice: By 2005, all states should significantly reduce the number of children in detention, eliminate any application of the death penalty for offenses committed before the age of eighteen, and ensure that national juvenile justice mechanisms are in accordance with the Convention on the Rights of the Child and other relevant international standards, including the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Administration of Juvenile Justice, the UN Rules for the Protection of Juveniles Deprived of their Liberty, and the UN Guidelines for the Prevention of Juvenile Delinquency. Independent monitoring mechanisms should be established in each state to investigate conditions of detention and ensure that the rights of children are respected.       ·  Children and Armed Conflict: Eliminate the use of children as soldiers by 2010 and fully implement programs and policies to effectively protect the rights of refugee and internally displaced children, including their rights to education, health and safety.    Monitoring Mechanisms: The successful implementation of goals established at the upcoming Special Session on Children will depend on a vibrant and meaningful monitoring system. Unfortunately, the monitoring section of the document is weak and vague, and does not specify mechanisms that will ensure implementation of the outcome document's goals. We recommend:   ·  Each national government should establish or designate an independent body to monitor the progress made in implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the goals of the outcome document of the Special Session, and to ensure that each country adopt a comprehensive national plan of action, with specific, time-bound and measurable objectives. Such a body must include active participation by non-governmental organizations.       ·  Governments should include systematic information on their progress in implementing the goals of the outcome document and their national plans in their regular reports to the Committee on the Rights of the Child.    ·  Governments should commit additional resources, in particular for staff support, to the Committee on the Rights of the Child to ensure its effective functioning.","Global","Children's Rights"

Special Session on Children, the United States and the Rights of Children","","09/01/2001","Human Rights Watch Comments on the UN Special Session on Children Draft Provisional Outcome Document """"A World Fit for Children""""   Three preparatory committee meetings have been held over the last year to debate the Declaration and Plan of Action to be adopted next month. Informal consultations have taken place this week to try to finalize this document.   Q: What does Human Rights Watch hope the session will accomplish?   A: Human Rights Watch's position has been that the Special Session's plan of action should meet four basic criteria:  1) It should reinforce the Convention on the Rights of the Child and hasten its full implementation;  2) It should support universal ratification and implementation of key new treaties developed over the last decade that strengthen the protection of children.  3) Its goals should reflect the full range of children's rights, including protection from violence, exploitation and abuse, as well as those in the social sector areas (e.g. health and education) that have traditionally received greater attention. 4) It should ensure strong mechanisms to monitor government obligations and commitments that include meaningful participation from non-governmental organizations and civil society.  Q: What role has the United States taken during these negotiations?  A: Although U.S. opposition to abortion has received the most publicity, the stance of the United States towards the central issue of the rights of children is of grave concern. During these negotiations, the United States has consistently sought to eliminate or minimize references to the Convention on the Rights of the Child in the Declaration and Plan of Action, and has refused to accept language that refers to the Convention as the primary international standard for the promotion and protection of children's rights. The U.S. has also sought to remove references to the """"rights"""" of children, in favor of language supporting the """"well-being"""" of children.   Q: Why is the Convention on the Rights of the Child important to the Special Session?   A: The Convention reflects the full range of children's rights and should be the starting point for stronger efforts to improve the lives of children. Among its provisions, it requires governments to consider the best interests of the child, to provide children with education and health care, and to protect children from discrimination, sexual and economic exploitation and other abuse.  Adopted by the United Nations on November 20, 1989, itt is now the most universally-ratified treaty in history, with 191 states parties.   Q: What is the US position towards the convention?  A: The United States and Somalia are the only countries in the world that have failed to ratify the Convention. Although the United States signed the Convention on February 16, 1995, the treaty has never been submitted to the U.S. Senate and the United States has stated that it has no plans to ratify the convention.   During negotiations for the Special Session in February, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael Southwick stated that """"it is misleading and inappropriate to use the Convention as a litmus test to measure a nation's commitment to children. As a non-party to the Convention, the United States does not accept obligations based on it, nor do we accept that it is the best or only framework for developing programs and policies to benefit children.""""  Q: Why hasn't the United States ratified the Convention?   A: Some critics in the United States have lobbied heavily against ratification of the convention, claiming that the convention will undermine parental authority, interfere with parents' ability to raise and discipline their children, and will elevate the rights of children above the rights of parents. In reality, the convention repeatedly refers to the importance of the parent-child relationship, and requires governments to respect the rights and duties of parents.  The most significant contradiction between the convention and U.S. law and practice is in relation to the death penalty. The Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the use of the death penalty for offenses committed before the age of eighteen. However, twenty-five U.S. states allow executions of juvenile offenders, and as of July 1, 2001, there were eighty-five juvenile offenders on death row in the United States. In the last five years, eight executions of juvenile offenders were carried out in the United States. During the same period, Iran, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria each carried out one such execution, but each has now expressly renounced the practice.   During the negotiations for the Special Session, the European Union, supported by numerous other governments, sought the inclusion of language prohibiting the use of the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole for crimes committed by children. The United States, joined only by Iran, rejected the proposal. Q: Does the US have any other problems with the Convention?   A: Traditionally, the United States has recognized civil and political rights (such as the rights to expression, assembly and due process), but not economic, social and cultural rights (such as the right to education, health care and an adequate standard of living). The convention includes both. Also, the United States also argues that many of the issues addressed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child lie primarily within the jurisdiction of the states, rather than the federal government. For example, in the United States, individual states are responsible for education, and for setting laws related to the administration of juvenile justice.   Federalism in the U.S. should not be a bar to ratifying the convention.  Other countries with federal systems have ratified the Convention, including Brazil, Germany and Mexico. The U.S. may also adopt a reservation or understanding to address this issue, and in fact, has done so in the past in relation to other international treaties.","United States","Children's Rights, United Nations"

The war in Aceh and an outbreak of communal violence in West Kalimantan produced the most civilian casualties, but conflicts in Maluku (the Moluccas), Central Sulawesi, and Papua (Irian Jaya) continued to simmer. By September, the number of displaced persons remained well over one million, half of them from Maluku. The government made no serious efforts to address past or current abuses, new human rights legislation notwithstanding. The number of political prisoners rose steadily during the year, with many peaceful political activists charged with """"spreading hatred toward the government,"""" an offense associated with the government of former president Soeharto. The justice system remained a shambles. Defending human rights became a dangerous occupation, particularly in Aceh, where at least six rights workers were killed. Indonesia's bilateral donors showed concern over the regional conflicts, but they were riveted by the long drawn-out struggle in Jakarta between the parliament and President Abdurrahman Wahid. That conflict ended peacefully in late July with Wahid's impeachment and the accession to the presidency of Megawati Sukarnoputri, but the power struggle consumed so much energy of the political elite that all of the country's major problems, including rebellion, displacement, and disruptions from a poorly thought-through decentralization program, were left to fester. A combination of relief over the transition, delight over key cabinet appointees, and strategic and economic interests led many donors to rush to support the new administration, including through military assistance. Megawati's first cabinet is strong in the economics and foreign affairs posts, but her choice of Attorney-General is disastrous. The new minister, M.A. Rahman is a career prosecutor known for obstructing human rights cases, particularly with regard to East Timor. The appointment continued a pattern of one step forward, two steps back that marked Indonesia's approach to accountability during the year. In November 2000, the parliament passed Law No.26 setting up new courts to try cases of serious human rights violations. For the first time, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other crimes of a """"widespread or systematic"""" nature as defined in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court were incorporated into Indonesian law. The law established new courts to try such cases and provided for the establishment of """"ad hoc"""" courts to try cases of serious human rights abuses that had occurred before the law took effect, including the 1999 East Timor cases. But President Wahid's Attorney-General, Marzuki Darusman, dithered and by the time the Wahid government fell, had failed to set up the courts or proceed with a single prosecution. His accomplice in procrastination was his deputy, M.A. Rahman. As of September 2001, prosecutors for the new courts had been named, as had some but not all of the judges. No trials were in sight. Other problems with accountability surfaced. The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission, known as Komnas-HAM, had been one of the most courageous defenders of human rights during the late Soeharto years. Ironically, it began to lose its critical edge under the democratically-elected Abdurrahman Wahid. Law No.26 gave Komnas-HAM, rather than the police, responsibility for initial investigations into cases of serious human rights violations, but leading obstructionists within Komnas-HAM itself increasingly blocked action on key cases. A bill in the parliament to set up a national truth and reconciliation commission along the lines of the South African model remained undiscussed as of late 2001. With no interest in prosecutions on the part of the president, the attorney-general, or the minister of justice, let alone the military, prospects for accountability looked bleaker than ever. Aceh The situation in Aceh deteriorated sharply during the year, and a six-hour visit in September by Megawati to the area showed no signs of improving matters. The death toll since January 2001 had topped 1,000 by September, and while most of the deaths were civilians killed in the course of military operations, the rebel Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM) was also responsible for abuses. Key incidents involving civilians include the arrest on November 20, 2000 of Muhammad Nazar, civilian head of the Information Center for a Referendum on Aceh (Sentral Informasi Referendum Aceh or SIRA); the execution by armed soldiers and civilians on December 6, 2000 of three humanitarian aid workers; the subsequent escape (almost certainly with official connivance) of several of the suspected perpetrators in the aid workers case; the murder on March 29 of human rights lawyer, Suprin Sulaiman, together with his client, Teungku Kamal, and a driver, Amiruddin, shortly after Kamal had been summoned as a suspect in criminal defamation of the police; an eruption of violence in June in Central Aceh by both GAM and military forces in which at least 150 civilians, and probably many more, died; the massacre on August 9 of thirty-one Acehnese workers at the Bumi Flora palm oil plantation in Julok, East Aceh; and a number of assassination of civilian leaders, including local political leaders and the rector of the leading university in Aceh. On April 11, President Wahid issued President Instruction (Inpres) No.4, which effectively authorized increased police-military operations in Aceh. The instruction was issued following the closure of Exxon-Mobil gasfields in North Aceh because of security threats. The decree was roundly denounced in Aceh and the call for its revocation became a rallying cry for political activists province-wide. Military operations were characterized, among other things, by collective punishment of villages thought to be harboring GAM members. Even before Inpres No.4 was issued, the security forces made a practice of retaliatory burnings of houses and shops to punish GAM attacks. Efforts at dialogue proved fruitless. Negotiations between the Indonesian government and GAM, facilitated by the Geneva-based Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, foundered on mutual lack of trust and effectively broke down in early July when. Indonesia unilaterally withdrew from a security monitoring team. Later that month, police in Banda Aceh arrested six GAM negotiators despite government guarantees of their security. Five of the negotiators were released on August 29; one continued to be held into September on the grounds that he held a false passport. Banda Aceh's main newspaper, Serambi Indonesia, was forced to close twice during the year because of GAM threats, once in June and once in August. President Megawati signed a law giving autonomy to Aceh on August 11 and made that implementation of that law the centerpiece of her Aceh policy. But the law, changing the name of the province to Nanggroe Aceh Daroessalam (NAD), did not appear to have widespread support, especially there was little consultation in Aceh before it was passed. Irian Jaya (Papua) Conditions in Papua also continued to worsen. From 1998 through the first half of 2000, Papua had witnessed the emergence of a popular pro-independence movement which culminated with an all-Papua congress in June 2000. Although the Indonesian government made important political overtures to Papuan leaders in response, including the promise of legislation guaranteeing substantial autonomy for the province (not yet delivered at this writing), it also returned to a hardline approach. In late 2000 and throughout 2001, military and police have intimidated and at times attacked civilians in areas where rebels were believed to be active; moved aggressively against independence demonstrators, in a number of cases killing or seriously injuring them; increased surveillance and harassment of prominent civil society leaders, including human rights activists; and banned even peaceful expression of support for Papuan independence, putting civilian independence leaders on trial in Wamena and Jayapura and trying and convicting Papuan student demonstrators in Jakarta, many of them under the same Soeharto-era """"spreading hatred"""" laws mentioned above. Central Kalimantan An eruption of violence in Central Kalimantan in February 2001 around the logging port of Sampit, Kotawaringin Timur district, led to indigenous Dayaks killing some 500 immigrants from the island of Madura, off the coast of East Java, and displacing more than 150,000. Many of the killings involved decapitation, and little distinction was made between men, women, and children. The outbreak had complex roots but appeared to be linked to longstanding economic and social grievances of the Dayaks, competition over local resources, and new opportunities for political mobilization along ethnic lines. Muhamad Usop, a Dayak leader who sought the Central Kalimantan governorship, was arrested on May 4 and held briefly on incitement charges. As elsewhere in Indonesia, police proved incapable of halting the violence, and the army was sent in, further poisoning relations between the two institutions. Maluku Christian-Muslim violence continued to erupt sporadically in Maluku. The government made no effort to remove Laskar Jihad, the Java-based Muslim militia that arrived in the province by the thousands in 2000. Its members continued to be responsible for human rights violations. In early 2001, evidence emerged of Laskar Jihad forcing several hundred to convert to Islam and circumcising men and women alike. On May 4, the Wahid government finally took action against the head of Laskar Jihad, Jafar Umar Thalib, but not for any of his actions as commander of a private army. Instead, he was charged with murder for sentencing one of his followers to execution by stoning and having a crowd proceed to killed the confessed adulterer. The arrest appeared to prompt a new wave of violence that killed eighteen Christians by the end of May. On June 14, a botched raid by an army battalion on a Laskar Jihad post left twenty-two Muslims dead.On August 8, Megawati's vice-president, Hamzah Haz, made a point of meeting with Jafar Umar Thalib and Laskar Jihad members. While he urged them to abide by the constitution, the meeting gave the group new legitimacy. East and West Timor Little progress was made toward addressing the 1999 violence in East Timor. As of September, some 50,000 East Timorese remained in West Timor. A June 6, 2001 registration conducted by the Indonesian government of that population showed that 98.2 percent elected to stay in Indonesia, but there were serious concerns about whether the refugees had access to full information and whether they were in a position to answer freely. Only """"heads of households"""" (usually taken to mean male) were questioned. Many refugees were expected to return in the aftermath of the peaceful election in East Timor on August 30. No one was brought to justice during the year for crimes committed in East Timor. Half-hearted efforts by the Attorney-General's office during the year to set up an ad hoc tribunal to try people originally named in September 2000 as suspected perpetrators of serious crimes came to nothing. The tribunal needed a recommendation from the parliament to the president and then a presidential instruction. When President Wahid finally issued the instruction in April, it only allowed for prosecution of crimes occurring after the August 30, 1999 referendum. After protests, the instruction was returned to the Ministry of Justice for rewriting. The reworded decree was issued in August by President Megawati in one of her first acts after taking office, but it remained flawed, as it only allowed for prosecution before August 30, 1999 of the few cases that the Attorney General's office had deemed a priority. The ability to look at the whole pattern of state policy, critical to establishing a crimes against humanity case, was thus weakened. Moreover, by the time the new decree came out, the statute of limitations on the East Timor cases had expired, according to the new human rights legislation. While officials in the Megawati government continued to pay lip service to the idea of moving forward with prosecutions, few Indonesian rights activists believed that any of the suspects would ever face trial. In the meantime, the six alleged killers of the three U.N.H.C.R. workers, murdered in Atambua, West Timor, on September 6, 2000 were brought to trial in January 2001. On May 4, they were sentenced to prison terms ranging from ten to twenty months, after having only been accused of assault - although even that charge could have resulted in a twelve-year sentence. The leniency of the charges against them was reportedly the work of the man who became Megawati's Attorney-General, M.A. Rahman, and the leniency of the sentencing caused international outrage. Eurico Gutteres, the East Timorese militia leader responsible for much of the 1999 violence in the city of Dili, was charged in relation to another incident in Atambua that took place on September 24, 2000 shortly after the UNHCR killings. Accused of incitement for resisting efforts of authorities to disarm the militias, he was sentenced to six months in prison by the North Jakarta district court on April 30, 2001 and served only twenty-three days before being released.","Asia, Indonesia",""

In a letter to Justice Minister Omar Azzimane, Human Rights Watch said that the one-year prison sentence and heavy fine imposed on Ahmed Boukhari on August 29 for alleged financial irregularities appears intended to silence him.  The jail sentence also appears intended to ensure that Boukhari will not be able to testify at a September 7 French judicial inquiry into the kidnap-abduction of prominent Moroccan opposition leader Mehdi Ben Barka in Paris in 1965. Boukhari now sits in a Casablanca jail and his request for a passport has gone unanswered.  “Morocco should investigate Boukhari’s charges without delay, and allow him to meet with the French judge,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “Whatever the merit of the charges brought against him, he is potentially a key witness to gross human rights violations.

They then flew his body back to Morocco and dissolved it in a vat of acid.

The 60-page report, Caste Discrimination: A Global Concern, focuses on the Dalits or so-called untouchables of South Asia - including Nepal, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, and Pakistan - as well the Buraku people of Japan, the Osu of Nigeria, and certain groups in Senegal and Mauritania who also suffer from caste-based discrimination. The prominence of caste among South Asian diaspora communities is also revealed.   """"Apartheid may have ended in South Africa, but at least 250 million people worldwide are still living in a situation of segregation and servitude,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"The racism conference cannot ignore this global phenomenon.""""   On August 6, 2001, in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, an upper-caste Brahmin boy and a lower-caste Jat girl were dragged to the roof of a house and publicly hanged by members of their own families as hundreds of spectators looked on. The public lynching was punishment for refusing to end an inter-caste relationship. Despite a high incidence of egregious crimes such as these, the Indian government claims to have tackled the problem and maintains that is an internal matter.   The government has tried to censor discussion of caste at the conference and at all preparatory meetings leading up to it. India has used political and economic influence over other countries to pressure them into a partnership of silence; they have sent numerous people to non-governmental meetings who had clearly received a brief to argue the government's side, and have used influence within UN human rights bodies to sabotage any reference to caste in conference documents.   The report, which is being released at the nongovernmental forum before the racism conference taking place in Durban from August 28-August 31, clearly shows that caste discrimination is a significant bar to basic human rights worldwide. Over 160 Dalit activists from India will be attending the conference, as well as numerous lower-caste advocacy groups from Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Senegal.   Caste denotes a system of rigid social stratification into ranked groups defined by descent and occupation. Under various caste systems throughout the world, caste divisions also dominate in housing, marriage, and general social interaction - divisions that are reinforced through the threat of social ostracism, economic boycotts, and even physical violence.

Mr. Milosevic had charged that the tribunal was illegitimate and selective. A hearing before the war crimes court will take place on Thursday, August 30 to chart the course for Milosevic's trial.   """"This is not victors' justice-this is justice for the victims of horrific crimes,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of International Justice for Human Rights Watch. """"Slobodan Milosevic was at the top of the chain of command of military and security forces that wrought mayhem in Kosovo in early 1999. He needs to be held to account, with all the protections of a fair trial, for the ethnic cleansing and killings there.""""   Human Rights Watch documented scores of killings by Serb forces during the 1998-1999 conflict that took an estimated 10,000 Kosovar Albanian lives. The most egregious abuses took place during the NATO bombing period from March to June 1999 when Serbian and Yugoslav forces conducted a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign in which thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed. Throughout Kosovo villages were systematically cleansed, with long columns of displaced persons leading along roads, into cities and then out of the country.   In his motion of August 9, Mr. Milosevic claimed that the tribunal had no authority over him because """"his extradition violated"""" the constitutions of Yugoslavia and Serbia.   """"The transfer of Milosevic from a Belgrade jail to the Hague was a clear obligation under the United Nations Charter and the 1995 Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in Bosnia.

Under this authority the Security Council has taken many steps, including dispatching peacekeepers to conflict zones, including the former Yugoslavia. On May 25, 1993, the Security Council adopted Resolution 827 establishing a court to try those responsible for the worst crimes committed in the Yugoslav conflict. When an earlier defendant before the tribunal challenged its creation, his claims were unanimously dismissed by Tribunal judges from Italy, Egypt, China, Canada, and Pakistan.     The Security Council also established a similar tribunal to try those responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. The United Nations General Assembly has no such authority.     Question: Is there an """"anti-Serb bias"""" at the Tribunal?    Answer: The Tribunal is empowered to investigate anyone, regardless of nationality, who committed serious crimes in the course of the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. As of March 2001, the Tribunal had publicly indicted 66 individuals, 50 of them Serbs. It recently handed a down a forty-five year prison sentence against a Croatian army general accused of war crimes. From its field investigations of the conduct of all sides to the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia, Human Rights Watch has found that the majority of crimes were committed by Serb forces. Not insignificantly, Serb forces were the only ones to participate in each of the conflicts-in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo.    Question: Can Slobodan Milosevic get a fair trial before this Court, which is strongly supported by NATO countries? Isn't the trial of Milosevic """"victors' justice""""?    Answer: While the tribunal is not perfect (no court is), the ICTY functions according to the highest standards of international justice. This means that Mr. Milosevic will receive all the guarantees necessary for a fair trial. Its proceedings have to date resulted in the acquittal of a number of defendants, including Serbs, on various charges. If the Tribunal falls short in protecting any of Milosevic's rights to mount a vigorous defense, it should be criticized and change its practice.     The ICTY is an international court. The pre-trial judges hearing the initial proceedings are from the United Kingdom, Jamaica, and Morocco. As of April 2001, the Tribunal employed a staff of 1,103 from 74 different countries. While certainly there are citizens from NATO countries serving at all levels of the Tribunal, if there is a specific conflict of interest, that individual should recuse him or herself from the proceedings.    Question: Why hasn't the Tribunal tried NATO officials for war crimes in Yugoslavia?    Answer: The tribunal carried out an investigation into the conduct of NATO forces during the conflict in Kosovo and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a prosecution.     Human Rights Watch itself conducted extensive field research into the 1999 NATO air war against Yugoslavia. We found that 500 civilians were killed and 90 targets were selected inappropriately because they were civilian targets. We concluded that these incidents, which violated the laws of war, did not, however, rise to the more serious level of """"grave breaches"""" or war crimes that the tribunal is empowered to prosecute.     If other evidence of NATO culpability for war crimes does arise, it would be essential for the tribunal to investigate those allegations. If the evidence warrants, the court should investigate and, if need be, prosecute those responsible for the alleged crimes.    Here is HRW's short assessment of what happened on the ground in Kosovo, including the """"chain of command"""" establishing Milosevic's authority.","Europe/Central Asia, Croatia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Boukhari est actuellement incarcéré dans une prison de Casablanca et aucune suite n’a été donnée à sa demande de passeport.  “Le Maroc devrait ouvrir dans les meilleurs délais une enquête sur les accusations portées par Ahmed Boukhari et lui permettre de répondre à la convocation du juge français,” a souligné Hanny Megally, directeur exécutif de la division Moyen-Orient et Maghreb de Human Rights Watch. “Quel que soit le fondement des chefs d’accusation dont il fait l’objet, il pourrait se révéler un témoin capital d’une grave affaire de violation des droits de l’Homme. L’ةtat a le devoir de lui permettre de coopérer avec l’enquête française et ne doit pas y faire obstacle.”  Dans des révélations publiées fin juin dans les médias français et marocains, M. Boukhari a cité les noms de plusieurs agents de la sécurité marocaine qui, selon lui, auraient organisé l’enlèvement de Ben Barka à Paris, où ils l’auraient torturé à mort. Après quoi, ils auraient fait rapatrier son corps en avion au Maroc, puis l’aurait dissout dans une cuve d’acide. A ce jour, le mystère de la disparition de Ben Barka n’a jamais été élucidé.  “La façon dont le Maroc a jusqu’à présent traité Ahmed Boukhari semble totalement contredire les nombreuses déclarations louables du gouvernement sur le respect des droits de l’homme et la gestion honorable des délits passés,” a ajouté M. Megally. “Nous suivrons de très près le traitement qui lui sera réservé.”  Pièce jointe : Copie de la lettre adressée à M.

In a 14-page memorandum released today, Human Rights Watch urged the Bush administration to challenge the Georgian government's failure to address the violence, and called for the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom to visit Georgia and investigate. In early September the administration is due to release its annual report on global religious freedom. """"People should be entitled to worship without fear,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"For two years now these groups have had carte blanche for violence. It's time for the Georgian authorities to start investigating, arresting, charging, and detaining them."""" More than 40 attacks have taken place this year; more than 80 violent incidents have been reported since 1999. The memorandum, based on first hand interviews with victims, documents ten of the attacks that have taken place in 2001. The assailants, civilian militants who are sometimes led by Orthodox priests, have meted out beatings, ransacked homes, and destroyed religious literature. The mobs target Jehovah's Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists, and followers of other Christian faiths non-native to Georgia, attempting to intimidate them into abandoning their faith. Encouraged by government and police inaction, the frequency of attacks is on the rise. President Eduard Shevardnadze has spoken out against the attacks and ordered police and prosecutors to """"identify and punish"""" perpetrators, but the authorities have failed to investigate seriously or make arrests. The leader of the majority of the attacks, Vasili Mkalavishvili, a defrocked Orthodox priest, openly claims to receive help from the police and security services. Police officers have failed to intervene to protect the victims and in some cases the police themselves have violently broken up prayer gatherings. Since last year, mob attacks have spread from Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, to other towns and rural areas. In March of this year an Orthodox priest on horseback led a crowd of 150 in breaking into a private house in the town of Sachkhere, where Jehovah's Witnesses were holding a prayer meeting, and beating worshippers inside. In February, Mkalavishvili and his followers rushed into the courtyard of a private home in Tbilisi and beat Jehovah's Witnesses there with clubs, large crosses and Bibles after police forced open the gate for them. On April 30, Mkalavishvili's supporters broke up another Jehovah's Witnesses prayer meeting in Tbilisi, attacking worshippers with sticks spiked with nails and putting three of them in hospital.  Human Rights Watch said that leading Georgian institutions bear heavy responsibility for creating the atmosphere of hostility and intolerance towards non-Orthodox Christian faiths in which these violent attacks have flourished. Law enforcement agencies' failure to prosecute the perpetrators of such attacks has given a green light for further violence and hostility. The Georgian Orthodox Church has failed to condemn the violence explicitly. Since 1998 it has lobbied for laws to gain special status and to have restrictions placed on other faiths. In February the Supreme Court ruled to deregister the Jehovah's Witnesses as a legal entity in Georgia.  The Supreme Court decision prompted a new surge of violent attacks. Local level police, customs officers and Orthodox priests leapt to interpret the decision as a ban on Jehovah's Witnesses' activities. They have used it variously to disperse prayer meetings, confiscate literature, and to issue new threatening ultimatums.  """"The rule of law is giving way to mob law on this in Georgia,"""" said Andersen.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/28/memorandum-us-government-religious-violence-republic-georgia","Memorandum to the US Government on Religious Violence in the Republic of Georgia","Memorandum to the U.S. Government on Religious Violence in the Republic of Georgia","","08/28/2001","Introduction Non-Orthodox Christian worshippers throughout Georgia have been the targets of at least eighty violent attacks by civilian groups in the past two years. The government has made no serious efforts to criminally investigate—let alone prosecute—the perpetrators, and in some cases, police themselves violently broke up prayer gatherings.  Attacks have grown more frequent with the ensuing atmosphere of impunity.  Assailants stalk worshippers on their way to or from prayer meetings, or break up prayer meetings in private homes. They beat congregants, at times inflicting serious injuries, ransack private homes, destroy property, and burn religious literature.  The assailants target the victims because of their faith and seek to intimidate congregants into abandoning their religious practices. The victims are primarily Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists, and members of the Assembly of God, also known in Georgia as “non-traditional” worshippers. The evidence indicates that many of the attacks have been led or organized by Vasili Mkalavishvili,[1] a priest from Tbilisi who has been deposed by the Georgian Orthodox Church, and his followers. Religious violence is now also perpetrated by people who have no apparent connection with Mkalavishvili, including members of nationalist organizations, church clergy, and those who are simply neighbors of so-called non-traditional congregants. Human Rights Watch interviewed twenty-two victims of religious violence in Georgia in 2001. The government’s failure to address the attacks, documented in this memorandum, violates its obligations under international law. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (article 18) and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (article 9) provide for the right to freedom of religion.  The right to religious freedom includes the “freedom to have or  to adopt a religion or belief of [one’s] choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest [one’s] religious belief in worship, observance, practice and teaching.”[2]  Furthermore, “[n]o one should be subject to coercion which would impair [one’s] freedom to have or adopt a religion or belief of [one’s] choice.”[3] As a party to both conventions, the Georgian government has a duty to guarantee basic rights to religious minorities, to prosecute those who participate in religious violence, and to take administrative or legal measures against officials who are complicit in religious violence or who do not exercise their authority to enforce the criminal law. The government’s failure to uphold these obligations early on no doubt encouraged further acts of religious violence. In the few instances where the government has acted, the measures adopted were too meager and too late to be effective.   Recommendations for United States Policy The U.S. government has responded to religious violence in Georgia chiefly through private expressions of concern to the Georgian government at all levels in bi-lateral relations and in the framework of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.[4] The U.S. State Department’s year 2000 annual Report on International Religious Freedom: Georgia, adequately described religious violence, but glossed over the atmosphere of impunity created by the Georgian government’s failure to act.  The U.S. Embassy in Tbilisi, jointly with the Embassy of the United Kingdom, issued a public statement in response to an incident of police and mob violence in September 2000.[5] While private demarches are welcome, they have been ineffectual in pressing the government of Georgia to take any meaningful action. To address the atmosphere of impunity, the Bush administration should urge the government of Georgia to conduct thorough and impartial investigations of religious violence, and to hold the perpetrators accountable.  It should request the government of Georgia to make publicly availablea case-by-case description of actions taken to investigate and prosecute cases of religious violence. It should encourage the Georgian government to better publicize its own expressions of concern about religious intolerance.   With its mandate under IRFA, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom should make Georgia a priority country and ask the Bush administration for a full accounting of measures taken to express concern about religious violence in Georgia. It should visit Georgia with a view toward making recommendations to the Bush administration for promoting accountability for religious violence and should include a section on Georgia in its next annual report.   Background The majority of ethnic Georgians, who make up about 70 percent of Georgia’s population, are considered to be associated with the Georgian Orthodox Church. Eastern Georgia adopted Christianity as its state religion in 337 A.D., the second state to do so after Armenia.  Many Georgians consider affiliation with Orthodoxy an essential feature of Georgian national identity.[6] On March 30, 2001, parliament amended the constitution to establish relations between the Georgian Orthodox Church and the state on the basis of a concordat, which would grant the Church and its clergy a privileged position in Georgian society.[7] Referred to as “nontraditional faiths,” Jehovah’s Witnesses, Pentacostalists, Baptists, and congregations of other Protestant faiths have been in Georgia for many years.  Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, claim to have been present in Georgia since 1953, while Baptist churches there were established in the nineteenth century. The number of adherents is unknown but is believed to be in the tens of thousands. Georgia has no law expressly regulating the activities of religious organizations. Those critical of non-traditional faiths in Georgia argue that the latter are taking advantage of Georgia’s economic collapse and political troubles to win converts. They take particular offense at what they perceive as aggressive proselytism by these churches. They claim such faiths eradicate Georgian identity and threaten the Georgian nation, sometimes pointing to refusal by adherents of some faiths to serve in the military. Some claim that the practices of non-traditional faiths “defile” the Orthodox Church. While not all citizens who espouse these views took up the call to violence, perpetrators of violence cited these and other justifications for their actions. Vasili Mkalavishvili, for example, recently stated to the BBC: “It is terrible, terrible that today Georgia is being invaded by dark satanic forces of the outside. Many do not understand that Georgia’s salvation is in Orthodoxy, and that those sects, and especially Jehovah’s Witnesses, are trying to destroy our centuries’-long tradition. This is why I and my followers have declared a battle against those sects and we are determined to carry on fighting them.”[8] In March 2001 he declared that: “We won’t allow sectarians to build their Satanic churches”, because: “They are against Orthodoxy and insult Jesus Christ. They are selling out Orthodoxy and the Georgian soul.”[9] Opponents of non-traditional religions who have not participated in violence against their adherents have a range of views.  At a Tbilisi news conference given in July 2000, Guram Sharadze, a member of parliament from the nationalist Georgia First of AllParty who filed a lawsuit which resulted in the de-registration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses in Georgia, alleged that they were spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to undermine Orthodox Christianity in Georgia and, bizarrely, that they were receiving covert support from the city’s American-managed electricity company.[10] Patriarch Ilia II, the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, has cited the growth of “sects” in Georgia to argue for closer cooperation between the Georgian Orthodox Church and the government.  The Georgian Orthodox Church to date has not condemned religious violence against non-traditional faiths.  In July 2001, in response to a June attack in Martvili that involved church clergy, Patriarch Ilia II said, “the Georgian Orthodox Church works within the bounds that are acceptable to the Orthodox Church, which is peaceful treatment.” [11]  From Intolerance to Violence: 1999 -2000 Organized violence against non-Orthodox Christian denominations followed attempts in 1998 and 1999 by the Georgian Orthodox Church to lobby the government to restrict these denominations’ activities,[12] as well as several highly publicized actions, some violent, by government agents who sought to break up such activities. The run-up to Georgia’s October 1999 parliamentary elections marked a watershed in official intolerance toward non-traditional faiths, and was the context for the first incidents of citizen violence.  On May 4,1999, Guram Sharadze filed suit in Tbilisi’s Isani-Samgori district court to annul the Jehovah’s Witnesses registration,[13] arguing initially that the organization threatened the Georgian state and national identity.  After the court ruled that Jehovah’s Witnesses literature constituted no threat to the state, he argued that deregistration was required by Georgia’s lack of a law on religion.[14] The court in February 2000 ruled against Sharadze. But on June 27, 2000, an appeals court reversed the district court’s decision in a ruling which served to annul the Jehovah’s Witnesses’ registration. On February 22, 2001, the Supreme Court of Georgia upheld the appeals’ court ruling, holding that because the Jehovah’s Witnesses is a religious organization it could not, as it had been, be registered as a “legal entity of private law” under the civil code.[15] The Supreme Court ruling stated that deregistration meant neither the banning of the organization and its activities, nor a restriction of its members’  “freedom to change their belief, either alone or jointly with others, either publicly or in private” and “freedom to manifest their religion or beliefs, from the viewpoint of religious teachings and having rituals.” Some commentators expressed the view that the initial lawsuit and the ensuing violence were intended to exploit voter discontent with the Georgian government’s failure to curb rampant corruption and raise living standards.  After the lawsuit was filed, law enforcement agencies broke up non-traditional religious gatherings and seized their literature. On May 29, 1999, for example, police in the Gldani district of Tbilisi violently broke up a prayer meeting of the Assembly of God, threatening and beating several participants.[16]  In July and August, Georgian customs police impounded six tons of Jehovah’s Witnesses’ religious literature, claiming that the organization’s registration had been revoked.  The materials were released in December, after the Jehovah’s Witnesses filed suit against the customs service. The first major mob assault took place in on October 17, 1999 in Tbilisi’s Gldani district. It was led by Vasili Mkalavishvili, a priest deposed by the Georgian Orthodox Church Patriarchate, who heads what he calls the Gldani Orthodox Eparchy.[17]  The attack left least sixteen people injured, several seriously.[18] Incredibly, the state prosecuted two of the victims, who were convicted on charges of hooliganism, whereas the perpetrators were acquitted of charges of destruction of property.[19] During the trial Mkalavishvili supporters assaulted human rights defenders, a journalist, and Jehovah’s Witnesses who were in attendance. Among those beaten were Giga Bokeria and Kote Vardzelashvili, both of the Liberty Institute, a Georgian nongovernmental human rights organization dedicated to defending freedom of expression. The day before, on August 16, 2000, Radio Liberty/ Radio Free Europe correspondent Sozar Subeliani was reportedly assaulted and beaten as he attempted to cover the trial. Canadian human rights lawyer John Burns, who was monitoring the trial as a representative of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, also said in a written statement that he was dragged to the ground and struck with a large wooden cross after Mkalavishvili’s supporters burst into the court room. They stalked and beat Jehovah’s Witnesses in the months that followed, at first chiefly in the Gldani district, and then throughout Tbilisi. At least two other assaults by Mkalavishvili and his supporters followed in 1999, and violent incidents escalated in 2000: the Jehovah’s Witnesses organization claims that thirty-eight incidents took place in 2000.  Mkalavishvili’s followers were alleged to be involved in the majority of attacks. In several cases, police were involved in violence against non-traditional worshippers. Twice in September 2000, police attempted to prevent Jehovah’s Witnesses from mounting large conventions, and stood by idly as organized groups of people attacked those who had tried to gather; some police allegedly beat the congregants. On September 8, police stopped vehicles taking Jehovah’s Witnesses to a convention in Zugdidi, and violently dispersed those who hadgathered. According to the U.S. State Department, the Zugdidi incident was under investigation, but the results are unknown.[20] On September 16, police turned back nineteen vehicles transporting Jehovah’s Witnesses to a convention in Marneuli, about twenty-five kilometers south of Tbilisi. They failed to stop mobs that descended on the convoy at the roadblock, dragged some of the congregants off the buses and beat them; some victims claimed police beat them as well. The mob looted the convention site. Although Mkalavishvili has been indicted for interfering with religious services and violating public order (see below), he and his followers have had little to fear from law enforcement agencies, which have been notoriously unresponsive to episodes of violence and patently unwilling to protect non-traditional religious believers.  On some occasions, Mkalavishvili has given public warnings of impending attacks; in September 2000, he boasted on the popular “60 Minutes” weekly investigative reporting program, broadcast on Rustavi-2 TV, that he would break up the Marneuli assembly.  In a statement broadcast on Georgian television in May 2001, after he was indicted, Mkalavishvili said that while he would no longer be directly involved in incidents against non-traditional faiths, his followers would continue to do so upon his instructions.[21] During a live television call-in program aired on July 24, Mkalavishvili gave his “blessing to stop Jehovah’s Witnesses in the street or wherever they see them, confiscate their literature and burn it in front to them,” using violence if necessary.[22] An August 2001 BBC program cited Mkalavishvili's boasting of support from Georgia’s law enforcement agencies. He said, “ Thank God that among our security services and policemen there are people who are willing to help me: they realize how dangerous it is to have these sects in Georgia.” [23] Human Rights Watch has a leaflet believed to originate with Mkalavishvili’s group, found in Tbilisi in March 2001, that warns Jehovah’s Witnesses not to gather. Such leaflets are distributed in areas where Jehovah’s Witnesses plan to assemble. The leaflet reads: A Fatal Warning to All Sects that Defy the Holy Spirit: Temporary leader of Gldani Orthodoxy Eparchy Father Basili Mkalavishvili with his large number of followers strictly warns various sects like Jehovah’s Witnesses, Evangelists, Baptists, Adventists, and Krishnaite… to stop anti-Orthodox activities in Georgia, stop satanic mass meetings against the true Orthodox faith. We call for the Georgian Orthodox nation not to let sectarian meetings take place and to actively defend our ancestors’ Christian belief.  Gldani Orthodox press service. This is the last warning.  Escalation of Religious Violence in 2001 Given the government’s poor record on prosecuting perpetrators of religious violence in 2000, and the police action taken to disrupt non-traditional activities, the rapid escalation of attacks in 2001 is unsurprising. A notable spike in the violence occurred after the Supreme Court’s February 22, 2001 decision on the deregistration of Jehovah’s Witnesses. According to the Jehovah’s Witnesses, forty attacks took place in the first seven months of 2001, more than had occurred throughout 2000; most happened after February 22. Whereas attacks in 1999 and early 2000 were concentrated primarily in Tbilisi and its Gldani district, they later spread to other towns and rural areas of Georgia.  Police were involved in some of the incidents. Human Rights Watch interviewed twenty-two victims of eight different acts of religious violence. Mkalavishvili and his followers have been implicated in most of the attacks, but increasingly they are perpetrated by other nationalist organizations, church clergy, and simply neighbors of non-traditional congregants. In seven cases documented by Human Rights Watch, Jehovah’s Witnesses had attempted to hold small prayer meetings in private homes; in one incident they were holding a modified congress. In one attack, the assailants beat congregants with wooden clubs spiked with nails. Police in one case cleared the way for mobs to attack worshipers.  In no case did police take effective action to prevent or stop the violence, or diligently to investigate it.  Attacks in Tbilisi On February 27, five days after the Supreme Court decision upholding the deregistration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, about 300 Jehovah’s Witnesses gathered at 10:00 a.m. in the courtyard of a private home in the Isani district of Tbilisi for a prayer meeting. At about 3:00 p.m., a group of about fifteen to twenty people led by Basili Mkalavishvili broke up the assembly, breaking into the courtyard and beating those inside. According to Rudolph Mikirtumov, a Jehovah’s Witness who was at the gathering, between twenty and thirty policemen were at the scene, but instead of deterring or stopping the attack, they forced open the courtyard gates, allowing the assailants to enter the courtyard.   Mikirtumov, an unemployed tailor, told Human Rights Watch that police had told him that they came to the gathering  “to protect [the Jehovah’s Witnesses] from any possible incidents. At noon Rustavi2 TV showed the assembly on the news, and a bit later the police came.” At 3:00 p.m. the Jehovah’s Witnesses group received a phone call from other Jehovah’s Witnesses who had just left the assembly, warning the group that Mkalavishvili and his supporters were on their way to the gathering. Mikirtumov immediately warned the police and asked for help, to which one policeman reportedly replied, “We can’t get beaten up instead of you.” Mikirtumov then went inside the courtyard to secure the wires that held the gate closed.  Several minutes later, Mkalavishvili’s group arrived, but had trouble opening the gate. Three men in plainclothes then jumped over the gate, two showing police badges and saying they were officers, and the third identifying himself as an officer. One of the men bearing a badgeforced the gate open, saying he needed to let other police officers in. The attackers rushed through the gate and beat those gathered, using clubs, large crosses, and Bibles. Within thirty minutes, the house was ransacked.  Mikirtumov sustained multiple injuries to his face, which required his brief hospitalization. Mikirtumov told Human Rights Watch that instead of questioning him about the details of the attack, procuracy investigators said that local residents had been complaining about the noise level at the gathering, an allegation Mikirtumov believes was fabricated in order to intimidate and dissuade him from pursuing any complaint. They also reportedly stated that information he provided about police having forced open the gate for the attackers was “unnecessary.” One of the most vicious incidents in Tbilisi took place on April 30, 2001, when a group wielding sticks spiked with nails broke up a prayer meeting in the Svanetisubani district of Tbilisi. The attackers broke windows, furniture and electrical equipment, beat worshippers with the spiked sticks, and burned religious literature in a large bonfire on the street. As a result, three victims were hospitalized. Among them was Tamaz Nachkebia, who sustained multiple contusions and whose head injuries required five stitches. A Human Rights Watch representative saw the open wounds to Nachkebia’s left hand, right arm, left foot, as well as the bruises to his right ribcage and left cheek.[24] Nachkebia told Human Rights Watch what happened to him: “About ten people were beating me, I was lying on the floor and could not move.” He also said that the attackers were shouting, “Hit everybody, these little snakes are sons of the devil!”[25] Some of the attackers wore masks that slipped off. Two eyewitnesses identified the attackers as well-known followers of Mkalavishvili.[26] According to an eyewitness, Zviad Dzadzamia, when the attack started one of the congregants phoned the police, who allegedly retorted,  “Serves you right, why were you meeting?” According to both Dzadzamia and Nachkebia, a police squad arrived while the attack was in progress, but left without explanation. About a half hour later, another police squad arrived—by this time the assailants had fled—and asked witnesses to write statements. To our knowledge no witnesses were called for questioning, and no one has been arrested in relation to the assault. According to Dzadzamia and Nachkebia, Jemal Gamakharia, a member of parliament from the national opposition Georgian Revival Party, witnessed the attack. When Dzadzamia asked him what he thought of what was going on, Gamakharia allegedly responded, “You deserve it; the worst is yet to come.”[27] On May 20, about thirty people believed by eyewitnesses to be followers of Mkalavishvili attacked about sixty people gathered to pray in an apartment in the Mukhiani district of Tbilisi. According to an eyewitness, Zaur Malania, one of the victims was a pregnant woman; another was a seventeen-year-old boy who suffered a concussion and required hospitalization.[28] Another eyewitness, Bakuri Biuglishvili, told Human Rights Watch that he phoned the police, saying that a robbery was in progress. Police arrived within minutes, which is highly unusual in Georgia, caught five of the assailants, took them into custody, released them from custody within a half hour, and asked nine witnesses to write statements. To our knowledge, no questioning took place. Malania told Human Rights Watch that he periodically inquires about the case, but that no criminal charges had been filed.[29] On June 17, a group of fifty or sixty men and women attacked a prayer meeting of eighty-six people in the Ortachala district of Tbilisi. The attackers beat the congregants, several of whom required medical treatment, and burned furniture, personal property, and religious literature on the street. Giorgi Kiknavelidze, a twenty-six-year-old economist, sustained multiple bruises and contusions, mostly to the shoulders and legs. He told Human Rights Watch that the attack seemed very well planned: They all knew what to do; some of them searched for literature, others beat people, while others made a human gauntlet to the door and assaulted everybody who tried to escape…. The whole attack lasted about ten to fifteen minutes… An Ikarus model bus and one mini-bus were waiting outside and that’s how they [the assailants] fled.[30] An eyewitness, Nana Robakidze, an unemployed veterinarian, was able to flee the violence. Her husband, who sustained several bruises to his back, went to the Ponichala police station and returned to the scene with two police officers. “The attackers were still there, getting ready to leave, but police would not act. And only when the mob left, they started asking questions, like why we were gathered, what we wanted.”[31] Robakidze, who is thirty-one, said she was not questioned by police about the incident. Kiknavelidze named five of the attackers, all Mkalavishvili followers, but noted that Mkalavishvili himself was not present. That evening he reported the incident to the Mtatsmindia-Krtsanisi district police. To our knowledge, no investigation is under way.  Attacks outside Tbilisi  Martvili (Western Georgia) Two priests and their parishioners assaulted a group of Jehovah’s Witnesses on their way to a prayer meeting on the morning of June 8, 2001. Kakha Vashakidze, an unemployed economist who serves as the prayer group leader, had arrived early at the home where the prayer meeting was to take place.  At about noon, four female congregants arrived, telling Vashakidze that two priests, whom Vashakidze identified by name, and their parishioners had been blocking the road leading to the prayer gathering; the crowd, according to the women, shouted insults and struck the Jehovah’s Witnesses who were attempting to pass.[32] The hostess for the prayer meeting complained immediately to the local police chief, who reportedly said that the group had no legal right to gather since they were banned, an oblique reference to the February Supreme Court ruling. Four policemen accompanied her home, to ensure that Vashakidze would leave and that the prayer meeting therefore would not take place.  Police formed a cordon through which they instructed Vashakidze to leave the house. As he left, one of the priests implicated in the attack warned Vashakidze not to hold any more meetings on that street because it led to a church, which he said made it holy. “He said if we held any more meetings there he would not be responsible for the consequences,” Vashakidze told Human Rights Watch. One week later Vashakidze returned to the police station with copies of the constitution and the Supreme Court decision, which states that deregistration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses does not mean denial of their right to gather for prayer. The police officer in charge of the case told Vashakidze to take the documents to the priest and discuss it with him. The following week, Vashakidze returned to the station for further discussions. On that occasion, the priest reportedly threatened, in the presence of the police chief, to use “Basili’s methods” (a reference to Mkalavishvili) if the Jehovah’s Witnesses attempted to hold another prayer meeting in that area on that street.     Sachkhere In another incident involving clergy, on March 6, 2001, a group of about 150 people, which included four priests from a local parish, attacked a prayer meeting in the town of Sachkhere, about 270 kilometers northwest of Tbilisi. Savle Gotsadze told Human Rights Watch that on March 5 he was on his way to the home of the B. family, when he saw a mob of people and the four priests, whom he recognized as being from the local parish, in their clerical garb, outside B’s building.[33]  The priests and several members of the crowd went to B’s apartment, where they warned the family not to hold prayer meetings there, and claimed that the patriarchate had authorized them to break up any such gatherings. Gotsadze said that the laymen also struck B. The next day, March 6, the crowd attacked the prayer gathering at B’s home, breaking household items and burning religious literature. The crowd broke into another building on B’s property, which had been used as the meeting room, looting the premises and burning religious literature. Gotsadze said: There were about 150 people led by a priest on horseback….They started to break the doors… For a moment people stopped, but then one priest cried, “What are you doing?! Why did you stop?” That’s when the mob got violent. I asked them not to touch the hostess… and then I was caught and they started beating me, saying that I talk too much. I fell down and they punched and kicked me….  The hostess, Nana, also got severely beaten. Gotsadze told Human Rights Watch that a forensic doctor examined him for injuries he sustained during the attack.  While the chief of police expressed regret to Gotsadze and B. about the incident, to our knowledge, no investigation is under way.  Borjomi District On April 1, 2001 a crowd of fifteen accosted Jehovah’s Witnesses as they were returning from a prayer meeting in the village of Dviri, about 150 kilometers west of Tbilisi. Present during the assault was the village administrator, who upbraided the Jehovah’s Witnesses for holding the meeting. Boris Gogoladze told Human Rights Watch that just after the prayer meeting dispersed, as he was on his way home, a group of people drove up in separate cars.[34] Someone called out to him, and when Gogoladze approached, a man whom he identified by name grabbed his bookbag, hit him in the face, ripped off the strap, and began to hit other Jehovah’s Witnesses who were waiting at a nearby bus stop.[35]  The other members of the crowd observed and allegedly swore at the Jehovah’s Witnesses. The attacker then turned again on Gogoladze, striking him and seizing his religious literature. “The chief administrator of the village shouted at me, ‘why are you still gathering, don’t you see what happens to you?’” The incident ended when the deputy administrator of the city of Borjomi told the attacker to stop.  Rustavi On April 7, 2001 a group of about twenty people— led by Paata Bluashvili, a member of “Cross,” an ultra-orthodox organization whose explicit aim is to prevent the spread of non-traditional confessions in Georgia—broke up a prayer gathering in Rustavi, ransacking the apartment where the gathering was held, and beating those gathered and neighbors who came to their defense. The mob also seized and burned religious literature in a bonfire. About sixty people had gathered in a private apartment in Rustavi for the prayer meeting; about ten minutes after the meeting started, the mob burst into the apartment, according to Ardoteli Kviria, an eyewitness.[36] Kviria then went with five other congregants to file a complaint with the Rustavi police (first precinct), who, according to Kviria, accused the Jehovah’s Witnesses of violating public order by meeting in a private home. The victims were asked to write explanatory statements; to our knowledge no investigation into the attack is under way. Another attack on a prayer meeting, held April 29, was led by the congregants’ neighbors.  The congregants had begun to disperse after hearing threats shouted through the door. Ilia Eterishvili said he and others had tried to escape through the windows, but that the neighbors beat them as they got outside. “They verbally and physically assaulted me for about ten minutes… they took all our bags, books, and personal belongings and made a fire right in the yard and burned everything.”[37] Eterishvili said he reported the incident the next day to the police, who instructed him to write an explanatory statement; no investigation followed.  The Response by Georgian Authorities In 2001 Georgian officials at the highest level have condemned violence against non-traditional faiths, but throughout the past two years have failed to take action to stop the attacks, to discipline police and local authorities complicit in the attacks, or to protect congregants from further attacks and protect their right to freedom of religion.  A March 22, 2001 presidential decree, intended to stem a new crime wave of kidnappings, attacks on foreigners, and trafficking of contraband, also addressed religious violence. Among other things, it ordered the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the General Procuracy, and the Ministry of State Security to stop crimes motivated by religion and “to take extraordinary measures to identify and punish those guilty.”[38] Notably, the decree’s preamble cited the damage inflicted on Georgia’s international reputation by the deteriorating crime situation. President Eduard Shevardnadze hosted a meeting of seven religious leaders on July 10, 2001 that aimed to find a common strategy for combating religious violence, and reportedly attributed the wave of violence to people’s susceptibility to extremism, brought on by their poverty.[39] Reacting to the spike in violent incidents following its ruling upholding the deregistration of the Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Georgian Supreme Court condemned the “acts of vandalism” perpetrated by Mkalavishvili “and other expressions of religious extremism and intolerance…”[40] The Supreme Court also called on “all law enforcement structures to take appropriate measures against those persons who place themselves above the law and because of religious motives take it upon themselves [to] execute ‘justice.’ Such acts are not only illegal, but they also create a serious danger for the public and the State.” The statement denied any causal link between its February 27, 2001 decision and the escalation in religious intolerance, noting that while its ruling deregistered the Jehovah’s Witnesses, it did not restrict their right to practice their faith.[41] However, this aspect of the February ruling received relatively little coverage in the official or independent media, and there are many instances, including those documented by Human Rights Watch, in which local officials have cited the Supreme Court decision as justification for barring prayer gatherings and the like.  On March 30, the same day it adopted a constitutional amendment establishing a concordat between the Georgian Orthodox Church and the state, parliament adopted a resolution condemning religious violence. Also, Human Rights Ombudswoman Nana Devdariani has repeatedly condemned the violence. While welcome, these statements came far too late and have had little impact. As of this writing, not a single perpetrator of religious violence has been successfully prosecuted. While the victims of religious violence can often identify their attackers, when police react at all to such incidents, most often they do little more than take statements from victims. As noted above, two Mkalavishvili supporters were acquitted on charges of property damage in relation to the October 17, 1999 attack. Under pressure from the international community, Georgian authorities on March 30 charged Mkalavishvili with interfering with religious services[42] and violating public order.[43] The General  Procuracy transferred to the Tbilisi City Procuracy ten criminal cases— encompassing seventeen violent incidents—that involve Mkalavishvili. It is unclear which incidents are at issue; the Tbilisi City Procuracy declined a request by the Liberty Institute for information on the subject, citing, inexplicably, the presumption of innocence. Mkalavishvili is currently under a restraining order not to leave the Tbilisi city limits prior to trial. He has not abided by the order, continues publicly to direct his supporters to break up religious gatherings, and continues to make public announcements to this effect.[44] No trial date has been scheduled in any of the cases involving Mkalavishvili. Human Rights Watch has on several occasions requested information from the Georgian government about steps taken to bring to justice those responsible for the  attacks and foster a climate of religious tolerance.[45]  To date, we have received no response.

While the concordat itself has not yet been adopted, under a recent draft, privileges accorded to the Georgian Orthodox Church would include a recognition in law that its clergy would be exempted from military service, the creation of Georgian Orthodox Church chaplains for the military and prisons, and programs for teaching Orthodox doctrine in public schools.  Also under discussion is vesting in the Georgian Orthodox Church exclusive authority to grant permits for the construction of any orthodox church.

[12] According to the Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 2000: Georgia, published by the United States Department of State’s Bureau of Democracy Human Rights and Labor, “the Georgian Orthodox Church lobbied Parliament and the Government for laws that would grant it special status and restrict the activities of missionaries from ‘nontraditional’ religions. Various draft laws, some modeled on the Russian law on religion, have been rejected by Parliament.” The report also describes the arrest, and subsequent release, of a Jehovah’s Witnesses representative in Abkhazia. It is worthwhile to note that in 1998 the Russian parliament adopted a law that privileged the Russian Orthodox Church and severely restricted the activities of many “non-traditional” religious organizations.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/28/cote-divoire-politicians-incite-ethnic-conflict","Cte dIvoire- Politicians Incite Ethnic Conflict"," Côte d'Ivoire: Politicians Incite Ethnic Conflict","Racism Conference Should Condemn Abidjan's Xenophobia ","08/28/2001","(New York) - Leading government officials in Côte d'Ivoire have incited a violent xenophobia that is threatening to destabilize the country, Human Rights Watch charged in a new report released today.   The World Conference Against Racism, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance, which begins in Durban on August 31, should condemn the Ivorian leaders who have promoted intolerance based on ethnic and religious differences.   The 70-page report, """"The New Racism: The Political Manipulation of Ethnicity in Côte d'Ivoire,"""" describes atrocities committed during presidential and parliamentary elections in October and December 2000, and is based on extensive interviews of victims and witnesses in Abidjan in late 2000 and early 2001. The report documents more than 200 killings, as well as torture, rape, and arbitrary detention. The political and social climate remains volatile today as intolerance and xenophobia continue to shape daily life.   """"Africans have often been the victims of racism, but they can also be its perpetrators,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"In Côte d'Ivoire we see the kind of intolerance and bigotry that the Racism Conference is designed to address. The Ivorian leaders and security forces responsible for these atrocities must be widely condemned, and brought to justice.""""   The election violence began with security forces targeting civilians on the basis of these political affiliations. Following Gbagbo's victory, security forces began targeting civilians solely and explicitly on the basis of their religion, ethnic group, or national origin.   The overwhelming majority of victims come from the largely Muslim north of the country, or are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants to Côte d'Ivoire. About one-quarter of the population of Cote d'Ivoire was born abroad or is descended from immigrants. Opposition leader Alassane Ouattara and his party, the Rassemblement des Républicains (RDR), largely draw their support from these groups.   In an incident that was widely reported in October 2000, security forces massacred fifty-seven young men, who were then buried in a mass grave in a forest on the outskirts of Abidjan. The new Human Rights Watch report uncovers many more atrocities committed by security forces during the electoral period. These include:  The gunning down of civilians in several smaller massacres;  The torture of hundreds of detainees held by police and gendarme; and The disappearance of at least fifteen young men and the sexual abuse by gendarmes and police of numerous young women.  On August 3, 2001, following a flawed trial, a military tribunal in Abidjan acquitted the eight gendarmes accused of the October 2000 massacre on the grounds of """"lack of evidence."""" The prosecutor says he will appeal the verdict and take the case to a civilian court where survivors might be more willing to testify. No other members of the security forces alleged to be responsible for abuses have been charged. Instead, President Gbagbo announced that a national """"Forum of Reconciliation"""" would take place on September 7, 2000.   International condemnation of the killings of the fifty-seven young men has largely focused on pursuing justice in this case alone, while there has been relatively little international attention to pursuing justice in the scores of other atrocities documented in the report.   Since 1995, when then-President Henri Bédié first invoked a conception of """"Ivorité,"""" or """"Ivorian-ness,"""" there have been several outbreaks of violence against people of foreign descent.   Military ruler General Guei, who briefly took power following a coup in late 1999, had introduced a constitutional amendment that required any presidential candidate to have both parents born in Côte d'Ivoire. The amendment was transparently designed to exclude Ouattara, the leader of the strongest opposition party. Just before the presidential elections, a controversial Supreme Court decision disqualified fourteen of the nineteen candidates on citizenship grounds, including Ouattara.   Laurent Gbagbo, who claimed victory in the presidential elections when Guei fled the country in the midst of protests at his attempts to rig the result, used the same standard of parental citizenship to ensure that Ouattara was once again not allowed to run during the December parliamentary elections.   """"The exploitation of ethnic divisions for political gain is all too familiar in Africa,"""" said Takirambudde. """"When politicians incite hatred to further their own careers, the victims are the people they should be serving. Ivorian leaders should step back from this course now, before it is too late.""""   Human Rights Watch urged President Gbagbo to direct the justice ministry to promptly investigate, prosecute, and punish those responsible for these serious violations of human rights. Human Rights Watch further called on President Gbagbo to ensure that his tenure is characterized by the rule of law - and not by military impunity.   Selected Testimonies   An elderly Malian man, apparently detained because he was wearing a Muslim robe, was one of fourteen men gunned down in October 2000. He recounted the incident of which he claims to be the only survivor. His account was verified by several others living within view of where the killings took place:  On Thursday October 26, at around 2:00 p.m. I left my house to do an errand. On my way I saw the gendarmes were all around. A minute later they saw me and ordered me to come to them. They said they were going to kill me because I'm a Dioula, because I'm a Muslim. I was wearing my bobo [robe] and slippers so they knew I was a Muslim. After hearing that I took off running across the railway line but was unfortunately caught by another gendarme. I begged them to forgive me - I shouldn't really have to ask forgiveness for anything but I figured my life was more important than my pride. The gendarme who'd caught me told me to lie down on the railway and then the others said, no, I should join another group of prisoners nearby. As I was led to this place I saw there were thirteen prisoners; even though I'm old my mind is sharp and I took time to count. The gendarmes were all around and they kept pointing their guns at us. When I arrived they told me to take off my bobo and lay down on the grass with the others. While lying there the gendarmes asked our nationality, which is how I came to know there was also one Burkinabé and one Mauritanian among us. One of them said, """"all of you are RDR, all of you are Dioula."""" They beat us for about thirty minutes. They kicked and beat us with the thick iron buckles of their red belts. They were especially tough on the younger men but left me alone because I'm old. We were asking pardon and telling them we were sorry. One gendarme came by and said, """"Haven't you killed these people yet?""""  A 17-year old young woman, an RDR supporter, who was gang-raped by ten gendarmes and several militant FPI youths, said:  The gendarmes raped us right there in the courtyard on the grass and dirt. They told us to lie down and said, """"and you say you want a Burkinabé president; just wait and see what we do to you."""" First one raped me and then when I tried to get up another would push me down and get on top of me. About ten gendarmes raped me. A few of them also made me take their penises in my mouth. When they were finished they called the youth from FPI and asked, """"who wants to make love with them?"""" and then several of them came and raped us as well. Maybe even ten of them. I don't remember. It all became a blur. At one point one of the youths put sand in my sex. They really mistreated the wife of the caretaker. She screamed that she was not in the march but they kept saying they didn't care. One of the gendarmes told the caretaker to get a machete and cut off a small branch from a banana tree. Then they told her to put the branch inside her sex. They forced her poor husband to watch. Some of the gendarmes doing the raping had two """"V""""s [sergeant] and others had two bars [first lieutenant].","Africa, Côte d'Ivoire","Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape, Religious Freedom"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/27/justice-what-people-aceh-should-get-jakarta","Justice Is What the People of Aceh Should Get From Jakarta","Justice Is What the People of Aceh Should Get From Jakarta","","08/27/2001","When President Megawati Sukarnoputri visits the province of Aceh early next month, she can promise what she likes, but she must deliver justice.   Aceh, a rich province of more than 4 million people, has been wracked for decades by a conflict between Indonesian troops and pro-independence guerrillas from the Free Aceh Movement, known by its Indonesian initials as GAM. The conflict has escalated dramatically since the fall of President Suharto in 1998. More than a thousand people, most of them civilians, have been killed so far this year.   To many Indonesians the war represents a threat to national unity; the rebels, and Acehnese more generally, get little sympathy from the Indonesian public. GAM's attacks on non-Acehnese have not helped.   But that does not make a military solution the answer. In fact, abuses by the police and army have fueled support for independence among ordinary Acehnese.   If the war has reached a critical juncture, it is at least in part because no action has been taken against Indonesian military forces responsible for murder, rape, disappearances and prolonged arbitrary detention of thousands of Acehnese from 1990 onward. More troops are not the answer.   In her national day speech on Aug. 17, Mrs. Megawati apologized to the people of Aceh for their suffering. She sent a high-level ministerial team to Aceh last week, although the largely ceremonial tour was widely scorned. She has agreed to release rebel negotiators detained in late July just before she took office. The detentions all but killed a """"dialogue"""" between the government and GAM leaders.   Mrs. Megawati may revoke the decree of her predecessor that set current military operations in motion. She is actively promoting a new law giving Aceh more autonomy than other provinces in Indonesia, although much of it is giving new names to existing institutions. Nevertheless, the message has got through that Aceh matters.   But is this for real or just for show? The Acehnese could be forgiven for being skeptical. Mrs. Megawati's predecessors, Presidents B.J. Habibie and Abdurrahman Wahid, both visited Aceh and apologized for abuses that occurred from 1990 to 1998, but nothing happened. They set up fact-finding commissions, but no one was held accountable. No safeguards were put in place to prevent new abuses from happening.   Quite the opposite. The Wahid government authorized a new military offensive. While the offensive appeared to have inflicted heavy blows on GAM, it also provided a cover for detaining many nonviolent political activists and human rights monitors.   Mrs. Megawati could go to Aceh with more concrete proposals. She could announce the establishment of a human rights court in Medan, northern Sumatra, near Aceh. Such a court was authorized by a November 2000 law to try cases of widespread or systematic abuses in Aceh that occurred after the law was passed. She and her team would have to make a major push to appoint the judges, but it could be done.   She could offer to make relevant government and military files from 1990 to 1998 available to lawyers interested in prosecuting past abuses. She could announce a withdrawal of the hated paramilitary police troops who have been responsible for some of the worst abuses. She could announce that in the interests of freedom of expression, her administration would henceforth eschew any prosecution of political activists or others involved in peaceful pro-independence demonstrations.   Mrs. Megawati could commit her government to publishing a list once a month of all police and military personnel disciplined for wrongdoing in Aceh. She could announce the establishment of a central register of detainees, so that families no longer have to go to hospitals and police stations looking for missing relatives. She could press for the immediate prosecution of four military officers detained since late December 2000 in connection with the murder in North Aceh of three humanitarian workers from an organization working on behalf of torture victims.   This is not to say that only the Indonesian forces have been responsible for abuses. If there is any opportunity in Aceh for the new government in Jakarta today, it is because the Acehnese public, long fed up with the abuses that have accompanied Jakarta's de facto martial law, is showing signs of being fed up with the rebels as well.   Parliamentarians, journalists, independent human rights investigators and humanitarian aid groups are increasingly reporting intimidation from GAM as well as from the government. The popular local newspaper Serambi Indonesia has been closed twice in three months by GAM threats.   But it is the behavior of government forces that Mrs. Megawati, as president and commander in chief, has the direct power to address. If she makes a ceremonial visit devoid of substance, it will only strengthen Acehnese contempt for Jakarta.  Sidney Jones is Asia Director of Human Rights Watch.","Asia, Indonesia","Torture"

The U.N. World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will meet in Durban, South Africa, from August 31 to September 7.  """"Racism today is a pervasive problem which affects every society,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"We are expecting governments to commit to concrete national and global programs to stamp out racism in all its forms.""""  Human Rights Watch criticized the United States for warning other countries that the conference should not lead to any new programs to combat racism, any new legal standards, or any additional money to fund anti-racism efforts.  """"Victims of racism around the world expect more than empty talk -- they expect action,"""" said Brody.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/26/colombias-zone-fear-0","Colombias Zone of Fear","Colombia's Zone of Fear","","08/26/2001","There is a place in this hemisphere where people vanish without a trace. Fear is so pervasive that few are willing to meet publicly with international human rights investigators. It is as large as Switzerland, but ruled by the gun. That place is the zone ceded by the Colombian government to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC), Latin America's oldest and largest insurgent group. In November 1998 Colombian President Andres Pastrana ceded to the rebels five municipalities in southern Colombia, hoping to further talks aimed at negotiating an end to decades of armed conflict. International attention has focused primarily on human rights abuses committed by right-wing paramilitaries, which operate with the tolerance and even open support of units in Colombia's military. Acting with impunity, paramilitaries commit gross atrocities in Colombia and are responsible for most civilian massacres. But guerrillas also deserve condemnation for the barbarity that is sweeping Colombia. Prior to withdrawing soldiers and police, Colombia's leaders did nothing to establish mechanisms to protect the rights of the estimated 90,000 residents of the zone. Guerrillas forced out employees of the attorney general's office, who would normally investigate and prosecute allegations of crimes. So far, the Colombians living in the zone have paid a high price for these mistakes. During a mission to the zone in May and June of 2000, Human Rights Watch gathered evidence showing that the FARC has abducted and threatened residents, committed extrajudicial executions and recruited children for combat. One of the most dramatic cases involved a teenager, Guillermo Lombana Lizcano. According to his family, Lombana was abducted by the FARC on April 16, 1999, in front of his home in San Vicente del Caguan, the unofficial capital of the zone and its most populated urban center. His father, also named Guillermo, said that the family watched as guerrillas seized the boy. """"My son went out to talk to a friend, and they were waiting for him. Two of them grabbed him while one stood aside. They put him in a taxi. We ran outside because friends had yelled, 'Look, they're taking your boy!' We hadn't had any threats from the FARC. We never had any kind of problem with them. It was a surprise."""" Since then Lombana has searched doggedly, but guerrillas have never told him what happened to his son. Cases such as Lombana's would qualify as forced disappearances under international human rights law if they were carried out by government officials or groups acting with government support. But the fact that these abuses do not qualify at the moment as a violation of specific human rights treaties should not lead to any confusion about their nature. These abductions are serious violations of international law and should spur international outrage. Outside the zone, the FARC is equally abusive. Last year human rights groups reported that rebels killed 496 civilians nationwide, many accused of being members of the paramilitary or army sympathizers. Guerrillas continue to kidnap for ransom, seizing 701 people in 2000 alone. Some victims are elderly. Some are in diapers. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, among those held hostage by the FARC in 2000 were Andres Felipe Navas Suarez, 3, and Clara Olivia Pantoja, 5, both seized from their parents in Bogota and taken to the zone until their families paid a ransom for their release. In June and July, FARC made headlines by releasing 350 police and soldiers, some it had held for more than three years. Although this was a positive step, the release also underscored the desperate conditions in which these men had been kept -- without adequate shelter, medical care or clean water. In a few cases, international pressure has led FARC to acknowledge responsibility for certain gross violations and to announce that it will sanction the perpetrators. For example, during our visit to the zone, FARC commanders told Human Rights Watch that the two FARC combatants who killed American civilians Terence Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay and Ingrid Washinawatok on March 5, 1999, had been found """"guilty."""" The FARC sentenced the two killers to dig 55 yards of trenches and clear land, an absurd punishment for so grave a crime. In October, Pastrana will decide whether to renew the zone, which he may do to further peace negotiations. Before he does, it is imperative that effective measures be taken to ensure the protection of the zone's residents. For its part, FARC should make a public commitment to permit a system of independent national and international monitoring within the zone and to respect basic humanitarian law standards. Colombia remains the recipient of several hundred million dollars in U.S. aid, a significant portion of which will fund a military that has ties to paramilitary organizations. The international community rightly continues to focus on paramilitary violations. But the grave abuses committed by the guerrillas deserve no less attention.","Americas, Colombia",""

Black farm residents are most severely affected by this failure, and black women are most vulnerable of all, Human Rights Watch said. The 230-page report, Unequal Protection: The State Response to Violent Crime on South African Farms, is being published in advance of next week’s United Nations conference on racism, to be held in Durban. It is based on research carried out by Human Rights Watch in rural areas of South Africa during 2000. The state response to violent crime against white farm owners and managers could and should be improved, Human Rights Watch said, but black farm workers and their families have much more difficulty getting help from the criminal justice system.  “Attacks against farm owners have gotten most of the attention, but attacks against other farm residents are a much bigger problem,” said Bronwen Manby, deputy director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch and the main author of the report. “Farmworkers and other rural dwellers are more vulnerable to violence, including from their employers, and less likely to get help from the police and courts.”  In South Africa, where land ownership was restricted to whites for most of the twentieth century, most farm owners are still white, whereas farmworkers are mostly black. Since the early 1990s, there has been a marked increase in assaults and murders of the owners and managers of commercial farms and their families.  In response to calls from commercial farmers’ organizations for action against violent crime, the South African government has implemented a “rural protection plan” in commercial farming areas. Many farm owners do not believe the plan has been effective. But representatives of the state security forces still tend to give greater priority to crimes committed against farm owners than against their employees. This is the case even when the crimes committed are of equal seriousness. Women subjected to sexual violence are least likely of all to obtain a satisfactory response from the system.  In some areas, the heightened security measures of the rural protection plan have even increased insecurity for black farm residents, who are targeted for beatings and other harassment by over-zealous security agents. Private security companies hired by farm owners have also committed serious abuses.  The Human Rights Watch report highlighted abuses committed by regular and reserve members of the army and police and by private security companies in the Wakkerstroom area of Mpumalanga and the Ixopo area of KwaZulu-Natal.  Members of the Wakkerstroom commando, a reserve army unit, for example, are accused of carrying out assault, torture, forced and illegal evictions, and murder of farm residents. Many farmworkers and residents — it is impossible to say how many — are also subjected to physical abuse by their employers and their agents. This abuse can range from casual blows with fists for alleged mistakes in work or impertinence, to serious physical violence, including rape and murder.  “The rural protection plan needs a complete rethink,” said Manby. “Unless it becomes a broader response to the security concerns of all those living in commercial farming areas, it will continue to fail even those white farm owners who have caused it to be created.”  Human Rights Watch called on the South African government to implement a range of measures to ensure that it lived up to its obligations under international law to provide equal protection to all its citizens, black and white, men and women. In particular, it urged that:  The government must ensure that the criminal justice system responds effectively and promptly to any reported serious crime, without discrimination; Only police should carry out policing duties, and not members of the army; Both police and army should ensure proper disciplinary or prosecutorial action against those responsible for abuses; and  Private security initiatives, whether voluntary “farmwatch” groups or private security companies, should be brought under more effective control.","Africa, South Africa","Women's Rights, Domestic Workers"

When I got to him I crossed the river to the fence separating us. The farmer was standing on the steeper side. He had a big stone in his hand, and he put it on top of a big pole and asked me to cross to his side of the fence and asked me where I was going. I said I was going to my neighbor and he then said ‘when are you going to leave the farm.’ And I said I would not leave because the previous farm owner said we should stay on the farm. He then crossed the fence to my side and grabbed me and started assaulting me. He was hitting me until I fell to the ground and then he pressed me to the ground and started banging my head against the ground and strangling me. Then he tried to pull me to the river down the steep bank, saying ‘today I am going to kill you.’ I was sure I was going to die anyway so I pulled at his balls and started screaming; he let go and I could run away.... I ran to my neighbors bleeding and told them he had assaulted me. The following day I went to the police station and reported the case. They took a statement and came back with police officers to the farm. When we got there the farmer said he had never seen me. The police wanted him to come to the police station, and he said ‘no, I am busy with my accounts.’ Some of the other workers had heard me screaming, but when I later went to the police station to see what had happened with the case, the investigating officer said the farmer had come to cancel the case with several workers from the farm who were witnesses for him saying they had heard nothing.  An elderly white woman living on a smallholding near Johannesburg described the second burglary at her premises in 1997:  One night I suddenly woke up and heard a smash. I jumped out of bed and got on the radio alarm and called Pieter [a neighbor]. I got dressed in no time and took my Beretta that I had next to my bed—before, I used to keep it in a safe—and stood next to the wall. They must have had a crow bar because they had lifted up the steel door, and then must have woken me smashing the wooden door, then they’d climbed on the deep freeze to break the window and get in. They were in the kitchen, and I heard one say ‘baas, mos ek nou skiet?’ [master, must I shoot now?].... Then I fired a shot. Then there was no sound, they were bundled together in the kitchen. I thought to myself, I have three more cartridges, but then I heard Pieter’s gun firing outside... he shot their sentry. Pieter called me and I came outside. They had run away.... The police only came the next day.... they took fingerprints, but I found the cartridges they had used.

On August 13, 2001 -- the same day the Macedonian government and ethnic Albanian leaders signed a framework peace agreement -- police officers in Skopje beat to death an Albanian man suspected of being a rebel. """"Persistent police abuse in Macedonia is simply shocking,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Macedonia must urgently address the violence in its police stations. Ethnic Albanians are being severely abused, and in some cases beaten to death, without the slightest prospect of accountability.""""  Human Rights Watch also urged that international organizations operating in Macedonia dramatically increase their human rights monitoring presence in the country.  On Monday, August 13, 2001, police officers guarding Skopje's main hospital arrested four ethnic Albanians who had come to the hospital to pick up an elderly Albanian relative undergoing kidney dialysis treatment. The police searched their car and claimed to find a bullet in the trunk. The police then proceeded to beat the four men in the street.  The men were then taken onto the hospital grounds and beaten continuously for several hours with heavy metal cables, baseball bats, police truncheons, and gun butts, amidst jeering from the civilian crowd that had gathered. Following this, the four men were taken to the """"Beko One"""" police station, where they were subjected to more beatings, had urine and burning cigarettes thrown at them, and were threatened with execution. Following interventions from their ethnic Macedonian lawyer and a police officer who knew the men, they were released the next morning. One of the men, twenty-nine year old Nazmi Aliu, father of a six-year-old and a two-year-old, died that day at the hospital from the injuries he received from the police beatings.  Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed two of the surviving men, who gave consistent and credible accounts of their ordeal, and inspected their severe bruises from the beatings. One of the men, who was a week later still unable to stand because of the injuries he received during the beatings, told Human Rights Watch:  [After claiming to find the bullet], they started beating us right there. One police officer hit me with a thick wire cable and slammed my head into the wall. My front teeth were in great pain. They were beating us for about one hour in the street, all of them, with cables, rubber truncheons, baseball bats, gun handles. There were lots of civilians there looking, they were swearing at us. We couldn't walk, so they dragged us inside the main gate [of the hospital] to some stores near a fountain. While they were dragging us, they were beating us very badly. I lost my consciousness there from the beating, and they took water from the fountain to revive us. . . .  Then they dragged us out and put us in a police van and took us to the police station. They dragged us out of the van, and the commander said, """"Who wishes to beat the UCK [rebels]?"""" They formed a column of police officers, some on our left and some on our right, and one of the officers would drag us through the column and they would beat us . . . .  [In the cell,] the commander came and opened the door and everyone came inside. They beat us very badly, I couldn't move to protect myself, we were just lying like dead bodies there. Then the commander said, """"OK, it's enough now, we will do it again after five minutes."""" He locked the door. . . . One police officer grabbed a long metal stick and started beating us through the bars. We couldn't move, we just lay there and couldn't protect ourselves. They took a basket of water and urinated in it, and threw it on us. They kept pouring water on us, just to keep us conscious. They would swear at us, saying, """"You UCK motherfuckers, we are going to kill you slowly."""" Police abuse is an endemic problem in Macedonia, and was one of the main grievances raised by the ethnic Albanian rebel National Liberation Army (NLA; UCK in Albanian)) to justify its resort to arms. The framework peace agreement signed last week provides for the gradual integration of ethnic Albanians into the predominantly ethnic Macedonian police force.  """"The peace agreement lays out a long-term plan for addressing the problem,"""" Andersen stated. """"What is also needed are immediate measures to curb abuse, including international human rights monitors regularly visiting police stations and insisting on accountability in cases like these.""""  Human Rights Watch has issued two reports on police abuse in Macedonia, in 1996 and in 1998. (See A Threat to Stability, June 1996; and Police Violence in Macedonia, April 1998) The rights group has documented widespread abuse at police stations since the beginning of the conflict. (See Human Rights Watch release, Macedonian Police Abuses Documented, May 31, 2001).  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the safety of at least twenty-seven ethnic Albanian men who were detained on Sunday, August 12, 2001 by the Macedonian police during an operation in the village of Ljuboten. In addition to the detentions, the Ljuboten operation resulted in the deaths of at least ten ethnic Albanian civilians. The Macedonian police have claimed that the operation targeted an NLA stronghold, but they have produced no proof to counteract mounting evidence that the victims of the police action were civilians, not fighters.  On Saturday, August 18, relatives found the body of one man missing from Ljuboten, thirty-five-year-old Atulah Qaini, at the morgue in Skopje. The body of Qaini, who had last been seen in police custody in the village, bore clear signs of severe beatings and had a cracked skull when inspected by Human Rights Watch researchers. Most of the other men have been located alive in police detention, but bear clear signs of severe beatings according to relatives. A mother interviewed by Human Rights Watch who had a thirteen- year-old son detained in the village said that his entire face was bruised and swollen when she went to visit him in prison.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

MEXICO  Dear President Fox: I am writing to express our strong support for the establishment of a truth commission to investigate past human rights violations in Mexico. We have been greatly encouraged by statements you have made over the last year recognizing the need for such a commission. We trust that under your leadership a commission will be created with the authority, resources, and legal powers necessary to succeed in its tasks. The establishment of a truth commission offers an opportunity for your government to clarify the many cases that have never been adequately investigated and prosecuted by judicial authorities, such as the massacres of Tlatelolco in 1968 and Acteal in 1997 . Not only the victims and their families, but Mexican society as a whole, stand to benefit from having these cases properly resolved.  We understand that the proposed truth commission has its critics-even within your administration-who fear that it might undermine the institutions already charged with administering justice in Mexico. Faced with a choice between truth and justice, these critics argue, Mexicans should choose justice. Put this way, who could possibly be against the criminal prosecution of those responsible for egregious human rights abuses? But this is in fact a false choice. Mexicans have the right to truth and justice. And, under international law, your government has an obligation to provide both.  The international treaties ratified by Mexico, such as the American Convention on Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, require states parties to prevent human rights violations and to sanction those who commit them. This duty reflects the view that ending impunity for past abuses is crucial for preventing future ones. It also derives from the right of victims to see their abusers brought to justice. A first step in this process is the systematic investigation and clarification of past abuses. Seeking the truth about abuses that occurred under past governments is not a matter of political vengeance or witch hunting. It is a fundamental obligation binding on your government, regardless of who was in power at the time the abuses were committed. History has shown that truth commissions do not undermine existing judicial mechanisms, but rather they strengthen them. In Argentina, Chile, and Guatemala, for example, truth commissions have played a crucial role in improving the judiciary's capacity to handle human rights cases. Not only have they presented new evidence necessary for prosecutions, they have also helped these societies to understand and to address the failings of the judicial institutions that allowed these crimes to go unpunished. The Chilean and Argentine commissions dedicated whole chapters of their final reports to explaining how their judicial systems had failed to handle abuse cases. To ensure that these lessons are acted upon, truth commission reports typically include comprehensive recommendations on how to reform and strengthen weak or ineffective state institutions. The value of truth commissions as a spur to judicial efforts is especially obvious when legal institutions have failed to administer justice fairly and adequately in the past. This, unfortunately, has been the case in Mexico. It should be emphasized, of course, that any truth commission that is established must be appropriately constituted, adequately funded, and equipped with the necessary legal powers. It must be an independent, non-political body, made up of knowledgeable and distinguished members. It must also be allocated the resources necessary to conduct thorough and fair investigations. It must, finally, be granted the legal authority to obtain documents and cooperation from other government institutions. Anything short of this will lack the credibility needed to carry out its tasks effectively.  When you took office last December, you inherited a state in which impunity had flourished for decades. Understanding the high cost of this pernicious tradition, which sanctioned injustice and perpetuated inequality, you promised that you would take steps to clarify and resolve past abuses. We strongly support your efforts in this regard, and believe that it is now time to put your plans into effect.

Civil society leaders are set to play an important part in the inter-Congolese dialogue meant to bring peace to the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). As preparatory discussions for the dialogue opened yesterday in Gaborone, Human Rights Watch denounced the rebel authorities for having detained, beaten, and threatened leaders of civil society. RCD-Goma also initially delayed, but later authorized the departure of Gervais Chirhalirwa, leader of a coalition of civil society groups in Bukavu, who was to attend the meeting. """"Just as the international community is inviting Congolese leaders of civil society to say what they think is needed for peace, the RCD is trying to shut them up,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor for the Great Lakes region with the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch.  On August 9 agents of the RCD Department of Security and Intelligence abducted Pastor Claude Olenga, head of the Justice and Peace Commission of the Archdiocese of Kisangani, and took him to their office where they forced him to disrobe and beat him severely. They interrogated him about the content of radio and television programs that he had broadcast on Amani, a station owned by the Catholic Church, and about contacts with other activists and the Archbishop of Kisangani. When released later that day, Olenga was ordered to keep silent about his ordeal.  Congolese activists have campaigned for the demilitarization of Kisangani, the second largest Congolese city. RCD troops have thus far refused to quit the city as called for by the U.N. Security Council, delaying the arrival there of U.N. peacekeeping forces known as MONUC. Kisangani may serve as the site for the inter-Congolese dialogue. In 2000, Rwanda, which backs the RCD, and Uganda fought for the control of Kisangani, killing hundreds of civilians and causing great property damage. Kisangani activists are demanding that the two governments pay reparations, as urged also by the U.N. Security Council.  Activists have also delivered information about human rights abuses by the RCD to visiting foreign dignitaries, including the U.N. Special Rapporteur for the DRC and the Belgian Prime Minister. In addition, they have called repeatedly for an international court to prosecute war crimes committed in the DRC war.  To silence and isolate critical activists, local RCD authorities denounced them on the radio and in public rallies as informants and agents of hostile foreigners. They also prohibited activists from traveling and sent soldiers to intimidate them with nightly visits to their homes. Among those so harassed were Dismas Kitenge, chairman of the Lotus Group, Jean-Pierre Badideke of Justice and Liberation, Firmin Yangambi Libote, head of Peace on Earth, Floribert Ngongo, a journalist active with Lotus, and Abisa Bokanga, coordinator of a civil society coalition.  RCD authorities in Uvira, South Kivu, have also detained, beaten, and threatened local leaders whom they charge with supporting the Mai-Mai, a local militia fighting to expel foreigners from the Congo. When opponents of the RCD disrupted a rally meant to celebrate the third anniversary of the start of the rebellion on August 2, local authorities detained scores of alleged Mai-Mai accomplices, among them staff of Elimu and the Action Committee for Integrated Development, local civil society groups. At least two of the detainees were beaten, one so severely as to require hospitalization. Prominent activists were soon released, but others remain detained in harsh conditions.  """"If the inter-Congolese dialogue is going to work,"""" said Des Forges, """"activists--like leaders of the political opposition--must be free to talk to each other, to express their ideas publicly, and to travel from place to place. RCD-Goma must guarantee these basic rights, even to those who hold opinions different from their own."""" Human Rights Watch called on the RCD-Goma to put an immediate end to the harassment and threats of civil society and rights activists, and in particular to immediately release those still detained for no reason other than their opinion and activities they undertook in fulfillment of the mandate of their organizations. The RCD-Goma should investigate all reports of torture and ill-treatment of detainees and hold those responsible accountable.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo",""

Human Rights Watch also called for the government to allow local human rights organizations to carry out fact-finding investigations without intimidation and to cease persecution of non-violent supporters of political change. """"There is no question that both sides have been responsible for unlawful killings, as well as a wide range of other abuses,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"But the Indonesian government has a particular responsibility to ensure that those who are supposed to uphold the law do not themselves become violators of it. In this, it has failed utterly.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the new government of President Megawati Soekarnoputri to move quickly to set up human rights courts to prosecute cases of serious human rights violations.  """"The President also needs to give her full support to independent investigations into some of the most serious killings in Aceh,"""" said Jones. Such incidents, she said, include the murder of three humanitarian workers outside Lhokseumawe on December 6, 2000; the murder of human rights defender Suprin Sulaiman and two others after leaving a police station in South Aceh in late March; the massacres in Central Aceh last June, in which both sides have been implicated; and the killing of more than thirty civilian plantation workers in East Aceh on August 9.  The new forty page report, The War in Aceh, documents the difficulty that local human rights organizations have had in doing field investigations over the last six months, and Jones said the obstacles to such work seemed to be on the rise. """"Rights monitors are squeezed by both sides,"""" she said. """"If they report on military or police abuses, they face criminal defamation charges. If they report on rebel abuses, they get warnings and threats.""""  Jones noted that as military operations in Aceh intensified in June and July 2001, government pressure on activist organizations intensified, leading to frequent raids, seizures of computers and documents, and in some cases, arrests.  """"We're particularly concerned that the government seems to be making increased use of the laws Soeharto used to use against his critics,"""" said Jones, referring to Indonesia's former president. """"Freedom of expression is again under attack, especially in relation to public support for a political referendum in Aceh.""""  The new report notes that the Acehnese rebel organization, Gerakan Aceh Merdeka (GAM, the Free Aceh Movement) has tried to restrict free expression by threatening journalists who do not report GAM's version of events. It also looks at killings and unlawful detentions by GAM, as well as GAM's forced expulsions of ethnic Javanese.  The report also examines the Indonesian security forces' role in extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" torture, and collective punishment.  The report examines one particular case that has had a major impact in Aceh in terms of assistance to victims, redress for abuses, and political space for work by local human rights organizations. The case involves five women from the district of South Aceh reported in February 2001 to have been sexually abused by members of the paramilitary police, known as Brimob. Human rights nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) brought the women to Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, where the case was widely publicized. The women were later taken into police custody whereupon they changed their stories, saying it was GAM who had abducted them and forced them to say that they had been assaulted by Brimob.  One of those summoned as a suspect was a respected religious leader named Teungku Kamal. On March 29, 2001, after giving a deposition to the South Aceh police, he was shot and killed, together with his lawyer, a human rights advocate named Suprin Sulaiman, and their driver. By early August 2001, Indonesian authorities had not mounted any serious investigation into these killings. They were, however, aggressively pursuing the defamation case against the NGOs.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Last week the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom released its list of recommendations to the Bush administration for countries of particular concern; it did not include Uzbekistan. The administration is slated to make its decision in early September.  On the same day the commission issued its decision, nine men were sentenced by a Tashkent court to prison terms ranging from 8 to 16 years for membership in an unregistered Muslim group. At least 43 people are currently on trial in Tashkent for similar offenses.  """"These people were singled out for nothing more than the peaceful expression of their religious beliefs,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"If the Bush administration doesn't name Uzbekistan, it signals to the government and other countries in the region that the U.S. is willing to tolerate this kind of persecution.""""  Under the 1998 International Religious Freedom Act, countries whose governments engage in serious violations of religious freedom can be named countries of particular concern for religious freedom. The law offers the president a menu of options for dealing with such countries, ranging from limiting certain kinds of assistance to full sanctions.  The Human Rights Watch memorandum is based on more than 800 individual cases of religious persecution documented by the group since 1999. In the overwhelming majority of cases, victims were singled out for their nonviolent religious practices or affiliations: they prayed in mosques not run by the government, belonged to Islamic groups not registered with the government, possessed or distributed Islamic literature not generated by the government, were affiliated with disgraced imams, or met privately for prayer or Islamic study. Sentences for such crimes range from 15 to 20 years in prison. The memorandum also includes a list of independent Muslims who died in custody in the past three years, apparently due to torture.  Among those convicted in the past 12 months was Imam Abduvohid Yuldashev, who was tortured during five months of incommunicado detention and then sentenced to 19 years in prison, primarily on the allegation that lessons he gave on the Koran and other Islamic texts while serving as a state-appointed imam were actually lessons in """"fundamentalism."""" Authorities earlier subjected the imam's wife to a series of hate rallies, reminiscent of the Stalin era, publicly denouncing her as an """"enemy of the people."""" They threatened to arrest her if she did not remove her headscarf, a symbol of her piety.  In recent months, the authorities have begun to arrest women. In March 2001 police arrested Rahima Akhmedalieva, the wife of an imam who had fled the country fearing arrest. They kept her, a mother of three, in custody in the basement of Tashkent police headquarters, and have refused to release her until her husband surrenders to police. Five months later, she remains a hostage in police custody.  """"The commission's failure to recommend Uzbekistan is utterly incomprehensible,"""" said Andersen. The commission's recommendations for countries of particular concern included Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Burma, China, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Laos, and Saudi Arabia.  In previous years the U.S. administration for the most part designated as countries of particular concern those that already fell under U.S sanctions, leading many to view the list as serving political purposes rather than the promotion of religious freedom.

Argentina used the same argument last year to reject extradition requests forwarded by Spanish judge Baltazar Garzon.  Human Rights Watch disputed the government's reasoning. """"Despite what the government says, the extradition request does not involve any conflict of jurisdiction,"""" Vivanco said. """"Astiz is protected by an amnesty law from prosecution in Argentina for the crimes of which he is accused. Many years have gone by since military rule, but the Argentine courts have never tried him.""""  Astiz is sought in Italy because of his role in the kidnapping of Angela María Aieta, Giovani Pegoraro, and Pegoraro's daughter Susana. Angela María Aieta was abducted from her home on August 5, 1976, and was held at the Navy Mechanics School (ESMA), a secret detention center where Astiz worked. A survivor of the ESMA camp has testified that she saw Aieta being taken away, possibly for execution. Giovani and Susana Pegoraro were kidnapped in a railway station on June 18, 1977, when Susana was five months pregnant. None of the three were ever heard of again, but Susana's daughter was later traced and found to be living with a military couple to whom she was handed over after her birth in detention.  Astiz also participated as an undercover agent in the """"disappearance"""" in 1977 of two French nuns, Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet. In 1990 a French court sentenced Astiz in absentia to life imprisonment for this crime.  An estimated 15,000 people """"disappeared"""" during Argentina's military government (1976-1983). The crimes for which both the Italian and French governments are seeking Astiz's extradition are covered by Argentina's 1987 """"due obedience"""" law, which provides immunity from prosecution to all military officers except those in positions of command at the time. Because of this law, charges against Astiz in the case of the two French nuns were dropped in June 1987.  Although Astiz has escaped punishment in Argentina since the end of military rule, there are still two ways in which the Argentine courts could potentially try him. If a judge was willing to declare the due obedience law null and void, Astiz could be charged with the """"disappearance"""" of the Pergoraro family. One judge made such a ruling in March 2001, but Argentina's higher courts have not yet ruled on the propriety of this landmark decision, which is being appealed by the defendants in that case.  Alternatively, Astiz could be charged for the theft of Susana Pegoraro's daughter and her transfer to a military family, a type of crime that is not covered by the due obedience law. So far, the judge investigating this case has questioned Astiz, but has not filed charges. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson said yesterday that the government had sent details of the Italian extradition request to the court asking it to investigate Astiz's responsibility for this crime.","Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Argentina, France, Italy","International Justice"

Bush due to visit Shanghai and Beijing in just 10 weeks, his administration badly needs a human-rights policy for China. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell went to Beijing to lay the groundwork for Mr. Bush's visit and returned claiming his talks were """"very productive."""" China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs chimed in, gushing about a """"significant momentum"""" in Sino-U.S. relations. But diplomatic spin isn't the same as having a clear policy to promote human rights. The White House knew it had to resolve the high-profile cases of Chinese-born scholars with American ties detained in China. It also had to tone down the rhetoric that portrayed China more as an emerging enemy than an emerging market. Mr. Powell has done both. But now the White House needs a strategy to move beyond the damage control. It should creatively use Mr. Bush's participation at the October 20-21 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Shanghai, and state visit in Beijing, to achieve measurable momentum on human rights. China's nervous leadership has a great deal at stake in pulling off a productive Bush visit. President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji need to stabilize relations with their biggest and most important trading partner so they can focus their attentions on the leadership succession and other pressing issues at home. With his trip coming at such a time, Mr. Bush has some leverage -- and he should use it. The new U.S. ambassador to China, Clark Randt, should press for the release of scholars still detained, including U.S. citizen Wu Jianmin, who has just been formally arrested, Xu Zerong, an academic formerly based in Hong Kong, and Qu Wei, a Chinese citizen handed a 13-year prison sentence for allegedly giving """"secrets"""" to Gao Zhan and Li Shaomin, the two scholars recently expelled from China. The Chinese government should be told that without these releases there is no way Mr. Bush's state visit can go smoothly; there will be no toothy smiles of the kind broadcast during Mr. Powell's trip to Beijing. The administration also needs a policy to deal with the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region in China's far northwest, a resource-rich area populated by the Muslim, Turkic-speaking Uighurs. Xinjiang is targeted for energy development and Premier Zhu is spearheading a drive to entice foreign companies and the World Bank to invest, hoping development will also dampen Uighur demands for autonomy or independence. Mr. Zhu went to Xinjiang last year and called for an """"iron fist"""" to crush suspected separatists there. Prior to President Bush's visit, the White House should negotiate an agreement giving United Nations human-rights monitors, the foreign media and diplomats unhindered access to both Xinjiang and Tibet, where repression accompanies development. During his trip to China, Mr. Powell avoided mentioning individual cases and focused instead on """"the whole issue of human rights and the rule of law."""" Now he should back that up by placing back on the table the issue of re-education through labor by which Chinese can be sentenced up to three years in prison without trial. The U.N. has urged an official review leading to the abolition of this practice of administrative detention. But there's been no progress beyond discussions in legal-academic circles. Pushing for the reform of such extra-judicial abuse is one way to push China to modernize its legal system as it prepares to join the World Trade Organization. One issue where trade and human rights overlap is the emergence of the Internet in China, where more than 60 sets of draconian regulations have been imposed by the government to control its use. They censor foreign news and mandate strict supervision of chat rooms and electronic bulletin boards to prevent dissemination of information that allegedly """"jeopardizes national security, reveals state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity."""" A 40,000-strong force of Internet police has inspected Internet cafes, shutting down thousands, because of the downloading of various kinds of objectionable material. President Bush should consider visiting an Internet cafe in Beijing or Shanghai. But first he should figure out what the U.S. and other APEC-member nations can do to pressure China to ease restrictions on the Internet. The goal should be to enhance the flow of commercial information and widen channels for free expression used by Chinese citizens. U.S. corporate sponsors of the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing should also be asked to help. Mr. Powell may have set the tone for better U.S.-China relations, and Mr. Bush's phone call to Mr. Jiang on July 5 may have helped break the logjam impeding release of the U.S. scholars. But it's too soon to tell whether these are first steps toward a serious China human-rights policy, or mere tactical political maneuvers. Former President Bill Clinton was often accused of having a reactive, crisis-driven approach to China. The Bush administration has yet to show it can do any better.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/13/bush-should-press-china-human-rights","Bush Should Press China on Human Rights","Bush Should Press China on Human Rights","","08/13/2001","WASHINGTON - President Clinton was criticized for his inconsistent and erratic China policy, especially on human rights. But as President Bush prepares to make his first official visit to China this fall, it's not yet clear that his policy will be any better. Secretary of State Colin Powell returned from a quick trip to Beijing in late July glowing about an upturn in U.S.-China relations. His visit was intended to pave the way for Mr. Bush going to Shanghai Oct. 20 for the Asian Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, then to Beijing for a state visit.  Just before Mr. Powell's arrival, the authorities staged sham espionage trials for two U.S.-linked China scholars, Gao Zhan from American University in Washington and Li Shoamin, a U.S. citizen teaching business courses in Hong Kong.  The two were expelled, and Mr. Powell welcomed their release - only to find that his own interview on official Chinese TV had been censored to delete his remarks on human rights. The State Department thought it had a deal that nothing would be cut and protested the omission. But the damage had been done.  That's the problem with the Bush policy on China thus far: It has focused on damage control rather than a coherent strategy to encourage change. Mr. Powell was right to drop the administration's earlier rhetoric demonizing China. But now the White House must move to use the leverage of the forthcoming summit. The new U.S. ambassador in Beijing, Clark Randt, should make it clear that without significant steps forward on human rights, Mr. Bush's first encounter with President Jiang Zemin cannot go smoothly.  The Chinese leadership is engaged in an ongoing succession struggle; a Communist Party Congress late in 2002 will choose Mr. Jiang's successor, a new premier and other top officials. And the party expects that China's entry into the World Trade Organization will trigger even greater rural and urban unrest. In this climate, Mr. Bush's visit has enormous symbolic and practical importance, cementing relations with China's largest trading and investment partner.  Before the summit, the administration should press for the release of the scholars still detained. They are Wu Jianmin, a U.S. citizen formally arrested for spying; Xu Zerong, an academic previously based in Hong Kong; and Qu Wei, a Chinese citizen given a 13-year prison sentence for giving """"secrets"""" to the two scholars expelled from China last month.  With the Chinese leadership making a big push to entice foreign energy companies to invest in Xinjiang, the far northwestern province, the administration urgently needs to develop a strategy, along with the European Union and Japan, to press for greater outside scrutiny of developments in the region.  Xinjiang is a huge Uighur ethnic minority region where Beijing is fiercely suppressing any support for autonomy or independence. A nationwide anti-crime campaign called """"Strike Hard,"""" launched in April, is targeted at suspected separatists in Xinjiang, resulting in arbitrary arrests and summary executions.  The White House should begin talks now to negotiate an agreement allowing foreign journalists, diplomats and U.N. human-rights monitors unrestricted access to Xinjiang, as well as to Tibet. Such an agreement would be a real breakthrough that could be announced in connection with Mr. Bush's visit.  A key issue linking human rights and trade is the growth of the Internet in China. But the government's controls on Internet access are having a chilling effect on academic freedom, commercial exchanges and free expression. More than 60 sets of draconian regulations have been adopted requiring censorship of foreign news sites, imposing restrictions on chat rooms and bulletin boards and giving the authorities discretion to punish virtually any form of expression.  For example, """"topics that damage the reputation of the state"""" are banned, but an Internet user has no way of knowing what those topics might be. Several people have been imprisoned for downloading or posting politically sensitive material on the Web, and the police have shut down thousands of Internet cafés.  Mr. Bush should plan to visit an Internet café in Beijing or Shanghai and make public his concern about censored Web sites. In addition, he should work with other APEC-member countries to push China to ease restrictions on the Internet. American businesses sponsoring the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing should be asked by the White House to assist in this effort.  The Bush administration must address a wide range of concerns in dealing with China, but human rights must be a key issue on the agenda. And the forthcoming summit should yield results, not just rhetoric. Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington Director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

Beazley is scheduled to be executed on Wednesday unless the state parole board recommends clemency and Gov. Rick Perry grants it. """"The death penalty is not an appropriate sentence for a crime committed as a child,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Children don't have an adult's maturity or restraint."""" If his death sentence is carried out, Beazley will become the eighteenth juvenile offender to be executed nationwide and the tenth in Texas since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Twenty-three U.S. states allow the death penalty to be imposed on juvenile offenders, but only fifteen states actually have juvenile offenders on their death rows. Texas has nearly a third of the eighty-four juvenile offenders sentenced to death nationwide. Nationally, the number of people sentenced to death for crimes committed as children has fallen in recent years. In 1994, seventeen juvenile offenders were sentenced to death. Eleven received death sentences in 1998. Nine were given sentences of death in 1999, and last year capital punishment was imposed on six persons for crimes they were found to have committed as children. Support for the juvenile death penalty may be waning even in Texas. In Harris County-which hands down more death sentences than any other county in the state-only 25 percent of residents supported the death penalty for juvenile offenders, even though 62 percent continue to support the death penalty overall, a February Houston Chronicle poll found. Elsewhere in the world, only Congo and Iran are known to have executed juvenile offenders in the last three years.

The abductions were part of an increasing pattern of illegal detentions and kidnappings by ethnic Albanian fighters who call themselves the National Liberation Army (NLA). Human Rights Watch reported that it has separately received information about the recent abduction by NLA fighters of at least fourteen Macedonian civilians from the city of Tetovo alone.  """"Abductions and illegal detentions by the NLA are rapidly rising."""" said Elizabeth Andersen, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The NLA has failed to account for at least fourteen Macedonians abducted from Tetovo during the fighting in late July.""""  Three of the road workers were working near the village of Grupcin on the main Skopje-Tetovo road at about 8 a.m. on Tuesday, August 7, 2001, when they were abducted by uniformed members of the NLA, who came from the woods nearby. The NLA fighters ordered them to walk to a nearby camp, and then brutally abused them. At about noon the same day, the ethnic Albanian rebels abducted two more workers from the same area, and subjected them to similar abuse. Previous incidents in the area suggest that the NLA mistreatment of the road crew was intended to stop the road crew from working on the road.  Human Rights Watch interviewed two of the five workers separately, and found their detailed accounts credible and consistent. The two men showed Human Rights Watch their severe wounds, which were consistent with their accounts.  The abuse started with a severe beating. Then one of the rebels used a knife to carve letters on the Macedonians' backs and to cut them on other parts of their bodies. One of the rebels forced the men to perform oral sex on each other, and tried to anally rape one of the men with a wooden stick. The men were then beaten more before they were driven to a nearby village and released shortly after 7 p.m. Tuesday.  One of the men interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated:  One of [the NLA rebels] took a spade and started beating us with the metal part. We were sitting on the ground then. He said to put our palms on our knees, and he started beating us with the spade, trying to hit us in the head. We raised our hands to protect our heads, and everytime we put our hands up, he would beat us on our legs and arms. . . . Then he left, he was probably called away and this other guy came. There were two others, they were standing by our sides with machine guns since the beginning. The one who came was a bit thin. He had very short hair, and was going a bit bald . . . . He told us to take off our T-shirts. He pulled out a knife, it was a folding knife. Then he asked everyone for their names. He started carving in my back, I didn't know what he was writing, but it was for about five minutes. It was painful, but I couldn't move. I just firmed my body to take the pain. After the cutting, the NLA fighter ordered the men to lie down, and ordered one of the men to anally rape one of the others with a stick, before grabbing the stick and attempting to rape the man himself with the stick. He then forced the men to perform oral sex on each other. The men were then kept for several hours in pits where they were regularly beaten by the NLA fighters. Before being released, one of the NLA fighters took his pistol, cocked it, and shoved it in the mouth of one of the abducted men, threatening to kill him if he told about the abuse.  Human Rights Watch has confirmed that at least fourteen ethnic Macedonian men were abducted by NLA fighters from the town of Tetovo during heavy fighting in the end of July, and expressed deep concern about the fate of the men.  Human Rights Watch raised the cases of the missing ethnic Macedonians with a regional NLA commander for the Tetovo region, who uses the code name Matoshi, and the commander stated that he had no information about the cases. According to their families, the ethnic Macedonian men were last seen in the custody of NLA fighters. Human Rights Watch is still investigating other reports it has received of abducted Macedonians in NLA-controlled areas in recent days.  """"We are deeply concerned about the safety of ethnic Macedonians abducted by the Albanian rebels in recent weeks,"""" said Andersen. """"These men should be released now, the NLA must bring those responsible for these serious abuses to account, and take steps to ensure that such crimes cease.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

Your ratification, as President of the Palestinian Authority, is required before these four men can be brought before the firing squad. Human Rights Watch urges you in the strongest terms to commute these executions.  We also urge you to condemn in clear and unequivocal terms vigilante-type killings of alleged collaborators, and to order the authorities to bring to justice those responsible for such killings. Two Palestinians were reportedly shot dead on Wednesday night, August 1, and another seriously wounded. Another suspected collaborator was killed on Tuesday, July 31. According to press reports, militia leaders associated with Fatah have claimed credit for some of these killings and have threatened to carry out further killings.  The sentencing in the Thabit case, which followed earlier sessions on July 28 and 30, reportedly lasted ten minutes. It was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was moved earlier following an Israeli helicopter gunship attack on a Nablus office that killed eight persons, including two political leaders of Hamas, two journalists, and two children, and wounded fifteen. Nablus governor Mahmud Aloul told the media that it was rescheduled so that the verdict could be publicized prior to the funerals of the eight on Wednesday.  Another defendant in the Thabit case, 17-year-old Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, was spared the death penalty as a minor and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. A fifth defendant, Husan Afif Khalil, was released as mentally unfit. The Attorney General for State Security Courts, Khaled al-Qidra, had told Reuters news agency on July 9 that the Palestinian Authority would seek the death penalty for three of those accused in connection with the Thabit killing.  Human Rights Watch has condemned the Israeli policy of """"liquidations"""" and the killing of Thabit Thabit, and has called for the investigation and prosecution of all persons responsible for attacks on civilians. Human Rights Watch opposes the use of the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life, both because of its inherent cruelty, and because of the possibility that individuals wrongly convicted may be executed. We are further disturbed by the Palestinian Authority's recourse to the death penalty following trials before state security and military courts, trials which do not comport with basic international fair trial standards and whose verdicts may have been influenced by political considerations.  On January 13, after a twenty-two month moratorium on executions, Allam Bani Ouda was publicly executed in Nablus and Majdi Mikkawi was executed in Gaza. Both were convicted in State Security Courts of collaboration with the Israeli secret services following summary trials without access to lawyers and the right of appeal, in violation of the most basic fair trial standards. The executions were carried out after you ratified the death sentences.  Also on January 13, Muhammad Dayf Allan al-Khatib and Husam al-Din Musa Hamid were sentenced to death by a Bethlehem Higher State Security Court for collaborating in the killing of Fatah leader Hussain Abeyath, in a trial that lasted five hours and in which only one witness was called. On February 11, Hassan Muhammad Hassan Musallem, a Palestinian security official, was sentenced to death after being convicted by a Hebron military court on charges of collaboration. We request confirmation that these executions have not been, and will not be, carried out.  At a minimum, persons accused of collaboration and treason, as well as all suspects tried before any Palestinian court, should be provided with the following internationally recognized rights:  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty;  to be tried before a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal;  to be informed of the nature and basis of the charges against him or her;  to have adequate time to prepare a defense, to present a defense to the charges, and call witnesses in their defense; to be provided with legal representation, if necessary paid by the state;  to examine the evidence and the witnesses against him or her;  not to be compelled to testify against himself or herself, or to confess guilt; and,  to appeal conviction and sentence to a higher tribunal according to law.  We therefore urge Your Excellency to commute these executions, and to take measures to prevent vigilante killings. It is a matter of deep concern to Human Rights Watch that the Palestinian Authority has reverted to policies that defy the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty by handing down death sentences and carrying out executions. We ask you to ensure the progressive restriction and ultimate elimination of the death penalty in Palestinian law.

It should allow democratic nations to share experiences, to coordinate policies and to reach out to non-governmental actors with similar goals.   First, we believe the Community should be a caucus of nations committed to the universally recognized human rights without which democracy cannot thrive. It should allow democratic nations to share experiences, to coordinate policies and to reach out to non-governmental actors with similar goals. It should offer a forum for those still struggling in repressive societies to solicit support and to tell their stories to the world.   The Community of Democracies should not, however, become a substitute for vigorous engagement in the United Nations and its Commission for Human Rights. Achieving a consensus for democracy and human rights in bodies with universal representation may be hard, but such a consensus is also much harder for dictatorships to dismiss. Indeed, one of the goals of the Community should be to build effective coalitions so that votes for human rights at the U.N. are won, not lost.   Second, we believe the Community can help reinforce international human rights law as a set of standards that all democracies are expected to meet. And by including participants from every part of the world, it can help reaffirm that these standards are truly universal. This year, we hope the Community will be able to welcome new participants, including the newly democratic government of Serbia and the soon-to-be independent democracy of East Timor, to its ranks, so long as they continue their progress.   The Community of Democracies should not be so inclusive, however, that it renders its name meaningless. Many countries around the world wish to be called democracies and wish to be seen as respecting human rights - but on their own terms. Participation in the Community should be limited to those who genuinely seek to uphold its principles.   Last year in Warsaw, the Community adopted a declaration pledging its members to uphold a comprehensive list of """"core democratic principles and practices,"""" including the right to choose governments through free and fair elections, the right to freedom of expression, assembly and the press, the right to be free from arbitrary arrest, detention and torture, as well as all other rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other relevant instruments. No nation fully lives up to the standards set forth in this declaration. Unfortunately, a few of the nations that took part in the Warsaw meeting fell so woefully short that their presence threatened to discredit the initiative.   We hope that you will be more selective in issuing invitations for the conference in Seoul, and offer the following list of countries that merit particular concern. We ask the convening states to use the time between now and Seoul to urge these countries to take specific steps toward genuine democracy and respect for human rights, including those recommended below. If they fail to make progress, they should not be invited to attend.   RUSSIA   The policies of Vladimir Putin's government pose the greatest threat to democratic freedoms in Russia since the breakup of the Soviet Union. Since last year's conference, two of Russia's major independent broadcast media outlets have been brought under quasi-governmental control. Journalists and at least one human rights activist known for their critical reporting have been harassed. Several criminal prosecutions of journalists and academics on unfounded charges of espionage point to the resurgence of the Federal Security Service as a tool to curtail civic and political freedoms. Federal forces in Chechnya have continued to commit atrocities on a scale rarely seen in Europe since World War II, including the torture and execution of prisoners whose bodies are dumped in mass graves. The Russian government has not held a single high-level commander to account for these actions and ignored two successive resolutions of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.   Russia has made great progress against great odds in overcoming the legacy of its Soviet-era dictatorship. But in the year since it signed the Warsaw declaration, Russia has moved backwards, not forward, jeopardizing some of the greatest gains for democracy and human rights in recent history. The Community of Democracies can perform no greater service than to say that the preservation of Russia's democracy is vital to the world. Russia should not participate in next year's conference unless, at minimum, the government takes credible steps to permit independent media to operate freely, begins effective prosecutions of those responsible for egregious abuses in Chechnya, and issues an invitation to all monitors mandated by the UN to investigate those abuses.   EGYPT    Egypt remains under a State of Emergency that has been in effect since 1981. Not long after the conclusion of the Warsaw summit, Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, one of the country's leading advocates for democratic reform, was arrested along with a number of his colleagues from the Ibn Khaldun Center for Development Studies. Dr. Ibrahim was ultimately charged with defaming the country by criticizing earlier elections and the treatment of Egypt's Coptic minority. He was sentenced to seven years hard labor following a trial before the State Security Court that did not meet international standards. Independent candidates representing the banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood were imprisoned until after voting in the Fall 2000 parliamentary elections was completed. Similar abuses marred elections to the upper body Consultative Council in May. Egypt's participation in the second summit of the Community should require a concrete display of recognition of the principles outlined in the Warsaw Declaration. An end to emergency rule and a halt to trials of political activists and critics before special security courts and military courts would constitute an important step forward.   TUNISIA    Since Tunisia signed the Warsaw Declaration, human rights activists have continued to be summoned before prosecutors or judges, detained for short periods, and deprived of their passports and the freedom to travel. Committed Tunisian democrats such as public health educator Moncef Marzouki, journalist Sihem Ben Sedrine, lawyer Nejib Hosni, and opposition leader Mohamed Mouada are either in jail or face jail terms and bans on working in their profession. Protests by human rights defenders and other activists have increased in the last year, not because the government has become more tolerant of peaceful criticism, but because of growing frustration with the denial of basic rights. Up to one thousand suspected Islamists are in prison, most for nonviolent activities. Basic steps that Tunisia should take to signal its commitment to political liberalization include the legalization of the now-banned Council on National Liberties and the release of all persons detained solely on the basis of peaceful political association and expression.   AZERBAIJAN    In November 2000, just weeks after it signed the Warsaw Declaration, Azerbaijan held parliamentary elections in which ballot stuffing and other falsification were widespread and blatant. Indeed, OSCE observers called the election """"a crash course in ... manipulation."""" The repeat elections in 11 single-mandate constituencies, held on January 11, 2001, did not begin to correct the original, fraudulent vote. Not one of Azerbaijan's five nationwide elections since President Heydar Aliev came to power has met international standards, and the parliamentary elections only solidified his authoritarian control. Continued government harassment of the media and opposition political parties, and the government's failure to make significant progress in releasing political prisoners, also reflect a weak commitment to democratic principles. Lest Azerbaijan be allowed once again to make a mockery of the Community of Democracies, the convening countries should insist on an end to civil defamation suits crippling the media, release of political prisoners, and full implementation of OSCE election-related recommendations.   BURKINA FASO    The actions of President Blaise Compaore and his government continue to hinder the country's progress towards effective national democracy. Government officials enjoy impunity for acts of torture and extrajudicial execution, most notably in the case of journalist Norbert Zongo, who was killed in December 1998. Attempts by opposition groups and human rights activists to protest the lack of progress in the Zongo case have been thwarted by riot police. Municipal elections have been postponed several times. The government of Burkina Faso also faces serious allegations that it facilitated illegal arms shipments to Liberia and Sierra Leone and illicit diamond deals with Angolan rebels. President Compaore's party maintains an overwhelming majority in Parliament, and opposition activities in practice are limited. Before Burkina Faso is invited to continue participating in the Community of Democracies, it should at a minimum be expected to prosecute and punish those responsible for Norbert Zongo's murder. It should also strictly adhere to international arms embargoes and investigate past and present illegal arms transfers - democracies committed to the Community's standards should not be fueling abusive conflicts that violate those standards.   KENYA    Kenya has initiated several reforms during the last year, including the passage of a law to create a Constitution Review Commission. Nevertheless, numerous promises by President Daniel arap Moi have not yet resulted in any significant liberalization. The government continues to stifle peaceful political activity by opposition parties and civil society groups. Power remains concentrated in the executive branch, and officials guilty of corruption and human rights violations are not held accountable. Kenya's progress toward democracy and greater respect for human rights merits particular attention because national elections will be held in 2002. The Community of Democracies can help ensure that these elections adhere to international standards by making Kenya's participation in Seoul contingent upon concrete steps, including lifting bans on rallies by Muungano wa Mageuzi, a pro-democracy coalition, and allowing the new constitutional commission to operate independently.   HAITI    Despite recent signs that Haiti's political crisis may soon be resolved, its progress towards democracy remains uncertain. Local and parliamentary elections held in May 2000 were marred by abuses. The OAS Electoral Monitoring Mission labeled them """"fundamentally flawed"""" and quit Haiti before a second round of balloting. Police forces have failed to protect citizens from politically motivated killings, assaults, threats and intimidation. The justice system remains dysfunctional, as highlighted by the failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of journalist Jean Dominique. Before Haiti is invited to Seoul, the government of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide should take concrete steps to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, including, at a minimum, the establishment of an independent and credible electoral commission and making clear progress toward identifying and punishing the killers of Jean Dominique.   KYRGYZSTAN    Once considered a potential model for democratization in Central Asia, the government of Kyrgyzstan has, in recent years, become increasingly authoritarian. The Akaev government has responded to criticism directed at it by harassing and jailing its critics, including independent journalists, human rights defenders, and political opposition figures. Leading opposition politicians Feliks Kulov and Topchubek Turgunaliev were arrested just prior to the presidential elections of October 2000 and remain in prison today. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe found that the presidential election """"...failed to comply with OSCE commitments for democratic elections."""" These trends led the Community of Democracies to exclude Kyrgyzstan last year after initially including it among participating states. Barring significant progress on implementing OSCE election-related recommendations and the release of political prisoners like Feliks Kulov and Topchubek Turgunaliev, Kyrgyzstan should remain off the list of participating states for the 2002 meeting.   Of the other countries invited to participate last year, KUWAIT, QATAR and YEMEN have done little or nothing to meet the standards of the Warsaw Declaration. In Kuwait, strict Penal Code and Printing and Publications law provisions continue to hinder the work of journalists and writers. Women still do not have the right to vote. Qatar is an absolute monarchy in which freedom of assembly remains severely limited. Political demonstrations are prohibited, as are political parties and domestic human rights organizations. In Yemen, political activists are harassed and detained. The government continues to impose severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the press and local elections in February were marked by widespread irregularities. Absent fundamental democratic reforms that would increase the ability of opposition parties and activists to undertake their activities without retaliation or punishment - and in the case of Kuwait, grant women the right to participate in the political process -- these countries should not be invited to Seoul.   Needless to say, the situations in these and other countries will be fluid over the coming year and a half, and will merit continuing attention. We urge the convening states to consult closely with individuals and organizations independent of the government in these countries of concern to determine whether their participation will advance or hinder the cause of democracy and human rights. We look forward to discussing with you developments in each country as the date of the conference approaches.   Yours sincerely,   Kenneth Roth Executive Director","Africa, Americas, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Haiti, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Egypt, Tunisia, Global",""

Your ratification, as President of the Palestinian Authority, is required before these four men can be brought before the firing squad. Human Rights Watch urges you in the strongest terms to commute these executions. We also urge you to condemn in clear and unequivocal terms vigilante-type killings of alleged collaborators, and to order the authorities to bring to justice those responsible for such killings. Two Palestinians were reportedly shot dead on Wednesday night, August 1, and another seriously wounded. Another suspected collaborator was killed on Tuesday, July 31. According to press reports, militia leaders associated with Fatah have claimed credit for some of these killings and have threatened to carry out further killings.  The sentencing in the Thabit case, which followed earlier sessions on July 28 and 30, reportedly lasted ten minutes. It was originally scheduled for Wednesday but was moved earlier following an Israeli helicopter gunship attack on a Nablus office that killed eight persons, including two political leaders of Hamas, two journalists, and two children, and wounded fifteen. Nablus governor Mahmud Aloul told the media that it was rescheduled so that the verdict could be publicized prior to the funerals of the eight on Wednesday.  Another defendant in the Thabit case, 17-year-old Muhammad Abd al-Rahman, was spared the death penalty as a minor and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. A fifth defendant, Husan Afif Khalil, was released as mentally unfit. The Attorney General for State Security Courts, Khaled al-Qidra, had told Reuters news agency on July 9 that the Palestinian Authority would seek the death penalty for three of those accused in connection with the Thabit killing.  Human Rights Watch has condemned the Israeli policy of """"liquidations"""" and the killing of Thabit Thabit, and has called for the investigation and prosecution of all persons responsible for attacks on civilians. Human Rights Watch opposes the use of the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life, both because of its inherent cruelty, and because of the possibility that individuals wrongly convicted may be executed. We are further disturbed by the Palestinian Authority's recourse to the death penalty following trials before state security and military courts, trials which do not comport with basic international fair trial standards and whose verdicts may have been influenced by political considerations.  On January 13, after a twenty-two month moratorium on executions, Allam Bani Ouda was publicly executed in Nablus and Majdi Mikkawi was executed in Gaza. Both were convicted in State Security Courts of collaboration with the Israeli secret services following summary trials without access to lawyers and the right of appeal, in violation of the most basic fair trial standards. The executions were carried out after you ratified the death sentences.  Also on January 13, Muhammad Dayf Allan al-Khatib and Husam al-Din Musa Hamid were sentenced to death by a Bethlehem Higher State Security Court for collaborating in the killing of Fatah leader Hussain Abeyath, in a trial that lasted five hours and in which only one witness was called. On February 11, Hassan Muhammad Hassan Musallem, a Palestinian security official, was sentenced to death after being convicted by a Hebron military court on charges of collaboration. We request confirmation that these executions have not been, and will not be, carried out.  At a minimum, persons accused of collaboration and treason, as well as all suspects tried before any Palestinian court, should be provided with the following internationally recognized rights:  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty;  to be tried before a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal;  to be informed of the nature and basis of the charges against him or her;  to have adequate time to prepare a defense, to present a defense to the charges, and call witnesses in their defense; to be provided with legal representation, if necessary paid by the state;  to examine the evidence and the witnesses against him or her;  not to be compelled to testify against himself or herself, or to confess guilt; and,  to appeal conviction and sentence to a higher tribunal according to law.  We therefore urge Your Excellency to commute these executions, and to take measures to prevent vigilante killings. It is a matter of deep concern to Human Rights Watch that the Palestinian Authority has reverted to policies that defy the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty by handing down death sentences and carrying out executions. We ask you to ensure the progressive restriction and ultimate elimination of the death penalty in Palestinian law.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/08/01/millions-remain-stateless-denied-several-rights","Millions Remain Stateless Denied Several Rights","Millions Remain Stateless, Denied Several Rights","","08/01/2001","Millions of people in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Middle East have been denied or stripped of citizenship in their own countries solely because of their race, national descent, and gender. In many countries, children born in their mother's country are denied her nationality because women can not transmit nationality. These citizens without citizenship are denied a broad range of civil and political, and economic, social and cultural rights. Governments drive huge populations across international borders by depriving them of citizenship in their own countries, creating refugee crises and generating armed conflict. The breakup of states, the political tensions of war and intercommunal violence, and the creation of new states all provide scenarios in which holding on to or acquiring citizenship may turn on race or ethnicity and the whim of those in power. The situation:    In Europe, the breakup of the Soviet Union led to discriminatory norms for citizenship in many newly independent countries. In the breakup of the former Yugoslavia, the terrorizing and physical expulsion of minorities coincided with measures to deny citizenship to members of ethnic minorities residing there or seeking to return to their homes. In South Asia, the government of Bhutan stripped of citizenship and expelled more than 100,000 Bhutanese of ethnic Nepali origin in the early 1990s, the majority of whom are still refugees.1 In Southeast Asia, the government of Thailand has registered some 300,000 members of the country's ethnic minority hilltribes and issued them special identity documents, but these indigenous people are denied a nationality or full citizenship rights. Hundreds of thousands of other hilltribe villagers are unregistered and officially considered illegal immigrants.2 Myanmar's (Burma's) government excluded hundreds of thousands of members of Burma's minorities from citizenship with a 1982 citizenship law. In the 1990s more than 250,000 Rohingya Muslims denied citizenship fled to seek refuge in neighboring Bangladesh.3 Moves to strip the citizenship of some 1.5 million Zairean citizens of the Banyarwanda ethnic group after 1991 spurred domestic and interstate conflict there.4 Ethiopia summarily denationalized and expelled some 70,000 Ethiopian citizens of Eritrean origin after war broke out with Eritrea in May 1998.5 In the Middle East, Kuwait continues to deny citizenship to some 120,000 Bidun, many of whose families have lived in Kuwait for generations and have no claim to citizenship of another country.6 Syria denies citizenship to some 150,000 Kurds, while recognizing that they are other than mere aliens.7 Millions of Palestinians remain stateless. Citizenship is restricted to the children of male nationals in many countries of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, discouraging female citizens from marrying men of a distinct ethnicity or nationality because their children would be denied citizenship.8     Developments    Denial of citizenship can affect minority populations that are indigenous to a country or have been present for generations’Äîas well as majorities. The end of the apartheid regime in South Africa spelled an end to denationalization taken to an extreme: a """"homelands"""" policy that aimed to make every black South African a citizen of a """"bantustan""""’Äîand no longer a citizen of South Africa.9 Citizenship laws enacted by Slovakia and the Czech Republic after the division of Czechoslovakia served directly to exclude Roma citizens from citizenship in the new republics: international efforts have led to reforms of the relevant laws, although obstacles remain Post-war progress by Ethiopia and Eritrean offers hope of a review of the administrative measures by which Ethiopians of Eritrean origin were summarily stripped of their citizenship. Thailand in August 2000 announced that it would grant citizenship to the descendants of three groups of displaced persons: Burmese who entered the country prior to March 1976, Nepalese migrants, and Chinese migrants who had migrated to Thailand since the 1960s.10     Next Steps    An international campaign for ratification of international agreements on statelessness. Campaigning by childrens' rights activists for the implementation of existing norms in the Convention on the Rights of the Child to combat statelessness. Populations with longstanding claims to nationality in their country of residence whose children remain stateless require urgent attention. International measures of conflict resolution and early warning should address questions of citizenship and denationalization founded on discriminatory grounds. These issues should be recognized as major factors in the generation of massive human rights abuse, including genocide, and armed conflict, and the generation of refugee flows. The U.N. High Commissioner on Human Rights should set in motion a study of the human rights dimension of discriminatory norms by which states determine who is a citizen and naturalize citizens. The Committee on the Rights of the Child should request states to address safeguards against racial, ethnic, and gender discrimination in citizenship laws and practices in their regular reports to the committee. The Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women should consider the discriminatory dimension of citizenship and naturalization policies, in particular the manner in which race, ethnicity, and national origin intersect with gender, and request states to address these issues in their regular reports to the committees.","Global","Crisis and Conflict"

The group is concerned that with only one month remaining before the summit opens in Durban, South Africa, the United States had not yet even decided whether to participate, and is providing only paltry financial support. """"The Bush administration needs to show that it really cares about the problem of racism, in the United States and around the world,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"The way to do that is to use this conference to press for concrete solutions and programs to address the problem, not to sit on the sidelines.""""  The Bush administration is postponing a decision on summit participation until it has assurances that the conference will not take up several hot-button issues. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said on June 20 in a Senate hearing that matters like compensation for slavery and attacks on Israel could derail the meeting and State Department spokesman Richard Boucher has said the United States' participation depends on how these topics are dealt with.  Human Rights Watch also is troubled that many countries were seeking to single out Israel for condemnation of racist practices. While it has documented and denounced Israeli abuses against Palestinians and called on Israel to respect the right of Palestinian refugees to return, it stressed that if the conference were going to name countries which practice severe forms of racism, its list should be much longer.  At the same time, Human Rights Watch emphasized that if the United States wants to influence the outcome of this debate, it must stay engaged. """"The Administration thinks it can delegitimize the conference by staying away,"""" Brody said. """"It's only going to succeed in ceding important decisions to others.""""  A Bush administration paper has also warned the meeting not to apportion blame for past injustices or to seek to exact compensation for these acts. Human Rights Watch has said that governments should compensate groups that suffer today because of slavery or other severe racist practices and it has proposed the establishment of truth commissions to examine how a government's past racist practices contribute to contemporary deprivation and to propose methods of redress.  Human Rights Watch was also critical of the U.S. lack of financial support for the meeting. The Clinton administration committed an initial $250,000 toward the conference before it left office, and the Bush administration has not increased that. By contrast, the United States provided several million dollars to the 1995 United Nations conference on women in Beijing.  Human Rights Watch said that it hopes that the conference, in addition to addressing past injustices, will establish concrete programs to stamp out racism today and that it will recognize caste-based discrimination as a form of racism, address the racist treatment of refugees and migrants and press governments to review how their laws and practices favor one race over another.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/28/world-conference-against-racism-backgrounder","World Conference Against Racism Backgrounder","World Conference Against Racism Backgrounder","","07/28/2001","(New York) - Human Rights Watch is addressing the World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in five principal areas:  Caste Discrimination Refugees, Asylum Seekers, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons Discrimination and Citizenship Discrimination in the Administration of Justice Reparations   Caste Discrimination  More than 250 million people worldwide suffer under a hidden apartheid of segregation, modern-day slavery, and other extreme forms of discrimination because they were born into a marginalized caste. Caste discrimination has been a shameful secret for too long-and some of the governments which most need to fight caste discrimination have been the most strident in demanding this issue be excluded from the World Conference.    The World Conference should recognize that caste-based discrimination blights the lives of hundreds of millions-and that international programs are required to remedy its consequences and to establish practical measures to facilitate its abolition.   Refugees, Asylum Seekers, Migrants, and Internally Displaced Persons  Throughout the world, refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and internally displaced persons are the victims of racial discrimination, racist attacks, xenophobia and ethnic intolerance. Racism is both a cause and a product of forced displacement, and an obstacle to its solution. In 2000, some 150 million migrants were living outside their countries of birth. Of these, some 50 million people were forcibly displaced as a result of persecution, conflict, and human rights violations. Industrialized states have introduced a barrage of restrictive policies and practices over the past decade targeting asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants. Even traditionally generous host countries in the developing world, often over-burdened with their own social and economic problems, have become increasingly reluctant to host large refugee populations.    The World Conference should recognize discrimination against refugees, asylum seekers, migrants, and internally displaced persons as a contemporary form of racism. It should call on governments to reverse policies and practices that discriminate against refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants; to reinforce the existing international refugee protection regime; and to introduce new protection standards where necessary.   Discrimination and Citizenship  Whole populations have been denied nationality in their own countries-or been stripped of their citizenship-because of their race or ethnicity. Some have been present in a country for generations, often predating their country's independence; others are indigenous peoples. When citizenship is restricted to the children of male nationals, female citizens are discouraged from marrying men of a different race or nationality because their children would be denied citizenship. Disputes over nationality have generated refugee crises, where particular ethnic groups have been arbitrarily stripped of their citizenship prior to their forced expulsion.    The World Conference should place the issue of racial discrimination in the conferring of citizenship firmly on the agenda.   Discrimination in the Administration of Justice  Members of racial, ethnic, and other minorities or vulnerable groups often face harassment, arbitrary detention, abusive treatment by law enforcement, and disparate treatment by prosecutors and the courts. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), to which 157 states are party, obliges states to nullify any law or practice which has the effect of creating or perpetuating racial discrimination. But drafts of the World Conference program of action have called for measures to address discrimination in the administration of justice only where discriminatory intent can be discerned. Ostensibly race- or descent-neutral laws can have a disparate impact on vulnerable minorities-or even majorities-as a consequence of prosecutorial discretion, or sentencing policies, or the nature of the law itself.    The World Conference should recommend measures to identify and to remedy the racist effect of law or practice in the administration of justice, even in the absence of racist intent.   Reparations  Governments responsible should provide reparations to counter the most severe continuing effects of slavery, segregation, and other extreme forms of racism. National and international panels should be created with maximum transparency and public participation to identify and acknowledge past abuses, and to guide action to counter their present-day effects. These panels should educate the public, acknowledge responsibility, and propose methods of redress and making amends. They would focus on tracing these effects not for particular individuals but for groups.  A primary purpose of reparations would be to address the social and economic foundations of victims' marginalization today-through means such as investment in education, housing, health care, or job training.    The World Conference should call for reparations to address the continuing effects of slavery, segregation, and other extreme forms of racism.","",""

Less than two years later, when the Indonesian parliament forced him from office not even halfway through his term on July 21, 2001, the country was as divided and disordered as he found it. Basic reforms, if attempted at all, were barely off the ground, and the army, still operating largely beyond the reach of the law, was regaining much of the political clout it had lost with the 1998 ouster of Soeharto. There is no question that the deck was stacked against Wahid (or Gus Dur as he is often known) when he took office. From the start, he confronted crisis piled upon crisis and a politically fractious society with little experience with politics. The economy was in tatters. Soeharto was gone, but four decades of authoritarian rule (the last thirty-two under Soeharto) had left government institutions discredited and regional and ethnic conflicts on the rise, each group believing that it's time had come. State institutions simply lacked the political know-how and legitimacy to play much of a role in resolving the conflicts. The judiciary was corrupt to the core. And Gus Dur himself controlled only 11% of the seats in the parliament, his victory due to his own effective coalition building and the missteps by the candidate with the most votes in the general election, Megawati Sukarnoputri.  When Wahid took office, Soeharto's family, wealthy business associates, and many supporters among active and retired military officers also remained powerful, if less visible than before. Throughout his term, conspiratorial reports continued to circulate of efforts by Soeharto backers to subvert any reform that might compromise old business interests. Some of the reports were plausible, some not; all were virtually impossible to prove or disprove.  Still, the situation was not hopeless. Public demands for reform were high. Outgoing President Habibie, who, as Soeharto's vice president had assumed the presidency in 1998 when Soeharto was forced to step down, had taken some important first steps. Under Habibie, the government released political prisoners, ratified the international convention against torture, formally removed the police from military control, agreed to a UN-supervised referendum on the political future of East Timor, and, in June 1999, lifted restrictions on political parties and presided over the most democratic elections in Indonesia since 1955.  Habibie, however, was too close to Soeharto and his cronies and, as the Timor carnage vividly demonstrated, he was unwilling or unable to move against military leaders responsible for forced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings, or to put an end to abuses in trouble spots.  Initial hopes for Gus Dur's presidency were bolstered by some early successes. Immediately following his election in October 1999, Gus Dur appointed the first civilian defense minister in decades; in February 2000, he managed to sideline General Wiranto, who had been in command of the Indonesian military during the scorched earth destruction of East Timor and was arguably the single most powerful man in the country at the time Gus Dur took office; in April 2000, Gus Dur formally disbanded Bakorstanas, the hated internal security organization. Under Gus Dur, basic freedoms such as freedom of the press and free association flourished. Gus Dur encouraged openness through statements in defense of free expression, including for unpopular groups such as communists and political dissidents. Gus Dur brought a religiously and ethnically diverse group of people into leadership positions. He made an historic fence-mending visit to East Timor and apologized for the sufferings Indonesia had caused. And, though the process was painfully slow and the courts have still not yet been established, he supported legislation to create new human rights courts to address both present and past atrocities.  Despite these steps, Gus Dur paid relatively little attention to long-term institution building. He regularly squandered opportunities for reform. He focused instead on inter-elite politicking and on countering real and perceived threats from Soeharto supporters. Despite his attention to such threats, however, Gus Dur failed spectacularly to do the political groundwork necessary to push the old forces aside.  From the start, Gus Dur began alienating people who should have been important allies. He repeatedly traveled overseas as domestic political fires burned at home, casually announcing the sacking of key government and military personnel thousands of miles from Jakarta, which rankled. His continual shakeups of the military hierarchy were so resented that they eventually united officers against him. Unfounded corruption allegations against -- and the firing of -- key members of his own cabinet such as mainstream economist Laksamana Sukardi, a key advisor of Megawati, turned many pro-reform moderates against him. Many other politicians came to view Gus Dur as imperious, acting as if he had no need of coalition partners to govern when in fact he controlled only a minuscule percentage of parliamentary votes.  Gus Dur's failure to consult with other power blocs in government eventually led key groups, particularly the military, to ignore him. This pattern was first evident on Aceh where, for a while, Gus Dur acted as a break on a full-scale military offensive. When it was clear that Gus Dur was losing political momentum, senior military leaders embarked on the offensive anyway with disastrous results. His blindness made him dependent on oral sources and he came to depend almost exclusively on a too narrow circle of friends. His information on conflicts going on elsewhere in Indonesia was often embarrassingly wrong.  Eventually, Gus Dur turned to authoritarian tactics to try and stop the parliamentary moves against him. He made no secret of the fact that he wanted to declare a state of emergency and dissolve the parliament, unilaterally declaring that the impeachment moves against him were unconstitutional without acknowledging the wide power given to parliament in Indonesia's constitution. The army's decision to side with the parliament put it in the paradoxical position of defending democracy against Indonesia's great democratic hope. In his last desperate act as president, when he tried to impose a quasi-state of emergency, the army and police politely declined to go along. Gus Dur, a man who came to power through astute parliamentary politics, proved to be an utter failure at the daily politics necessary to run the country effectively.  Gus Dur's record was particular disappointing on trouble spots such as Aceh and Papua. Gus Dur recognized that violently suppressing separatist sentiment in the long-term was likely to backfire and to further fuel armed opposition to Jakarta. He supported a cease-fire in Aceh and welcomed the mediation efforts of the Geneva-based Humanitarian Dialogue Center. In Papua, he apologized for four decades of mistreatment of the population under de facto martial law, and encouraged Papuan leaders to hold province-wide congresses in which they openly expressed their grievances with Jakarta and their political aspirations.  But these initial steps were not carried through in any consistent fashion as Gus Dur's attention repeatedly returned to real and perceived political enemies in Jakarta. Gus Dur failed to resolve the refugee crisis in Indonesian West Timor, where tens of thousands of East Timorese, many of whom had been forcibly displaced from their homes by army-backed militias at the time of the 1999 U.N.-supervised referendum, continued to live in often-deplorable conditions. He was similarly ineffective in addressing economic and social resentments that fueled spiraling religious and ethnic conflicts in the Moluccas and in South Kalimantan.  Eventually, Gus Dur made feeble attempts to use his early initiatives and good relations with leaders in troublespots for purposes of political blackmail, publicly asserting (without factual basis) that five provinces would secede if he were ousted. By the end, the military simply returned to increased use of military force in trouble spots, the approach it had long favored, paying no attention to the president's wishes.  Perhaps Gus Dur's most glaring failure was his failure to take decisive action to confront Indonesia's violent past and thereby provide greater protection against future violence. He never clearly articulated the extent to which Indonesia's current crises reflected the legacy of state-backed violence bequeathed by Soeharto, let alone how, practically, the nation should go about facing that legacy in building a new society.  Despite the horrific record of the armed forces since 1965, not a single high-ranking military officer was prosecuted during his tenure. For every step forward, it seems, there was a step backward. Gus Dur publicly apologized for the role played by his own organization, the NU, in mass killings of communists and suspected communists in the mid 1960s, but he did not take a firm stance in support of creating a framework for public resentments to be aired and a more honest telling to emerge. On occasion, he publicly expressed support for tribunals for past atrocities, but he did almost nothing to see that such tribunals were established and, to date, they have not been. Indeed, soon after ousting Wiranto in February 2000, Gus Dur unilaterally announced that he would pardon Wiranto if Wiranto were found responsible for the carnage in East Timor. A year and a half later, no moves have been made to prosecute Wiranto. On the critical issue of establishing accountability for abuses so that the violent policies of the past are not repeated, a near silence prevailed under Gus Dur.","Asia, Indonesia",""

He is being detained on orders of Argentine Federal Judge María Servini de Cubría, who recently received a formal extradition request from the Italian courts.     José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division, urged President De La Rúa to allow the extradition to go forward. """"After twenty years of impunity, this may be the final chance to bring this brutal criminal to justice,"""" he said. """"There is no valid reason to refuse Italy's request.""""     Astiz narrowly escaped extradition to France in 1982 after he surrendered to British troops during the Falklands/Malvinas conflict. Here again, there may be official resistance to his extradition. The day after Astiz was arrested, Argentine Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena said that Argentina would not extradite him. """"Crimes committed in Argentina, whoever the person is who commits them, must be judged by Argentine judges,"""" the minister reportedly said.     Astiz is sought in Italy because of his role in the kidnapping of Angela María Aieta, Giovani Pegoraro, and Pegoraro's daughter Susana. Angela María Aieta was abducted from her home on August 5, 1976, and was held at the Navy Mechanics School (ESMA), a secret detention center. A survivor of the ESMA camp has testified that she saw Aieta being taken away, possibly for execution. Giovani and Susana Pegoraro were kidnapped in a railway station on June 18, 1977, when Susana was five months pregnant. None of the three were ever heard from again.     An estimated 5,000 people """"disappeared"""" from the camp during the dictatorship. Thousands were drugged, boarded on planes and dropped unconscious but alive into the Atlantic.     Astiz, known as the """"Blond Angel,"""" was a member of the notorious 3.3.2 task force at ESMA, which specialised in abductions. He was said to frequently watch torture sessions in order to act quickly on the information gleaned. He is also wanted for trial in Sweden in connection with the """"disappearance"""" of a young Swedish-Argentine, Dagmar Hagelin. An Argentine court closed the case in 1986 because of the statute of limitations.     Astiz also participated as an undercover agent in the """"disappearance"""" in 1977 of two French nuns, Alice Domon and Leonie Duquet. In 1990 a French court sentenced Astiz in absentia to life imprisonment for this crime, but Argentina refused to extradite him.     In March 1998, Astiz was given a three-month suspended prison sentence for boasting in an interview that he was """"the most highly skilled person to kill a politician or a journalist."""" Only then was he dismissed from the navy. Aside from this conviction, he has enjoyed complete impunity in Argentina.     """"Argentina has had twenty years to bring Astiz to justice, but has failed to do so,"""" Vivanco said.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/27/indonesia-sea-troubles","For Indonesia A Sea of Troubles","For Indonesia, A Sea of Troubles","","07/27/2001","Megawati Sukarnoputri, Indonesia's new president, has a mess on her hands. The economy is in tatters, regions are in revolt and the government has almost broken down. So what did Mrs. Megawati do the weekend before becoming president, as the political crisis reached its height? She went to see """"Shrek,"""" the animated movie about a friendly ogre. That is typical of her detachment. Maybe she didn't want to seem to be grasping as the presidency came closer, or maybe she wanted to project an image of normalcy. But now Mrs. Megawati is president and needs to stop pretending that nothing is amiss. She has to move decisively on a number of fronts and demonstrate that she has the vision, capacity and authority to provide much-needed leadership for the world's fourth-largest country. The first priority is her cabinet. She needs to be inclusive — her predecessor, Abdurrahman Wahid, was not — so that key political parties receive posts and some of the damage wrought by the power struggle between the legislative and executive branches can be repaired. She should make certain that the defense minister is a capable civilian who can ensure civilian control of the military. She needs a justice minister who is committed to legal reform and who can restore respect for the courts and an attorney general willing and able to show that neither army officers nor politicians are above the law. She also needs economic advisers who can steer the country through its debt crisis, banking problems and decentralization of fiscal authority. The second priority is to demonstrate that she can move beyond her nationalist origins. One of the many mistakes Mr. Wahid made early in his presidency was to give Mrs. Megawati, as vice president, responsibility for the rebellion-wracked province of Papua, at the eastern end of the Indonesian archipelago, and for the Moluccan islands, where conflict has been raging for the last two years. Mrs. Megawati showed no aptitude for understanding or addressing the grievances in those regions. She will have to do better as president or face further outbreaks of violence and an increase in the more than one million citizens currently displaced from their homes. She has to move quickly to show she will not be a pawn of the military officers who flocked to her party out of displeasure with Mr. Wahid. Mrs. Megawati's handling of the pro-independence rebellion in Aceh — an oil-rich province on Sumatra — will be crucial. In recent weeks, military commanders all but ignored Mr. Wahid and pressed ahead with a counterinsurgency offensive that has resulted in numerous executions and disappearances. Last week, paramilitary police in Aceh arrested members of a negotiating team whose security the Indonesian government had guaranteed, effectively putting an end to dialogue. Many Acehnese fear that a Megawati presidency will mean open season on civilians. She should release the negotiators and those Acehnese imprisoned for peaceful advocacy of independence — and commit her government to finding a political and economic, rather than a military, solution. President Megawati must also move forward with prosecutions for human rights violations in East Timor, Papua and Aceh. Nothing she has said or done indicates she has the remotest interest in doing so; indeed, she has publicly defended the East Timorese militia thug Eurico Gutteres — his force, together with soldiers, sacked the city of Dili after the pro-independence vote in 1999 — as a hero of national unity. She appointed him a youth leader of her party. But her closeness to the military might make a move toward formal indictments more feasible than it was for Mr. Wahid, and she could demonstrate her commitment to the rule of law by making one. Restoring economic health is essential, and Mrs. Megawati has some capable advisers. Their ability to function will depend not only on the international economic environment but on how well a Megawati administration succeeds in handling regional conflicts, which are of direct concern to foreign investors. It will also depend on how she handles corruption. Some have compared Mrs. Megawati to Benazir Bhutto, not only because she inherited a political mantle from her father, but because her husband is a businessman of dubious repute. His behavior, as well as hers, is going to be under scrutiny. Indonesia's new president has made a career out of standing by silently as her rivals self-destruct. Now she is going to have to set policies, based on sound analysis of the country's ills, and see that they are carried out. If she fails, it could be the nation, not the political opposition, that falls apart. Sidney Jones is Asia Director for Human Rights Watch.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Talks between Vietnam, Cambodia, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) are scheduled to open today in Hanoi, Vietnam, to discuss the fate of more than 300 Montagnard asylum seekers from Vietnam's Central highlands who are currently under U.N. protection at two sites in Cambodia. UNHCR has said that 107 of the border crossers do not qualify for protection, and forty-one have already had to leave one of the sites. Cambodian Ministry of Interior officials have said that all those """"screened out"""" by UNHCR would be repatriated, forcibly if necessary. """"We continue to receive reports of intimidation and surveillance of ethnic minorities in Vietnam,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"Until independent observers have better access to the Central Highlands, human rights conditions improve, and we can be sure there's no threat of retaliation, no one should be sent back.""""  Several hundred indigenous minority people from Vietnam have fled to Cambodia since February 2001, when widespread rural demonstrations over land rights spurred a government crackdown. Recent reports show that police are continuing to interrogate and monitor suspected leaders of the demonstrations and those active in the Protestant """"house church"""" movement, which is seen as a threat to Vietnamese Communist Party authority. Family members of individuals who have fled to Cambodia since the demonstrations have been put under intensive surveillance, as have former members of the guerrilla army FULRO (Front Unifie pour la Lutte des Races Opprimes).  In April, thirty-eight asylum seekers who fled to Cambodia were resettled in the United States. From March until May, prior to the establishment of a UNHCR presence in Cambodia's border provinces, Cambodian authorities forcibly repatriated more than 100 asylum seekers back to Vietnam. Since mid-May, when UNHCR secured Cambodian government approval to provide protection to asylum seekers and established two sites in the Cambodian border provinces of Ratanakiri and Mondolkiri, the number of deportations appears to have dropped. On July 25, UNHCR stated that it had screened all of the Montagnard refugees, determining that more than one hundred did not qualify for Refugee protection. Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng then said the screened-out refugees were """"illegal immigrants [who] must return home."""" Human Rights Watch said it was premature for UNHCR to make decisions that specific individuals were not entitled to protection in Cambodia because there is still no reliable assessment of conditions on the Vietnamese side of the border. Until now, access to the region has been strictly controlled by Vietnamese authorities. No UNHCR personnel have yet visited the region and the few visits by international observers that Vietnamese authorities have allowed were tightly restricted.  Background According to Human Rights Watch interviews with recent refugee arrivals in Cambodia, ongoing human rights violations in the Central Highlands include:  1. Dozens of people have been detained for questioning at commune and district police stations since the February demonstrations in which thousands of ethnic minority people in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces in Vietnam's Central Highlands protested against land encroachment and religious repression. Some were beaten, kicked, or shocked with electric truncheons by police officers upon arrest or during transport to police stations, and in a smaller number of cases, during interrogation. An initial wave of arrests in early February of suspected leaders of the demonstrations was followed by arrests in March in both Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces of others accused of being """"troublemakers."""" Currently at least a dozen ethnic minority people are thought to be imprisoned in the provincial prisons in Ban Methuot and Pleiku cities for their participation in the demonstrations. It is not known whether any have been officially charged, although Vietnamese officials have announced that trials will be conducted for those accused of damaging national security and disturbing public order.  Immediately after the demonstrations, military reinforcements - Including helicopters and tanks - were dispatched to the Central Highlands. In many areas, these military units remained stationed at commune (or subdistrict) centers. Tanks have been moved as recently as the first week in June, when they were moved from Ban Methuot city in the direction of Buon Sup village in Dak Lak province.  2. The Vietnamese government has stepped up its suppression of freedom of assembly and religion. Human Rights Watch has received reports of security forces burning down several Protestant churches in Gia Lai since the demonstrations. At least one villager was killed by security forces in a standoff with villagers attending a large church gathering at Plei Lao village, Chu Se district, Gia Lai on March 10. Protestant religious services are banned, except those conducted among family members in homes. Villagers are now largely forbidden to meet in groups of more than five. A local decree in Dak Lak province calls for gatherings of more than five people to be dispersed. 3. Freedom of movement is also restricted, with authorities requiring written permission to be secured in advance of any temporary absence from the village, making it very difficult for farmers to go to work in their fields.  4. Access to the Central Highlands by foreign media, diplomats and the UN remains restricted. Western media were escorted on one tightly-controlled government sponsored tour to Gia Lai and Dak Lak in mid-March. U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson, who was finally granted approval to tour the highlands in July, was highly critical of provincial officials in Gia Lai for aggressively trying to control his visit to the province and preventing him from talking freely with villagers. He said officials were more open and candid in the two other highland provinces he visited, Dak Lak and Lam Dong.  Human Rights Watch called on Vietnamese authorities to cease repression of house church leaders, banning of meetings, and arbitrary police surveillance. It also called for the Vietnamese government to release the names of those imprisoned in provincial prisons or district and commune police stations and of those slated to be tried in Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces.  Human Rights Watch urged Cambodia to continue to provide temporary asylum and protection to existing refugees and asylum seekers and to any new asylum seekers from Vietnam. It also called on Cambodian authorities to provide protection to Montagnard asylum seekers found not only well inside Cambodia's boundaries but also upon arrival at the border. Push-backs of Montagnards at the border could amount to a violation of the fundamental principle of refoulement - the obligation of states such as Cambodia, which are signatory to the Refugee Convention, not to return any person to a country where his or her life or freedom may be threatened.","Asia, Cambodia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers"

In releasing the French edition of their report on the plight of human rights defenders in Tunisia, Human Rights Watch and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders also endorsed the courageous open letter written earlier this month by Tunis judge Mokhtar Yahyaoui. In that letter, Judge Yahyaoui deplored that judges in Tunisia are """"obliged to render verdicts dictated to them by the executive authorities."""" Following release of his letter, Judge Yahyaoui was promptly suspended from his post, a decision that the rights groups said should be reversed.   The Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders is a joint program of the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH) and the World Organization Against Torture (OMCT).   The report is being released on the occasion of a press conference convened in Paris by four European Parliament members - Harlem Desir, Olivier Dupuis, Roselyne Vaschetta, Helene Flautre - who recently visited Tunisia. This press conference takes place on 26 July 2001 at 11 am at the Information Office of the European Parliament (288 Boulevard Saint Germain, 75007 Paris).   In the report, Tunisie: Le procès contre la ligue des droits de l'Homme: un affront à tous les militants, Human Rights Watch and the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders expose the government's utilization of the courts to impede human rights activity. On June 21, the Tunis Appeals Court affirmed a lower court decision voiding the internal elections of the Tunisian Human Rights League, which brought into the executive committee a dynamic group of activists determined to expose and denounce abuses. In a seeming paradox, the Appeals Court ordered the same committee to organize new elections. Since the Appeals Court decision, the League's executive committee has persisted in criticizing human rights violations, prompting a warning from the Ministry of Interior that it was proscribed from carrying out any activity other than organizing new elections.   The other leading human rights organization, the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), remains illegal pursuant to a 1999 decision by the Ministry of Interior rejecting its application for a license. The CNLT appealed this decision more than two years ago. But in a sign that this review process is not independent, the tribunal has not responded to the CNLT's appeal.   Tunisian courts continue to restrict and imprison individual members of the CNLT. Today marks one month in detention for CNLT spokeswoman Sihem Ben Sedrine, on charges of defamation and disseminating """"false news"""" in connection with her criticism of the Tunisian judiciary. Tunisian law, in violation of the right to free speech, provides prison terms for persons convicted of these offenses. The judge investigating Ben Sedrine's case has compounded that violation by using his discretion to place her in pretrial detention.   CNLT member Moncef Marzouki is also a victim of judicial arbitrariness. The one-year prison sentence he faces after being convicted of defamation and membership in an illegal association, namely the CNLT, is currently being appealed as too lenient by the state prosecutor. On June 24, the Tunis Appeals Court postponed the case until September 29 on the anomalous grounds that the original verdict was missing from Marzouki's dossier. This delay keeps the risk of prison hanging over Marzouki while authorities use the pending case as a pretext to prevent him from traveling abroad.

I heard my father, who is blind, yelling, """"they're killing me."""" We hid there for almost an hour listening to the gunfire and sounds of them singing and clapping. They one yelled, """"ceasefire,"""" and shortly after I heard footsteps coming into the house. My son, who'd been shot through the knee, was crying from the pain but I told him if he didn't be silent they'd kill us. Thank God they didn't find us. Sometime later my brother came into the house and pulled us out but a few meters from the house I found my father's body. I guess he'd tried to find his way out of the house and was caught. My brother and I cried as we passed by his body; he was lying on his back and it looked like his stomach had been cut open.  They put my son and I down next to some other wounded. A few yards away they were laying down the bodies of the dead. Over the next hour they kept bringing more and more bodies from all over the village. I counted twenty-four dead including two RUF combatants. I knew every one of them.   """"Sara,"""" age twelve, was left for dead during the Yiraia attack, after they cut at least five gashes around her neck with a machete. Her mother was shot and killed just meters away.

My mother dashed down the verandah but they caught her and then shot her. She fell about five meters from the house. By this time several of them had surrounded me. They ordered me to sit down and one held me tight by the head while the other cut my neck with his machete. I tried to protect my neck with my left hand but they slashed it. They said in the Kono language, """"you'll be dead - all of you are RUF wives."""" After cutting me, I lie still, pretending to be dead. I was bleeding so much. After a while I heard them say, """"she done die."""" Then I crawled into the bush and hid until my family came to help me.   """"Aminata,"""" who had just given birth three days before a June 17, 2001 attack on the town of Worodu, described seeing her younger sister shot as the CDF militias attacked the town:   I was lying in bed with my newborn baby. I'd sent my younger sister Fina to go tend to the rice field earlier in the morning. Suddenly, Fina came running into the house and said the RUF had told all civilians to leave the town because the CDF were about to attack. As I struggled to get up we started hearing gunfire. I started gathering my things but Fina said, """"leave everything, let's go."""" As we neared the end of the village I was in terrible pain and insisted that we hide in a nearby house. Fina wanted to keep going and as we were arguing, a bullet caught her. I yelled, """"Fina, Fina, get up,"""" but she died quickly. I rushed over to get Fina's three year old girl who'd been strapped to her back and only then did I see that the same bullet had also gone through both of the child's legs.' I saw the CDF clapping and singing as they approached the town and ran quickly into the house to hide. The wounded girl cried but I told her to shhh. Later we slipped out the back and into the bush.   """"Mani,"""" a twenty-four-year old coffee farmer from Sukudu village in Kono District, had recently returned to his village after spending three years as a refugee in Guinea. He described how he was shot through both legs by CDF-militiamen during an attack on his village on July 11, 2001, and was accused by the CDF of being an RUF combatant:   At around 7:00 a.m. I was getting ready to go spend the day in the fields when I heard a few gunshots. At first I thought it was the RUF who hang around our village letting off a few rounds. There were usually four RUF rebels who're based in our village and besides making us give them rice, they pretty much leave us alone. Then, as I was leaving my house I started hearing more firing and suddenly saw a Kamajor standing about ten meters in front of me. As I tried to run I saw him aim his gun directly at me and fire. The bullet went through both of my legs. Then as the firing was going on, the Kamajor ran into the town and I pulled myself into the bush to hide. They looted our village; my brother was abducted by them to carry away the loot. After walking to their base in a village called Yaradu-Sandor, he was let go. Now we have nothing and I can't walk. We came back from Guinea because we heard there was a ceasefire and that everything would be ok. I came as a refugee with practically nothing and now I have even less.   In the first week of July, RUF rebels attacked the village of Porpon, killing at least three children and wounding several more civilians. An elderly man, also interviewed by Human Rights Watch, had his left ear cut off. At least sixteen civilians were abducted to carry away looted property. One of the abducted described the brutal killing of the children and explained why he believed the RUF's attack was retaliation for the June 17 attack on the village of Yiraia.   It's farming season and on the day of the attack I was in the fields with six of my friends and family members, including three children. At around 10:30 a.m. I suddenly saw nine armed men; some in uniform and some in civilian dress. Five had guns and the rest were with machetes. We know the RUF and I recognized at least three of them. We've been living with them for years and since the ceasefire hadn't had too many problems except their system of forced taxation for money and rice. We tried to run but they caught five of us, including the children aged ten, five and about two. They tied us together at the waist and told us to start walking. One of the RUF was carrying the two year old. They said, """"today some of you will die; you people are Kamajors."""" As we walked the children were crying and slowing us down. The commander was complaining and about half an hour later, he ordered us to halt and then took his machete and started hitting us. First he hit me twice on the head and on my left arm, and then he started hitting the children one after the other. It was pathetic. The children were crying and begging but he killed them anyway. We had to leave them right there by the side of the path. Then we walked into Porpon where I saw other RUF's had captured seven more of us from the village. After giving us all loot to carry, they walked us to Yiraia where we saw RUF big man Demba Marrah who started accusing us of being Kamajors. He was angry because some weeks earlier the Kamajros had attacked his village and killed many of his people including his mother. But we have nothing to do with it. The Kamajors have never even come to our village. He told us to strip off our clothes and then put us in a house and there we found even more people from our village. The RUF would always come around and tell us we were going to be killed. Two days some shots were fired, and in the panic I was able to run away.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, Torture, United Nations"

In a July 23 letter to the U.N. Secretary-General, the U.N. Security Council approved plans to move forward with the court, which will prosecute people accused of crimes against humanity and war crimes in the Sierra Leone conflict over the last five years.  “It’s time for governments to pull out their checkbooks,” said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “The Secretary-General and the Security Council have taken an important step to get this court off the ground. But it’s essential that more states pledge funds to give the court a solid footing.”  Human Rights Watch urged permanent members of the Security Council that have not yet committed funds to do so without delay.  The Secretary-General has stated that as of July 6, 2001, states had pledged $15 million for the court’s first year of operation, and $20.4 million for the next two years. Under the current budget for the court, $16.8 million is required for the first year and $40 million for the next two years.  These budget requirements have already been scaled back from the U.N. Secretariat's initial budget proposal of $114 million for three years of operations.  The court, which will be created by an agreement between the United Nations and Sierra Leone, will have mixed national and international components. It will be based in Freetown, Sierra Leone, and will have both international and Sierra Leonean judges, prosecutors and staff.  “The failure to establish this court with a sound financial basis would send a terrible message, that the international community is not concerned about justice for Sierra Leone,” said Takirambudde. “Meanwhile, potential defendants have been sitting in detention in Freetown while financing efforts have dragged on.”  The court’s Management Committee should play an important role in scrutinizing the court’s expenditures in a transparent manner, Human Rights Watch said.  In a November 2000 letter to the Security Council, Human Rights Watch stressed that the court, in order to avoid the appearance of selective justice, should prosecute those who bear the greatest responsibility for crimes and not solely members of the rebel Revolutionary United Front.  As of mid-July, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Mauritius, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States were among the states that had pledged monetary contributions.  Human Rights Watch has extensively documented the kinds of crimes that the Special Court for Sierra Leone will be addressing.","Africa, Sierra Leone, Global","International Justice, United Nations"

Gao, a U.S. permanent resident, was convicted in a closed trial on charges of collecting intelligence for Taiwan and sentenced to ten years in prison. She has applied for medical parole and could be expelled and returned to the United States ahead of a scheduled trip to China by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell on July 28. """"This case was a miscarriage of justice from the beginning,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, Academic Freedom Director for Human Rights Watch. """"The basis for the charges was unclear, the supposed confession was almost certainly made under duress, and the outcome was preordained.""""  Gao met with her lawyer for the first time on July 10. It was her first meeting with the outside world after she was arrested February 11 at Beijing airport, as she was heading home after visiting family with her husband and five-year-old son. She was not indicted until July 17.  Gao's trial followed by ten days the trial and conviction of Dr. Li Shaomin, a naturalized U.S. citizen convicted of spying for Taiwan. At that trial, the prosecutors put into evidence a deposition from Gao, the first time the two cases had been explicitly linked. Beijing's No.1 Intermediate People's Court heard both cases.  While a U.S. consular official and interpreter attended Li's trial, Gao's trial received no such outside scrutiny; she is a U.S. permanent resident but not a U.S. citizen, and received no such privileges. Her husband, Xue Donghua, a newly naturalized citizen was denied a visa to attend her trial.  """"If and when Li and Gao are deported from China, it's essential not to forget the other academics still in detention,"""" Zia-Zarifi said. """"China should not be rewarded for detaining scholars and others engaged in legitimate academic or business pursuits.""""  Among the remaining detainees are three U.S.-based individuals. They are Wu Jianmin, Liu Yiaping, and Tan Guangguang (also written as Qin Guangguang). Wu is a writer and former staff member at the Communist Party School in Beijing; Liu is a businessman; and Tan is a pharmaceutical expert. Another scholar, Xu Zerong, has been in detention for nine months. He holds a Ph.D. from Oxford University, where his dissertation was on the role of the People's Liberation Army during the Korean War. It is crucial that international pressure be maintained for the release of all four.  Noting that U.S. President George Bush had personally intervened on the cases of Gao and Li, Human Rights Watch said it was important for the international community to remain engaged on behalf of all others arbitrarily detained in China and for Powell to press for significant progress on human rights prior to Bush's scheduled visit to China in late October.","Asia, China and Tibet","Free Speech"

These atrocities include thekilling of over twenty civilians by pro-government militias.   According to extensive interviews conducted by Human Rights Watch, both the government-allied civil defense force militias (CDF) and rebels from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) have been attacking and killing civilians in the northern Kono and Koinadugu districts of Sierra Leone. Human Rights Watch called on the United Nations to deploy peacekeepers to the region as quickly as possible.   """"Civilians are being targeted in deadly battles of retaliation,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director for Africa at Human Rights Watch. """"Neither the RUF nor the CDF make much effort to distinguish between military and civilian targets. The U.N. has to act immediately to stop these atrocities.""""   Human Rights Watch has interviewed numerous victims and witnesses who described attacks by the CDF militias in June and July against the RUF-controlled towns of Worodu, Yiraia, Sukudu and Mansofinia. In the four attacks documented by Human Rights Watch, at least twenty-four civilians, including nine women and nine children were killed, and some nineteen more civilians, including eleven children, were wounded.   In the most serious recent incident, on June 17, CDF militias, commonly known as the Kamajors or Donzos, killed at least twenty-one civilians in the town of Yiraia. In apparent retaliatory attacks in late June and early July, the RUF launched raids against surrounding villagers whom they accuse of supporting the CDF militias. The RUF killed at least three civilians, wounded several, and abducted sixteen people.   Eleven witnesses and wounded survivors from Yiraia described how in the early morning of June 17, scores of CDF militiamen armed with automatic rifles and machetes attacked the village located some thirty-five miles north of the diamond-rich town of Koidu. Several people, including one elderly man and at least two children, were burned after the attackers set fire to numerous houses in the village. One twelve-year-old survivor with at least five deep gashes around her neck, was left for dead after a militiaman attempted to cut her throat. Another man, shot three times by the attackers, described how his mother, father, sister and son were all killed during the attack. Yet another woman described how her five-year-old daughter's head was shattered by shrapnel after their house was hit by an apparent rocket-propelled grenade. One man, who had recently returned to Sukudu village from a refugee camp in Guinea, was shot by the CDF in another attack on July 11.   A local CDF commander in Kono District, interviewed by Human Rights Watch on July 17, admitted to attacking Yiraia, the home and base of a prominent RUF member, in retaliation for previous attacks by the RUF against their positions. However, CDF leaders in Freetown denied having ordered the attack and said that at the time of the June attack, the CDF militiamen were not acting under orders from the Ministry of Defense.   In apparent retaliatory raids, which began in late June, RUF rebels attacked several towns including Porpon, Hermakono, Bumbanja, Dombadu and Samadu. During these attacks, the rebels killed at least three children, hacked off the ear of one man, wounded several more with machetes, and abducted at least sixteen people, including five children.   According to witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch, many villages have been burned and looted by both sides, and hundreds of civilians have been displaced as a result of the attacks, which took place from mid-June through the second week in July.   Witnesses claim many of the CDF militiamen currently moving into and launching attacks against RUF territory in Kono and Koinadugu Districts were, until April 2001, based in refugee camps in Guinea or around the Guinean border with Sierra Leone. While in late May 2001 the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL) was able to facilitate the disarmament of 171 of these militiamen, hundreds more are currently operating in what has been an RUF stronghold since 1998.   Human Rights Watch is concerned that hundreds of refugees who have been returning to their villages in Kono and Koinadugu Districts from refugee camps in Guinea are at particular risk for retaliatory attacks by the RUF who may accuse them of supporting the CDF militiamen.   Since a ceasefire between the RUF and Government of Sierra Leone was declared in November 2000, UNAMSIL has been able to deploy and/or patrol in all RUF-controlled areas, and since May 2001, some 7,000 combatants from all sides have disarmed. While thousands of combatants in the RUF strongholds of Kambia and Lunsar have disarmed and some degree of governmental authority has been restored, those combatants in the diamond rich area of Kono have been reluctant to disarm, frustrating United Nations and government officials.   Human Rights Watch called on UNAMSIL to hasten its planned deployment into the Kono and Koinadugu Districts so as to enhance protection of the civilian population. Human Rights Watch also called on the UNAMSIL human rights unit to make public its investigation into the attack on Yiraia, and to conduct further investigations into subsequent attacks by both the CDF and RUF against civilians in Kono and Koinadugu districts.","Africa, Sierra Leone","International Justice, Torture, United Nations"

In a 41-page memorandum, the group criticized the Greek government for punishing victims while their traffickers enjoy impunity. Trafficking victims are often apprehended by the police, detained, and deported without getting justice for the abuses they suffered while traffickers and their accomplices are rarely held accountable, the memorandum said.  """"Trafficking victims in Greece are treated like criminals,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Meanwhile, the real criminals are going free. The Greek government's response to this issue punishes the wrong people.""""  The memorandum comes on the heels of a U.S. State Department report released on July 12 that gave Greece the lowest rating possible-along with Burma, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Turkey-for failing to combat trafficking, protect victims, or even acknowledge publicly that trafficking in Greece is a problem. The United Nations and various European institutions have also criticized Greece for inaction on the trafficking of women for forced prostitution.  Human Rights Watch's specific concerns include:  · the absence in Greece of comprehensive anti-trafficking legislation;  · few prosecutions for trafficking under existing criminal laws;  · the lack of witness protection programs for trafficking victims to facilitate their participation in prosecutions;  · the absence of government-sponsored services for all trafficked women, including shelter, medical care, psychological support, and assistance with other basic needs; · the on-going detention and prosecution of trafficking victims;  · and the continuing complicity of police officers in the trafficking of women.  In May, the Greek government established a working group to develop a national action plan on trafficking. The working group is required to complete its work in one year. Human Rights Watch welcomed the initiative but stressed that many of its recommendations can and should be taken immediately.  """"The Greek government has done so little to combat trafficking that urgent measures are required now,"""" said Andersen. """"Trafficking victims cannot wait another year for justice.""""  The memorandum contains detailed short- and long-term recommendations that should be implemented by Greece to meet its obligations and commitments under international and European law.

Early Monday morning, Jakarta time, the president issued a decree """"freezing"""" the two houses of parliament, calling for an election within one year, and freezing the former ruling party, Golkar while waiting for a decision from the Supreme Court on the matter. No special powers were granted to the security forces, a usual feature of states of emergency, and the word """"emergency"""" appears nowhere in the decree. President Wahid has, however, moved Indonesia into uncharted legal territory. There is no legal definition of """"freezing"""" - it seems to be something short of dissolution - and little constitutional guidance on what steps the president can take against parliament. The 1945 constitution makes the president subordinate to the People's Consultative Assembly, the upper house of parliament, that appoints him, and many constitutional scholars believe he has no powers to dissolve either the upper or the lower house.  The president, in issuing this decree, risks contravening two key provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. By unilaterally """"freezing"""" Golkar, a legitimate political party whatever its links to the authoritarian past, President Wahid is violating the fundamental right to freedom of association. By moving against a parliament freely elected in 1999, the president may be violating the right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country.  """"Whatever the motivation for these actions, the content of today's decree is chilling,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The answer to political impasse should not be a return to authoritarian methods.""""  She noted that many civil society organizations were backing Wahid and appeared with him at the presidential palace when he made his early morning statement. They see him as a better alternative than his army-backed vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, who would take over if Wahid were forced out. They see Wahid's political enemies in parliament as being too close to the former Soeharto administration. And they believe that it should be the Indonesian people who decide the fate of their president.  Wahid's actions could set up a confrontation between the army and the president, in which the president would have few backers, or between the army and thousands of protestors in the street, if Wahid supporters go for mass mobilization in a last-ditch effort to keep him in power.  """"Either way, the army could emerge strengthened,"""" said Jones. """"The spectacularly poor performance of civilian politicians, legislators and president alike, is producing the very result that everyone wanted to avoid.""""  The political crisis in Indonesia has its roots in a power struggle between the parliament and the president. The upper house of parliament chose Abdurrahman Wahid as a compromise for president in October 1999, despite the fact that his party had secured less than ten percent of the vote in the June 1999 elections. Wahid proceeded to alienate his backers by failing to distribute cabinet posts as expected and by failing to consult with parliamentary leaders on policy.  In January 2001, the parliament moved to censure him for involvement in two financial scandals, but the Attorney General's office later ruled that there was no legal basis for charging the president. The parliament continued with its censure procedures, however, on different grounds. The president is correct in questioning the dubious constitutional basis of the parliament's actions, but the president's own actions are on shaky legal ground. Indonesia has no provision in its constitution for the Supreme Court resolving disputes over interpretation by other branches of government.","Asia, Indonesia",""

On July 22, Human Rights Watch received a two-page response to its July 10 letter to Manuel Marulanda, the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP). The FARC-EP response does not attempt to defend the FARC-EP's record on the merits. Instead, the response, which includes a number of misstatements, simply impugns Human Rights Watch's motives for criticizing FARC abuses. """"Commander Marulanda has failed to address a single one of the concerns we raised,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Instead of taking our criticisms seriously, he's issued a harangue that distracts attention from the real issues. Once again, I invite the FARC-EP leadership to remedy the damage their forces do in Colombia by ensuring that these forces respect international humanitarian law."""" In its twenty-page letter, Human Rights Watch described the FARC-EP's responsibility for serious abuses, including killings of civilians, hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, grossly unfair trials, the cruel and inhuman treatment of captured combatants, the forced displacement of civilians, and the continuing use of prohibited weapons, including gas cylinder bombs. Human Rights Watch's letter also noted that the FARC-EP has committed abductions and extrajudicial executions in the zone ceded to its control for talks with the government (zona de despeje). Human Rights Watch did not, however, call for the abrogation of the Zone, as the FARC-EP's response wrongly asserts. The Colombian government granted the Switzerland-sized area to the FARC-EP in November 1998 to further peace talks. Human Rights Watch conducted a mission to the Zone in May and June of 2000. There, Human Rights Watch held meetings with several high-level FARC-EP commanders who disputed the applicability of international humanitarian law principles to the conduct of the FARC-EP. In its letter to Marulanda, Human Rights Watch explained that the relevant international norms are not subject to negotiation, but must be upheld by each of the parties to the armed conflict in Colombia. Human Rights Watch has been publishing reports on human rights conditions in Colombia since 1982, criticizing abuses committed by all parties to the conflict. To maintain its independence, Human Rights Watch does not accept financial support from any government or government-funded agency. Contrary to the FARC-EP's statements, Human Rights Watch has actively criticized U.S. government abuses, both domestically and internationally. Besides publishing numerous reports on police brutality, prison conditions, immigrant rights and the death penalty in the United States, Human Rights Watch also reported on U.S. abuses during the Gulf War, and on NATO's violations of the laws of war during the conflict in Yugoslavia.","Americas, Colombia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/19/small-arms-campaign-obstacles-progress","Small Arms Campaign - Obstacles to Progress","Small Arms Campaign - Obstacles to Progress","","07/19/2001","The Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in all its Aspects represents a crucial opportunity to address the urgent problem of the spread and abuse of small arms and light weapons, the weapons of choice for forces that have consistently abused human rights and violated international humanitarian law in conflicts around the world.   Human Rights Watch has documented the conduct of well-armed abusive forces in Afghanistan, Angola, Burundi, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Sudan, among others, and has exposed the channels through which arms are funneled to areas of armed conflict, as well as states responsible for exports to abusive forces, including Bulgaria and South Africa, among others.    After years of neglect, U.N. and other multilateral efforts by U.N. member states have helped put small arms on the international agenda. These initiatives have been complemented by the work of nongovernmental organizations to highlight the human rights dangers posed by unregulated and unrestricted small arms flows.    The Conference will focus on the """"illicit"""" aspect of the small arms trade. But participants must recognize that many illegal weapons currently in circulation were at one point legally transferred by governments or with government approval. In addition, governments have failed to rein in private traffickers.    Thus Human Rights Watch holds that it is governments' responsibility to help solve a problem that governments have largely helped create. They should do so by developing binding norms and implementing measures to halt flows of arms, especially small arms and light weapons, to human rights abusers. It is also imperative that governments muster the political will and bolster their ability to bring to justice those who by misusing small arms, or facilitating their illicit flows, have been either instrumental in perpetrating human rights abuses or have acted in contempt of international humanitarian law.    Human Rights Watch urges that the Conference set in motion actions by U.N. member states to negotiate and approve binding norms and the implementation of measures to stop weapons from winding up in the hands of human rights abusers. Three priority areas demand early action:    1. Develop and enact binding national or regional codes of conduct on arms transfers.    Codes of conduct lay out criteria for the approval of weapons transfers, and as such introduce explicit human rights considerations into governments' weapons export decisions. To date, some of the world's major weapons suppliers have adopted codes of conduct.    The Conference cannot ignore the cardinal principle of self?restraint embodied by codes of conduct and also advocated by the U.N. group of experts on small arms. The line between the illicit and legal trade is often murky or deliberately blurred, as occurs with covert transfers.    The Conference should therefore strongly encourage U.N. member states to develop binding codes of conduct at the national or regional level, with a view toward eventually negotiating an international code of conduct on arms transfers. Human Rights Watch believes that all such codes should include at a minimum the prohibition of arms transfers to governments and non-state actors that:    gravely or systematically violate human rights or international humanitarian law;   fail to prosecute and bring to justice those responsible for such violations;  do not include as part of the training of their armed forces, paramilitary forces, and the police and other law enforcement agencies the instruction that members of such forces have the duty to refuse orders to commit human rights abuses;  do not provide access on a regular basis to humanitarian international and nongovernmental organizations in times of conflict or humanitarian emergency, and do not grant access to human rights monitors at all times;  violate international arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers;  or are not actively engaged in the creation of national and regional registers for small arms (see below).    Furthermore, the Conference should urge U.N. member states to incorporate these criteria into national legislation and report annually on their implementation to the U.N. General Assembly.    2. Increase transparency in arms transfers through reporting and the creation of registers.    Currently small arms transfers are not reported to the U.N. Register of Conventional Arms. A lack of data on small arms movements hampers efforts to track the flow of such weapons, monitor possible diversions, and sound early warnings. Therefore, states should compile and make public annual reports on the import and export of small arms, as well as their procurement by government agencies from domestic manufacturers.    These reports should provide information on both government-to-government and commercial arms transfers and list the following:    destination;   quantities and types of weapons transferred;   export/import approvals and actual deliveries;   parties involved; and   reasons for rejecting a transaction (e.g., human rights record of recipient).    An appendix to the annual report should include a list of parties that have been prohibited from engaging in arms transfers, and parties that have been found guilty of violations of national trade laws, international arms embargoes, or unauthorized arms diversions or re-exports.    Annual reports should be consolidated in regional reports with a view to creating regional registers of small arms and, eventually, a U.N. register.    3. Implement and enforce arms embargoes.    The Conference should urgently address the problem of implementing, monitoring, and punishing violators of international arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers by the U.N. or regional bodies.    As long as embargoes remain unimplemented and their violators enjoy impunity, they have the potential of doing more harm than good. They make a mockery of the international community's will and the failure to enforce them fosters the undesirable """"side effect"""" of an illicit arms trade. To avoid such outcomes, U.N. member states should agree at the Conference to:    Incorporate international arms embargoes into national legislation and adopt measures to accelerate this process;   Prosecute violators who supply or aid in the supply of weapons to embargoed states and non-state actors;   Adopt legislation that would allow the prosecution of offenders even if the violation has been committed on foreign soil;   Prosecute violations of international embargoes committed by one=s nationals or residents even when such violations occur outside national borders;   Create embargo oversight bodies to coordinate action with all pertinent government departments and collect information from all available sources;   Provide funding and expertise for the creation of a new Arms Embargo Unit within the U.N. to monitor the implementation of international arms embargoes, in consultation with the U.N. sanctions committees; and   Follow up and further elaborate the recent initiatives undertaken by the Security Council panels on Angola and Sierra Leone, as well as by the Security Council Working Group on Sanctions, and the recently completed so-called Bonn/Berlin process.    Cooperation with NGOs    Human Rights Watch also calls on Conference participants to consult and work with nongovernmental organizations, in particular with the members of the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), a worldwide coalition whose aim is to curb the proliferation and misuse of small arms, and which includes Human Rights Watch. Tapping into broad segments of civil society and giving voice to the victims of human rights abuses will ensure a grounded and comprehensive outcome for the Conference.","","Arms, United Nations"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/19/approach-reparations","An Approach to Reparations","An Approach to Reparations","","07/19/2001","Human Rights Watch traditionally advocates reparations as part of the remedy for any serious human rights abuse. For example, under traditional human rights law and policy, we expect governments that practice or tolerate racial discrimination to acknowledge and end this human rights violation and compensate the victims. However, the U.N. World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia, and Related Intolerance to be held in Durban, South Africa from August 31 to September 7, 2001, is likely to address a more complex reparations issue. It will ask whether, and if so how, reparations should be provided to people who may not have been the direct victims of racial discrimination but whose ancestors suffered such discrimination, particularly in the severe forms of slavery, the slave trade, certain especially racist aspects of colonialism, and other extreme official racist practices. This paper is Human Rights Watch's contribution to this debate. It is not a maximalist position but, rather, one that we hope will point the way to possible consensus on this contentious issue. We begin with the premise that slavery, the slave trade, the most severe forms of racism associated with colonialism, and subsequent official racist practices such as apartheid in South Africa or the Jim Crow laws in the United States are extraordinarily serious human rights violations. If committed today these would be crimes against humanity. Under traditional and straightforward human rights law and policy, each living victim of these practices is entitled individually to seek and receive reparations from those who committed or permitted these wrongs. By """"reparations"""" we mean not only compensation but also acknowledgment of past abuses, an end to ongoing abuses, and, as much as possible, restoration of the state of affairs that would have prevailed had there been no abuses. In principle, we believe that the descendants of a victim of human rights abuse should also be able to pursue claims of reparations. That is, the right to reparations should not be extinguished with the death of the victim but can be pursued by his or her heirs. However, there are practical limits to how long, or through how many generations, such claims should survive. Because human history is filled with wrongs, many of which amount to severe human rights abuse, significant practical problems arise once a certain time has elapsed in building a theory of reparations on claims of descendancy alone. If one goes back far enough, most everyone could make a case of some sort for reparations, trivializing the concept. Moreover, the older a wrong, the less the residents of countries called on to provide reparations will feel an obligation to make amends. For these practical reasons, when addressing relatively old wrongs, we would not base claims of reparations on the past abuse itself but on its contemporary effects. That is, we would focus on people who can reasonably claim that today they personally suffer the effects of past human rights violations through continuing economic or social deprivation. A group's ability to identify a wrong to its ancestors would not in itself be enough to claim reparations (although under traditional human rights law its members could pursue claims for abuses against themselves). The group would also have to show continuing harm to itself from those past abuses. This focus on contemporary effects, in our view, provides a firmer and more appealing moral footing for discussions about reparations for old abuses. It would not deliver what might look like windfalls to people who assert vicarious claims to reparations but have suffered no harm themselves. Instead, this approach concentrates on those people who continue to be victimized by past wrongs and seeks to end their victimization. Both types of reparations can be important. But given the difficulty of mobilizing resources to redress racial injustice against victims of the past, redressing the contemporary impact of past wrongs should, in our view, be the higher priority. We recognize that it is no easy matter to trace the contemporary effects of abuses that may have been committed a century or more ago. We propose, as a first step, the establishment of national and international panels to examine racist practices. These would include national panels on specific multiracial countries such as the United States, Brazil, and South Africa. (1) It would also include one or more international panels to look at the effect of the slave trade, as well as panels for specific countries that would examine the degree to which the slave trade and colonialism, as opposed to the subsequent practices of the post-independence government, have contributed to the destitution of the country's population. These panels would focus on tracing these effects not for particular individuals but for groups. For example, upon a factual showing which we assume could be made, we would accept that most African-Americans continue to suffer the effects of slavery in the United States, or that most Congolese continue to suffer the effects of Belgian colonization. Difficult as it inevitably would be, the panels examining colonized countries should also determine the extent to which the post-independence governments' human rights abuses have contributed to the continuing social and economic marginalization of their populations, because external governments should be held responsible only for deprivation due to their own conduct. The panels should be chosen in a way that maximizes their credibility - again, not a simple task. They should be transparent - open as much as possible to public scrutiny and participation. Effectively truth commissions, they should draw on all available sources, from work done by historians to testimony from sociologists and economists to the views of the victim communities. In our view, these panels would serve critical functions quite apart from their role in trying to quantify the cost of remedying the continuing impact of past racist practices. They should aim to reveal the extent to which a government's past racist practices contribute to contemporary economic and social deprivation, educate the public about this continuing effect, acknowledge responsibility for it, and propose methods for rectifying these effects and making amends. If desired, they could also address current or recent racist practices. For example, these panels would be an ideal vehicle for governments to acknowledge the harm that their past severe racist practices caused and continue to cause. Even insofar as these effects are widely known, it is important to keep in mind the well known distinction between """"knowledge"""" and """"acknowledgment"""" - everyone may """"know"""" about a government's abuses, but the government's formal """"acknowledgment"""" of the abuses is a critical part of repair. These panels would enable governments not only to acknowledge the persistent harm caused by their past abuses but also to vow to take steps to end that harm. Any estimate of the cost of overcoming the contemporary impact of past racist practices will necessarily be inexact. Certainly pledges of money to remedy that impact will be welcome. But more important than a particular financial pledge will be a political pledge to remedy the continuing effects. In our view, governments should not be permitted to use pledges of financial assistance (inevitably insufficient) to buy their way out of reparations claims without first allowing this truth telling to proceed and then making a political commitment to remedy the harms found, since over the long term this truth telling and political commitment are more likely to generate the sustained investment needed to remedy these ongoing effects than one-shot, out-of-context pledges of compensation. Moreover, government acknowledgment of the degree to which past racist practices continue to victimize certain populations would set a standard - a public benchmark - to assess progress toward remedying these effects. We recognize that these panels would be double-edged in a way that might not be terribly appealing to some of the governments currently advocating reparations. Implicit in determining the extent to which past racist practices underlie current deprivation is a determination of the extent to which such deprivation is due to other factors - an apportionment of blame. In many countries, one major factor behind current deprivation is the despotic and unenlightened rule of national leaders. These leaders, insofar as they are still in power, may well find this spotlight uncomfortable. We would resist efforts to focus this causal inquiry too narrowly, since we have no interest in letting these leaders off the hook. How would one determine which groups continue to suffer from past racist practices sufficiently to warrant reparations, and how much are they owed? We believe a human rights perspective can be useful in answering these questions. On the theory that the primary concern should be people whose social and economic deprivation is greatest (at least, for these purposes, insofar as that deprivation is attributable to severe racial injustice committed against their forebears), we would focus reparations on those whose economic and social rights continue to be violated. The remedy to which they should be entitled would be an end to this violation of their economic and social rights - again, for these purposes, at least insofar as this violation can be shown to derive from past racist practices. We see several advantages to discussing reparations claims in terms of the impact of past racist practices on contemporary respect for economic and social rights: Ø First, given that the resources available for reparations are inevitably limited, we would focus as a matter of priority on those in greatest need today. Wealthier individuals and groups may well be able to show that their ancestors suffered because of slavery or the most racist aspects of colonialism. They may even be able to demonstrate that their own contemporary prospects are limited to some extent by the continuing effects of these abuses. But because their wealth suggests that they have substantially surmounted this legacy, we would not make them the focus of a reparations scheme. An approach based on economic and social rights shifts the focus to those most in need. Ø Second, a focus on economic and social rights provides greater urgency than traditional reparations claims, because it asks us to rectify today's injustices rather than yesterday's. We would expect the public to be more receptive to ending a contemporary wrong connected to a historical injustice than to providing compensation for the past injustice standing alone. Ø Third, a focus on economic and social rights provides a more concrete benchmark for measuring the appropriate magnitude of reparations. The purpose of the amount sought would not be to rectify an intangible past harm but to redress a quite tangible contemporary harm - again, at least insofar as it was caused by past racial injustice. Ø Fourth, an approach based on economic and social rights would allow reparations schemes to reinforce solutions to the world's most acute development challenges rather than setting up competition for limited funds from claimants who may not correspond with those most in need. The purpose of reparations payments would not be simply to hand over sums of money to the descendants of past victims, but to rectify the social and economic processes that underlie today's victims' continuing marginalization. Thus, reparations payments would presumably be used for investment in education, housing, health care, or job training, rather than consumer goods or other ephemeral benefits. Ø Fifth, the """"progressive realization"""" standard inherent in an approach based on economic and social rights has the flexibility needed to address reparations demands in societies at various levels of development. (2) In a wealthy country like the United States, relative deprivation could be the focus - rectifying the continuing inferior investment in, for example, schools, housing, and medical care serving much of the black population. (The same could be said for Native Americans and other similarly situated victim groups.) In impoverished countries, the aim would probably have to be more modest - raising people to a subsistence level, as defined by the U.N. Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. Ø Sixth, a focus on economic and social rights highlights the need for reparations schemes to supplement affirmative action with broader social investments aimed at benefiting entire disadvantaged groups, not just their most successful members. Affirmative action is certainly one useful remedial tool. But in practice affirmative action tends to favor those members of a disadvantaged group who are relatively advantaged and in the best position to benefit from the extra opportunities provided. An approach based on economic and social rights would insist on broader social investment to lift from extreme poverty even the least advantaged members of a disadvantaged group. Ø Seventh, this approach would help avoid a problem of intergenerational justice. If reparations are made in the form of payments to individuals rather than investment in the economic and social dynamics behind continuing marginalization, that would raise questions about why today's generation should be seen as more deserving of these payments than tomorrow's generation or the next. Such payments would unjustifiably privilege today's descendants while leaving later generations suffering from the same racism-induced deprivation. By contrast, reparations aimed at redressing the economic and social dynamics behind systemic impoverishment would improve the lot of both today's and subsequent generations and, if successful, end continuing victimization. We recognize that there is a certain legal redundancy in translating the duty to make reparations for past racist practices into a duty to uphold economic and social rights. After all, there is already a duty to uphold economic and social rights, as codified in the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights. However, in our view, there is something to be gained from speaking of this same duty as arising not only from the ICESCR but also from the distinct obligation to remedy past racist practices. That is, we would provide another reason for doing the right thing. This is particularly important for claims of reparations across international frontiers, since a government's duty to respect ICESCR obligations has always been understood as stronger within its borders than in its relations with other states. Despite the legal obligation articulated in the ICESCR, we must recognize that governments are extraordinarily reluctant to meet their financial responsibilities - especially, as noted, though by no means exclusively, when it comes to providing aid to other countries. Demonstrating that economic and social deprivation is due, at least in part, to state-sponsored or state-tolerated racism should help to reinforce a public sense of responsibility for realizing economic and social rights, since it would demonstrate an important way in which officially sanctioned policies have created and maintained poverty. By transforming what is so often seen mainly as a matter of largesse into an obligation for past misconduct, this approach to reparations should enhance (not merely restate) today's meager commitment to helping those around the world who are most in need. By highlighting the structural dimension to racial marginalization, it also helps the public understand the limits to """"equal treatment"""" or """"non-discrimination"""" approaches to racial problems and the need in some cases to invest in more fundamental and structural solutions. However, it is important to note that providing another reason to respect the rights contained in the ICESCR is not a matter of playing favorites among victims. We seek to uphold everyone's economic and social rights. This reparations policy would simply provide an additional reason to uphold the rights of certain victims. It should not be taken to prioritize those victims over others in comparable need. Once the appropriate beneficiaries of reparations can be identified, it is still necessary to determine who should pay the financial component. People today will ask why they should be held responsible for the crimes of their ancestors. That is why we would focus on the responsibility of governments. A government that sponsored or permitted slavery, the slave trade, or other severe racist practices should not, in our view, be allowed to avoid responsibility simply because of the passage of time. (3) However, even though governments have an intergenerational life, we recognize that to hold them responsible for past crimes is, as a practical matter, to hold today's citizens or taxpayers responsible. We believe this attribution of responsibility can be justified by reference to the economic benefits that these countries derived from, say, slavery or abusive colonialism - benefits that presumably helped to jumpstart their industrialization and thus continue to the present. We note that this rationale would apply even to immigrants who arrived in a beneficiary country after these abusive practices ended, since they, too, presumably have benefited from the advanced economy they joined. There remain questions about the mechanics of such an approach. Reparations can obviously take several forms. One approach would be to establish trust funds on a country-by-country basis to receive payments. The trust funds should be charged with remedying the worst local violations of economic and social rights. Trustees should be chosen fairly to represent the population most in need. Governments, both domestic and foreign, found responsible for past racist practices with ongoing effects would be expected to make financial pledges, ideally commensurate with their degree of responsibility, to each relevant trust fund. Payments presumably would be pledged over several years. When international payments are involved, some degree of international supervision might be maintained, perhaps through the United Nations. Reparations could also be made in other forms. For example, at the international level, a useful model is the one adopted by the international financial institutions for debt relief. This model imposes strict reporting and transparency requirements in an effort to channel the benefits of debt relief to those most in need. A comparable procedure could be used if a government found to have the requisite responsibility chooses to fulfill its obligation through debt relief rather than cash payments. Similarly, reparations could presumably be made, at least in part, by reducing tariffs or increasing import quotas, with appropriate guarantees that the benefits inure foremost to those most in need. Finally, financial compensation in whatever form should be only one aspect of a broader approach to reparations. Because the authors of many of the most severe racist practices of recent history are dead, criminal prosecutions will usually not be a meaningful option. However, as noted, the panels to identify the contemporary effects of past racist practices should also serve as a vehicle for governmental acknowledgment that these wrongs were done and governmental vows to end any persistent racist practices and to avoid repetition of such abuses in the future. (Once more, payments should not be allowed to replace these non-financial aspects of reparations.) Similarly, we would encourage the establishment of monuments or museums as a way of paying respect to the victims of past abuses, educating the public about what was done, and building a public morality dedicated to avoiding repetition of these offenses. Finally, the reparations debate should be an occasion to examine and change institutions, such as the criminal justice system in the United States, that arguably extend the effects of past racist practices through their disproportionately negative impact on racial minorities. (4) Human Rights Watch welcomes further discussion of these important issues. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1. We cite here three countries with a history of discrimination against persons of African descent which have been the focus of the reparations debate so far. But this principle clearly could and should apply to other victims of severe forms of racism and intolerance as well - for example, the Roma of Europe. In appropriate cases, it could also apply to severe forms of gender discrimination, and, in any event, the gender component should always be kept in mind when analyzing racial and other types of discrimination in order to appreciate their full effect. 2. Article 2(1) of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights provides: """"Each State Party of the present Covenant undertakes to take steps, individually and through international assistance and cooperation, especially economic and technical, to the maximum extent of its available resources, with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present Covenant by all appropriate means, including particularly the adoption of legislative measures."""" 3. Human Rights Watch recognizes that a different resolution may be appropriate for private corporations that were complicit in past severe racial discrimination. 4.

The conference, which concludes in New York on July 20, has not addressed state responsibility for weapons proliferation and has focused too much on the illegal trafficking of small arms, Human Rights Watch said. Many delegates have tried to single out shadowy gunrunners as the chief culprits, while neglecting the governmental role in supplying the weapons used to commit atrocities.  The United States, exhibiting a strong isolationist strain, has joined states such as Russia and China with a longstanding hostility toward global regulatory agreements, and together they are threatening to produce a watered-down """"Program of Action,"""" Human Rights Watch said. In the final two days of the conference, a struggle over the program could still prompt a walkout by either supporters or opponents of a stronger commitment to curb weapons flows.  """"This conference is set to produce a 'Program of Inaction,'"""" said Joost Hiltermann, executive director of the Arms Division at Human Right Watch. """"It has helped raise public awareness of the spread of small arms. But it hasn't put forward a serious plan for stopping this terrible human rights problem.""""  A coalition of humanitarian and human rights groups has vowed to keep up the pressure on governments to stem the trade in small arms, and to refocus the debate on the human cost of uncontrolled weapons proliferation.  States should take responsibility for stopping the spread of small arms by strengthening arms trade controls to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers, enforcing those controls better, reining in private traffickers, doing more to secure arms stockpiles, and disposing responsibly of vast quantities of cheap surplus weapons.  Hiltermann said the United States had missed an opportunity to promote its own record on arms trade controls, which are relatively stringent.  """"The U.S. government seems to have concluded that it wants no entanglements in international treaties,"""" said Hiltermann. """"It's tragic that Washington has not used its powers for good in this case. To the contrary, it has been an obstacle to progress, doing all that it can to keep civil society out of the debate.""""  Instead of addressing the governmental role in the arms trade, the conference sought technical fixes, such as marking weapons and improving border policing, which are aimed exclusively at illicit arms traffickers.  Worst of all, Human Rights Watch said, the """"Program of Action"""" is non-binding and unlikely to establish a follow-up process that would hold governments to even their rhetorical commitments.  Human Rights Watch said the conference should have adopted a clear standard: that no government should authorize any transfer of arms to a state or non-state actor as long as there is a clear risk that these arms will be used by the likely recipient to commit gross human rights abuses, war crimes, or crimes against humanity.","Global","Arms"

Letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon Brussels, July 19, 2001 His Excellency Ariel Sharon Prime Minister Israel  Dear Prime Minister Sharon,  Human Rights Watch is writing with regard to the appointment of Carmi Gillon as Israel's new ambassador to Denmark. This is Mr. Gillon's first diplomatic posting, and it follows a career with Israel's General Security Services (GSS), the body responsible for conducting interrogations of persons detained by Israel on security-related charges. From 1988 to 1996, he held high-ranking positions within the agency. Extensive and well-documented allegations of torture or ill-treatment have been made against the GSS, including during the 1993-1996 period, when Mr. Gillon was head of GSS Headquarters and subsequently of the entire GSS operation. In the light of Mr. Gillon's professional history, your nomination of him to serve as ambassador is highly inappropriate, and we urge you to withdraw his appointment without delay.  Since his appointment, in a number of interviews with Danish media, Mr. Gillon has spoken approvingly of the policies of """"moderate physical pressure"""" that the GSS has routinely applied in its interrogation sessions, referring to techniques such as violent shaking and prolonged position abuse that virtually all other states and international human rights bodies have condemned as amounting to torture or ill-treatment. He further suggested that, following an Israeli high court ruling of September 1999 that such practices were not sanctioned by law, legislation should be passed to authorize those practices. In an interview in Jyllands Posten of July 9, he stated that he was himself directly implicated in about one hundred such cases.  Mr. Gillon's official biography notes that from 1972 to 1988 he held """"various professional duties and field command positions"""" in the GSS. From 1988 to 1990, he was head of the GSS Training Branch, and from 1990 to 1993 he served as head of the Northern Region Branch. In 1993 he became chief of the Headquarters Branch, and in 1995 he was named overall head of the GSS. His official service with the organization ended in 1996.  Torture during interrogation of Palestinian security suspects has been a major issue in Israel for many years, and notably throughout the period when Mr. Gillon occupied high positions in the agency. In 1987, as a result of a series of scandals associated with torture of Palestinian suspects in detention, a Commission of Inquiry headed by then-Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau concluded that """"exertion of a moderate measure of physical pressure"""" should be allowed in interrogations. In contrast to the prevailing situation, this """"moderate physical pressure"""" should have """"clear boundaries,"""" which were detailed in an annex to the report that still remains secret. The guidelines reportedly included severe shaking, shackling detainees in painful positions for prolonged periods, sleep and sensory deprivation, exposure to temperature extremes, and psychological pressures. The Landau Commission also set up a ministerial review committee to review the guidelines periodically, and called for the State Comptroller to assume responsibility for investigating complaints of abuse.  Numerous Israeli and international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, maintained that the """"moderate physical pressure"""" allowed by the Landau Commission constituted torture as defined in the Convention against Torture, which Israel ratified in 1991. The Convention categorically prohibits any use of torture under any circumstances. The United Nations Committee against Torture, which reviews the reports and practices of states parties to the Convention, concluded in April 1994 that """"'moderate physical pressure' as a lawful mode of interrogation is completely unacceptable to this Committee.""""  Torture is further considered a """"grave breach"""" of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In May 1992 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took the unusual step of stating publicly that """"means of physical and psychological pressure are being used that constitute a violation of the Convention,"""" and deeply regretted that its reports and presentations on this subject at high levels """"have been to no avail.""""  Controversies over Israel's routine use of torture in interrogation were heightened by widespread reports and official findings that the Landau Commission's guidelines were being extensively breached, a fact concerning which Mr. Gillon must have been aware. A May 1991 investigation into violence in military interrogation centers, headed by Maj. Gen. Rafael Vardi, recommended transferring the interrogation mandate from the military (Israel Defense Force, IDF), """"which was not meant to interrogate civilians."""" An investigation by the Ministry of Justice into GSS interrogation practices, also in May 1991, reportedly found extensive """"deviations"""" from the Landau Commission guidelines. An audit of GSS practices by the State Comptroller, covering the 1988-1992 period-i.e., the years of the first intifada-also found extensive """"deviations"""" from the Landau recommendations and GSS regulations, especially in Gaza but in other facilities as well. The Comptroller concluded that these violations did not stem from ignorance of those rules and regulations: the """"deviations"""" were committed by """"veteran interrogators"""" on a serious and systematic basis. (The Comptroller's audit was submitted to the Knesset Subcommittee on Intelligence Services in 1995; a summary was made public only in January 2000, following the September 1999 High Court ruling outlawing the Landau Commission rules.)  According to Israeli press reports, citing the State Attorney, the GSS interrogated some 23,000 Palestinians between 1987 and 1994. Investigations by international and Israeli human rights organizations have found that, in the words of a 1997 report by B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, """"it is very rare indeed that the GSS interrogates Palestinians without using at least some of the [""""moderate physical pressures""""] methods…."""" The report went on to cite a 1995 remark of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who said that violent shaking had been used against 8,000 detainees.  In June 1994, a Human Rights Watch investigation into Israel's use of torture during interrogation of Palestinians confirmed that the GSS, with ten interrogation centers, was the agency primarily responsible for interrogation of security suspects. """"In general the GSS decides who does the interrogation,"""" an official in the IDF Judge Advocate General's office told us. We concluded that the GSS used beatings less than the IDF during interrogations, and relied more on position abuse and sensory deprivation. """"Within one or two days of their arrest, persons taken to GSS interrogation wings are placed in a universe of discomfort, pain, humiliation and threats,"""" the report stated. We noted that """"[a]t all stages of GSS interrogations, the methods of torture and ill-treatment tend to follow a well-defined set of steps and guidelines. Interrogation methods are selected to inflict extreme physical pain and mental anguish without causing lasting or traceable physical injury."""" Our investigation also found that torture and abuse were more the rule than the exception, and that tens of thousands of Palestinians had suffered abuse at the hands of GSS and the IDF. Many of those in the sample we interviewed had eventually been released without charges ever having been brought against them, a finding confirmed by other international and Israeli human rights organizations and one suggesting that the """"ticking bomb"""" or """"necessity"""" argument accounted for very few of the cases where torture and ill-treatment were employed.  These practices were ongoing and a matter of high public controversy during the period when Mr. Gillon occupied high-level positions in the GSS.  · B'Tselem documented nine cases of torture and ill-treatment in the May-August period of 1994, at a time when Mr. Gillon was chief of the GSS's Headquarters Branch.  · In April 1995, Abd al-Samad Harizat died in Jerusalem's Russian Compound (Moskobiyya) detention center after having been subjected by GSS agents to violent shaking, a practice sanctioned by the Landau Commission. According to an autopsy report by Israeli forensic pathologists, the specifics of his injuries """"fit with brain damage due to rotational acceleration of the head without direct injury and/or indirect injury to the head."""" At this time Mr. Gillon was the head of the GSS.  · In January 1996, at the request of the government, the High Court of Justice annulled an interim injunction it had earlier issued against further use of """"moderate physical pressures"""" against Abd al-Halim Bilbeisi. The government acknowledged or refrained from denying that these methods included: shackling in painful positions; hooding; incessant blaring music; sleep deprivation; enforced squatting; and violent shaking.  This record makes Mr. Gillon's appointment as an ambassador of the government most inappropriate. Given his prominent role in an agency that regularly used and promoted the use of measures authoritatively understood to constitute torture or ill-treatment under international human rights and humanitarian law, we strongly urge your government to withdraw his name from consideration from this or any other ambassadorial post. Mr. Gillon's record with the GSS warrants a serious impartial inquiry into the use of torture and ill-treatment by the agency during the period in which he served in responsible command and oversight positions, and an investigation into his role in ordering, sanctioning, or taking part in such abuses.

Policy towards Third Countries on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,"""" adopted by E.U. foreign ministers meeting as the General Affairs Council on April 9 of this year. These guidelines state that """"Torture and ill-treatment are among the most abhorrent violations of human rights and human dignity,"""" and note that """"impunity for the perpetrators of torture and ill-treatment continues to prevail in many countries."""" The guidelines include steps to """"combat impunity""""-steps that include """"conduct[ing] prompt, impartial and effective investigations of all allegations of torture"""" and """"bringing those responsible for torture and ill-treatment to justice.""""  We therefore urge you to review the decision to accept Mr. Gillon's credentials, and to exercise the discretion allowed by Article 9(1) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations to reverse that decision. We also urge the Foreign Ministry to review and make public the procedures by which the credentials of persons appointed as ambassadors are considered and evaluated, in order to minimize the possibility of any similar embarrassment in the future.  Mr. Gillon's career as a high-level official in the GSS, also known as the Shin Bet, or SHABAK, is a matter of record. His official biography notes that from 1972 to 1988 he held """"various professional duties and field command positions"""" in this organization. From 1988 to 1990, he was head of the GSS Training Branch, and from 1990 to 1993 he served as head of the Northern Region Branch. In 1993 he became chief of the Headquarters Branch, and in 1995 he was named overall head of the GSS. His official service with the organization ended in 1996.  Torture during interrogation of Palestinian security suspects has been a major issue in Israel for many years, and notably throughout the period when Mr. Gillon occupied high positions in the agency. In 1987, as a result of a series of scandals associated with torture of Palestinian suspects in detention, a Commission of Inquiry headed by then-Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau concluded that """"exertion of a moderate measure of physical pressure"""" should be allowed in interrogations. In contrast to the prevailing situation, this """"moderate physical pressure"""" should have """"clear boundaries,"""" which were detailed in an annex to the report that still remains secret. The guidelines reportedly included severe shaking, shackling detainees in painful positions for prolonged periods, sleep and sensory deprivation, exposure to temperature extremes, and psychological pressures. The Landau Commission also set up a ministerial review committee to review the guidelines periodically, and called for the State Comptroller to assume responsibility for investigating complaints of abuse.  Numerous Israeli and international human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, maintained that the """"moderate physical pressure"""" allowed by the Landau Commission constituted torture as defined in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which Israel ratified in 1991. The Convention categorically prohibits any use of torture under any circumstances. The United Nations Committee against Torture, which reviews the reports and practices of states parties to the Convention, concluded in April 1994 that """"'moderate physical pressure' as a lawful mode of interrogation is completely unacceptable to this Committee.""""  Torture is further considered a """"grave breach"""" of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which governs Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In May 1992 the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) took the unusual step of stating publicly that """"means of physical and psychological pressure are being used that constitute a violation of the Convention,"""" and deeply regretted that its reports and presentations on this subject at high levels """"have been to no avail.""""  Controversies over Israel's routine use of torture and ill-treatment in interrogation were heightened by widespread reports and official findings that the Landau Commission's guidelines were being extensively breached. A May 1991 investigation into violence in military interrogation centers, headed by Maj. Gen. Rafael Vardi, recommended transferring the interrogation mandate from the military (Israel Defense Force, IDF), """"which was not meant to interrogate civilians."""" An investigation by the Ministry of Justice into GSS interrogation practices, also in May 1991, reportedly found extensive """"deviations"""" from the Landau Commission guidelines. An audit of GSS practices by the State Comptroller, covering the 1988-1992 period-i.e., the years of the first intifada-also found extensive """"deviations"""" from the Landau recommendations and GSS regulations, especially in Gaza but in other facilities as well. The Comptroller concluded that these violations did not stem from ignorance of those rules and regulations: the """"deviations"""" were committed by """"veteran interrogators"""" on a serious and systematic basis. (The Comptroller's audit was submitted to the Knesset Subcommittee on Intelligence Services in 1995; a summary was made public only in January 2000, following the September 1999 High Court ruling outlawing the Landau Commission rules.)  According to Israeli press reports, citing the State Attorney, the GSS interrogated some 23,000 Palestinians between 1987 and 1994. Investigations by international and Israeli human rights organizations have found that, in the words of a 1997 report by B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, """"it is very rare indeed that the GSS interrogates Palestinians without using at least some of the [""""moderate physical pressures""""] methods…."""" The report went on to cite a 1995 remark of then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who said that violent """"shaking"""" had been used against 8,000 detainees.  In June 1994, a Human Rights Watch investigation into Israel's use of torture during interrogation of Palestinians confirmed that the GSS, with ten interrogation centers, was the agency primarily responsible for interrogation of security suspects. """"In general the GSS decides who does the interrogation,"""" an official in the IDF Judge Advocate General's office told us. We concluded that the GSS used beatings less than the IDF during interrogations, and relied more on position abuse and sensory deprivation. """"Within one or two days of their arrest, persons taken to GSS interrogation wings are placed in a universe of discomfort, pain, humiliation and threats,"""" the report stated. We noted that """"[a]t all stages of GSS interrogations, the methods of torture and ill-treatment tend to follow a well-defined set of steps and guidelines. Interrogation methods are selected to inflict extreme physical pain and mental anguish without causing lasting or traceable physical injury."""" Our investigation also found that torture and abuse were more the rule than the exception, and that tens of thousands of Palestinians had suffered abuse at the hands of GSS and the IDF. Many of those in the sample we interviewed had eventually been released without charges ever having been brought against them, a finding confirmed by other international and Israeli human rights organizations and one suggesting that the """"ticking bomb"""" or """"necessity"""" argument accounted for very few of the cases where torture and ill-treatment were employed.  These practices were ongoing and a matter of high public controversy during the period when Mr. Gillon occupied high-level positions in the GSS.  · B'Tselem documented nine cases of torture and ill-treatment in the May-August period of 1994, at a time when Mr. Gillon was chief of the GSS's Headquarters Branch.  · In April 1995, Abd al-Samad Harizat died in Jerusalem's Russian Compound (Moskobiyya) detention center after having been subjected by GSS agents to violent shaking, a practice sanctioned by the Landau Commission. According to an autopsy report by Israeli forensic pathologists, the specifics of his injuries """"fit with brain damage due to rotational acceleration of the head without direct injury and/or indirect injury to the head."""" At the time Mr. Gillon was the head of the GSS.  · In January 1996, also during Mr. Gillon's tenure as the head of the GSS, the High Court of Justice at the request of the government annulled an interim injunction it had earlier issued against further use of """"moderate physical pressures"""" against Abd al-Halim Bilbeisi. The government acknowledged or refrained from denying that these methods included: shackling in painful positions; hooding; incessant blaring music; sleep deprivation; enforced squatting; and violent shaking.  Given Mr. Gillon's prominent role in an agency that regularly used and promoted the use of measures authoritatively understood to constitute torture or ill-treatment under international human rights and humanitarian law, we strongly urge your government to exercise the discretion allowed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by revoking the diplomatic accreditation recently extended to him. To do otherwise would be to debase the E.U.'s own Guidelines, adopted this April, concerning policy towards third countries on matters of torture. It is important to send a signal to the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, which nominated Mr. Gillon as its ambassador, that Denmark will not in any way countenance a policy of torture and ill-treatment, even if that policy is couched in terms of """"moderate physical pressures.""""  Coming out of this controversy, Denmark should send one strong message: that diplomatic service should not be the source of job and travel opportunities for persons responsible for committing or sanctioning acts of torture, and that Denmark will not welcome such persons to Copenhagen's diplomatic community. It is vitally important that the European Union support Denmark fully in this matter and ensure that member states implement policies and procedures to prevent any similar abuse of the privileges of diplomatic immunity. Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the Belgian Presidency and the E.U. High Representative, Javier Solana, to take immediate steps to coordinate transparent and efficient implementation of the adopted guidelines throughout the E.U. region.

Despite the rhetoric of a “war on drugs,"""" the effort to curb narcotics trafficking is not war; it is law enforcement, and should be guided by law enforcement standards. Without a probable cause showing imminent violence, suspects cannot be fired upon as if they were combatants in armed conflict. Yet that is precisely what the Peruvian air force did, to a plane that gave no reason to suspect that it represented a threat of imminent violence, on April 20, 2001. Mere suspicion that it was engaged in narcotics trafficking should not have been enough to open fire. President George W. Bush The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500  Dear President Bush,  We understand that the Bush Administration is considering resuming joint patrols with the Peruvian air force in pursuit of aircraft that might be involved in narcotics trafficking in the Andean region. Should the U.S. resume such patrols, we strongly urge you to insist on a change in the rules of engagement that led to the tragic shooting down of an airplane transporting an American missionary family in April. We make this recommendation not simply as a matter of prudence but also to avoid U.S. complicity in conduct that is contrary to international law enforcement standards.  As you may know, international law enforcement standards strictly limit the use of lethal force against a fleeing suspect. The use of firearms is permitted only when the suspect poses an imminent threat of violence to law enforcement officials or others. The leading standard in this area is contained in the Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials, which was adopted in 1990 by the Eighth U.N. Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders. Principle 9 prohibits the use of firearms by law enforcement officials except """"in self-defense or defense of others against the imminent threat of death or serious injury"""" or a """"grave threat to life,"""" and only when """"less extreme means are insufficient."""" Mere involvement in criminal activity, or flight from apprehension, is insufficient to justify using firearms under Principle 9 unless there are facts to suggest an """"imminent threat of death or serious injury."""" Moreover, Principle 9 proscribes the intentional use of lethal force - the only fair way to characterize shooting at an aircraft - except """"when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life.""""  These international standards closely parallel U.S. domestic law. In Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled: """"Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the [arresting] officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so."""" Ibid. at 11. Although the Court suggested that this standard might be satisfied by a showing of probable cause that the suspect has already committed a crime of violence, ibid. at 11-12, it clearly is not satisfied by mere suspicion that the suspect is involved in drug trafficking.  The need for clearly stated rules of engagement is particularly important when, as in Peru, military officials have been given policing responsibilities. Despite the rhetoric of a """"war on drugs,"""" the effort to curb narcotics trafficking is not war; it is law enforcement, and should be guided by law enforcement standards. Without a probable cause showing of imminent violence, suspects cannot be fired upon as if they were combatants in armed conflict. Yet that is precisely what the Peruvian air force did, to a plane that gave no reason to suspect that it represented a threat of imminent violence. Mere suspicion that it was engaged in narcotics trafficking should not have been enough to open fire.  To avoid repetition of this tragedy, and to ensure that U.S. officials are not complicit in law enforcement activity that contravenes international standards, we urge you to insist that any aerial surveillance of suspected drug traffickers in which U.S. officials are involved refrain from using lethal force in the absence of an imminent threat of violence.

Your decision to press for changes in the Rockefeller drug laws had the welcome effect of jumpstarting the stalled reform debate in Albany. Unfortunately, the actual reforms you have proposed in the """"Felony Drug Law Reform Act"""" (FDLRA), introduced at your request in the Senate, are too few and too minor.  The FDLRA retains many of the worst features of the Rockefeller laws: it keeps a structure of mandatory prison sentences; leaves low-level nonviolent offenders vulnerable to excessive sentences; and maintains the undue power of prosecutors over sentencing and diversion decisions. It creates new offenses subject to mandatory sentence provisions and arbitrarily increases sentences for certain predicate offenders. Diversion to substance abuse treatment programs is limited and there is no provision for sentences to community-based sanctions. According to an analysis by the Legal Action Center, only a few hundred persons would become eligible for a non-incarceration sentence under your proposed reforms. It is also notable that the proposed legislation also fails to provide any increased funding for drug treatment and alternatives to incarceration programs. A more detailed critique of some of the key sentencing aspects of the FDLRA is attached.  New York needs drug sentencing legislation that will dramatically reduce the imposition of prison sentences on low-level drug offenders - whether buyers, users or sellers, whether first-time or repeat offenders. Prison should be reserved for serious, dangerous offenders. Judges and prosecutors must also be returned to their proper roles in the criminal justice system: prosecutors should seek to protect the community by securing convictions of the guilty; impartial judges should have the sole discretion to determine the punishment that fits the crime. State laws should also should encourage - and fund - the increased use of alternatives to incarceration - whether substance abuse treatment programs or community-based sanctions - for low level offenders who pose no appreciable threat to public safety. The FDLRA is so seriously flawed, in our judgment, that it should be abandoned. We urge you to work with state legislators to develop and adopt legislation that will bring to New York the sensible and fair sentencing of drug offenders that the state has long lacked.

It said the judicial proceedings against him were unfair and unwarranted from the outset. Li is expected to be deported back to the U.S. immediately “We welcome the fact that Li will be able to rejoin his family, but we deplore that the Chinese government has found a way to turn academic pursuits into criminal activities,” said Saman Zia-Zarifi, Academic Freedom Director for Human Rights Watch. “We also urge Chinese authorities to immediately and unconditionally release the other academics they have arbitrarily detained.” Li Shaomin, a U.S. citizen, went on trial Saturday. Li is among a group of Chinese scholars with ties to the West who have been arbitrarily detained in recent months. “This is hardly a celebration of the Olympic spirit,” Zia-Zarifi said. “The Chinese government should be apologizing to these scholars and their families and offering compensation for arbitrary arrest and detention.” Human Rights Watch said Li´s release is one more example of international pressure producing results, but that long-term damage to academic freedom and exchanges with China had been done. Zia-Zarifi noted that in April 2001, more than 400 China specialists around the world appealed to President Jiang Zemin to either release the detained scholars immediately or give them a chance to defend themselves in a court of law with international standards of due process. China has done neither. Among the remaining detainees are four U.S.-based individuals. They are Gao Shan, Wu Jianmin, Liu Yiaping, and Tan Guangguang (also seen as Qin Guangguang). Gao is a researcher at American University in Washington. Wu is a writer and former staff member at the Communist Party School in Beijing; Li is a businessman; and Tan is a pharmaceutical expert. They are also facing possible trials. Another scholar, Xu Zerong, has been in detention for nine months. He holds a PhD from Oxford University, where his dissertation was on the role of the People´s Liberation Army during the Korean War. The charges against him are not known, and his family has reportedly had no contact with him since his arrest. It is crucial that international pressure be maintained for the release of all five. Noting that U.S. President George Bush had personally intervened on the cases of Gao and Li, Human Rights Watch said it was important for the president to remain personally engaged on the issue of arbitrary detention in China.

""""Respect for human rights must be at the center of any effort to resolve the conflict,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The cycle of repression and violence will only escalate unless there is a commitment by all parties to end human rights violations.""""  Human Rights Watch pointed to the absence of human rights guarantees as a critical omission in the unilateral ceasefire that was declared by Prime Minister Vajpayee on November 19, 2000. The ceasefire was lifted on May 23, 2001. Shortly after the ceasefire's imposition, the state police chief in Jammu and Kashmir, A.K. Suri, announced that the ceasefire would not affect police counterinsurgency operations. Arbitrary arrests and custodial deaths continued to be widely reported while the ceasefire was operative.  The violations have been compounded by a lack of accountability for abuses committed by Indian security personnel in Kashmir. More than two months have passed since the beating of seventeen journalists by troops of the Indian Border Security Force (BSF) in Magam. The officers implicated were subsequently recalled from Kashmir, but no disciplinary action appears to have been taken against them. The assault took place on May 10, while the journalists were covering a suicide bomb attack against a BSF camp. An official inquiry was promptly conducted by BSF Inspector General (Operations) Vijay Kumar, but the resulting report has not been made public, despite requests from local journalists and journalists groups. The journalists concerned have also not been compensated for the extensive damages sustained to their photographic equipment.  Both India and Pakistan have continued to deny political rights and to restrict freedoms of expression and assembly in the sectors of Jammu and Kashmir that they respectively control. India yesterday placed Kashmiri leader Shabbir Shah under house arrest, on the eve of the summit and on the day of a procession that he planned to lead commemorating the shooting of some twenty-two unarmed Kashmiris by troops of the state's former ruler in 1931.

Since the beginning of the so-called Al Aqsa intifada in late September, Bir Zeit University has faced a military blockade that has often prevented students from attending classes and has at times shut down the university completely. The graduation ceremonies, which will take place over the next three days, have been delayed by about one month because of travel restrictions imposed by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).  Approximately fifty students from Gaza will not be able to attend those ceremonies because they are stranded in Gaza, and no longer authorized by Israel to travel to the West Bank. Meanwhile, another three hundred students from Gaza are stranded at the university and have no way to return home.  Many of these students are unable to support themselves because the Israeli military crackdown has greatly worsened economic conditions. The United Nations Development Program initiated a special emergency fund on May 1 to solicit donations from governmental and private donors that would allow Palestinian students to continue their studies.  """"The students and faculty of Bir Zeit are suffering a cruel form of collective punishment,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, director of the academic freedom program at Human Rights Watch. """"The Israeli blockade is raising tensions with the best and the brightest of Palestinian youth.""""  Bir Zeit University has a total student population of 5,447, including many foreign students. The university is the oldest and most prominent Palestinian institution of higher education, and has the highest academic standards among the Palestinian universities. Bir Zeit Univesrity also offers several graduate (masters level) courses in topics ranging from statistics to water management to women's studies. Many of the 276-member faculty are foreign or foreign-trained, and conduct many classes in English.  The university was shut down for one month in October, but classes resumed without incident for the next five months. On March 7, 2001, a few hours after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon took office, the Israeli Defense Forces cut the only road connecting Bir Zeit University to the city of Ramallah, located about five miles away. The blockade was tightened after the bombing of a discotheque in Tel Aviv on June 2, just as final exams were underway at the university.  Several students were subsequently injured during demonstrations against the blockade in June, and seventeen were wounded on June 11 when IDF troops fired on a march at Checkpoint Surda.  The IDF has not provided any specific security reasons to explain the checkpoint's placement. The IDF declined to respond to requests for information from Human Rights Watch.  According to faculty and students interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the normal commuting time along the university road to Ramallah was ten to fifteen minutes, but now regularly takes as long as three hours. When Checkpoint Surda is closed completely, the only means of travel between Bir Zeit University and the outside world is through a narrow, brush-filled trail.  According to university officials, after the blockade, attendance was at an average of 60 to 80 percent of normal, dropping below 50 percent on days when the military checkpoint engaged in strict searches. Classes were cut from fifty minutes to forty minutes to accommodate a shorter study day necessary to allow students the extra time necessary for reaching and leaving the university.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine","Free Speech"

Jones noted that corporations could play a useful role in a variety of ways. Computer, telecommunications, and media companies should work toward an end to controls on press and Internet content and for the promotion of full freedom of expression. Garment and footwear companies should press for fundamental labor rights. Construction and transportation companies and urban design firms should insist on due process and fair compensation for anyone evicted as Olympic sites are built. They should also ensure that the Chinese government imposes no restrictions on journalists visiting building and resettlement sites.

Hiltermann, Executive Director of the Arms Division of Human Rights Watch. """"An arms embargo is the only way to stop the human rights violations they have suffered.""""  The 55-page report, """"Crisis of Impunity: The Role of Pakistan, Russia, and Iran in Fueling the Civil War in Afghanistan,"""" details the nature of military support provided to the warring parties; the major transit routes used to move arms and other equipment; the suppliers; the role of state and nonstate actors; and the response of the international community. Human Rights Watch conducted research on military assistance to the Taliban and the United Front over a two-year period, traveling to both Kabul and areas of Afghanistan under United Front control, as well as Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Pakistan, and interviewing government officials, members of the diplomatic community, military officers, civil servants, journalists, academics, and others.  In calling for an embargo on military assistance, Human Rights Watch said that enforcement measures should be carefully structured to ensure a two-sided embargo would not benefit one side, the Taliban, at the expense of the other, the United Front. For reasons of geography and other factors, an embargo is more easily enforced against the United Front than the Taliban.  Lifting the embargo should be made contingent on concrete steps by the factions to end gross violations of human rights and bring perpetrators to justice, Human Rights Watch said.  In the war, all major factions have repeatedly committed serious violations of international law, including killings, indiscriminate aerial bombardment and shelling, direct attacks on civilians, summary executions, rape, persecution on the basis of religion, and the use of antipersonnel landmines. Most of the recent violations, especially summary executions and indiscriminate aerial bombardment, have been by the Taliban, while the United Front has failed to hold its commanders accountable for past abuses.  Many of the factions' violations can be shown to have been """"widespread or systematic,"""" a criterion of crimes against humanity. Direct attacks on civilians and indiscriminate attacks resulting in civilian casualties may amount to war crimes under international humanitarian law.  The report charges that Pakistan has violated the U.N. arms embargo on the Taliban imposed in December 2000 by permitting arms to cross its border into Taliban-controlled territory. The Taliban is the Afghan faction in power in Kabul; Pakistan has been its principal international sponsor. Official denials notwithstanding, Pakistan has provided the Taliban with military advisers and logistical support during key battles; has bankrolled the Taliban; has facilitated transshipment of arms, ammunition, and fuel through its territory; and has openly encouraged the recruitment of Pakistanis to fight for the Taliban. In addition, Saudi Arabia has provided funds to the Taliban, while private actors and some officials benefit from the smuggling that links these countries.  Supporting the coalition of opposition groups known as the United Front are Iran and Russia, with secondary roles played by Tajikistan and, at least until 1998, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Iran has provided weapons, large-scale funding, and training. Russia has played a crucial enabling role in the resupply of United Front forces by arranging for the transport of Iranian aid, as well as providing direct military assistance itself, including transport helicopters in late 2000. Military assistance to United Front forces has crossed the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border with the active collusion of the Russian government. In general, Human Rights Watch supports international sanctions against governments and rebel groups that have engaged in a practice of gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Such sanctions include the imposition of embargoes on arms and other forms of military assistance by the international community. Likewise, governments that provide military assistance to abusive states and rebel groups should be held accountable for the resulting abuses.  The humanitarian toll of twenty years of fighting-some 1.5 million deaths and the massive displacement of populations, famine, and the ruin of the country's economic base-has not figured prominently in international policy on Afghanistan, Human Rights Watch said. Existing U.N. sanctions against the Taliban, imposed to compel the surrender of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi national suspected of having orchestrated the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, do not address the larger issue of the war's impact on the civilian population.  """"The international community has failed to hold Afghanistan's warring factions accountable for violations of international human rights and humanitarian law,"""" said Hiltermann. """"Civilians are at the center of this conflict, and their well-being must be at the center of the solution.""""  In calling for a comprehensive embargo on arms and other military assistance, Human Rights Watch said that Pakistan, in particular, should be pressed to comply with the embargo, especially to prevent the re-supply of ammunition and spare parts to the Taliban. Pakistan should also be urged to accept U.N. monitors to work alongside its own customs personnel, and steps should be taken to penalize Pakistan if it fails to comply with the U.N. embargo. Such measures should be designed to minimize any adverse humanitarian impact in Pakistan.","Asia, Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Russia, Iran","United Nations"

In a letter sent to Croatian Prime Minister Ivica Racan, Human Rights Watch praised the government's recent decision to surrender to the tribunal two Croatian Army generals covered by sealed indictments . It is believed that the generals are charged with war crimes committed during offensives against Serb rebels in September 1993 and August 1995.   Human Rights Watch reiterated that the transfer of the two indictees is firmly mandated by international law, as part of Croatia's overall obligation to cooperate with the tribunal. Human Rights Watch also stressed that the recent transfer of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to the U.N. war crimes tribunal makes it particularly important that other governments in the region also live up to their cooperation obligations, as Croatia has expressed a willingness to do.","Europe/Central Asia, Croatia","International Justice"

The transfer of the two indictees is firmly mandated by international law, as part of Croatia's overall obligation to cooperate with the tribunal. As I am sure you are aware, the tribunal was created in 1993 by U.N. Security Council Resolution 827, which obliged all U.N. member states to """"cooperate fully"""" with the tribunal and """"take any measures necessary under their domestic law"""" to comply with its demands. The U.N. Charter's Article 25, in turn, obliges member states to implement Security Council decisions. Various other Security Council resolutions also require Croatia to cooperation with the tribunal, including resolution 1247 (June 18, 1999), resolution 1305 (June 21, 2000), and resolution 1329 (December 5, 2000).   Research conducted by Human Rights Watch and other organizations has established that members of the Croatian Army perpetrated abuses against Serbian civilians and conducted a """"scorched earth"""" policy during its offensive in the Medak pocket, in September 1993. We also found that during offensive Oluja (Storm), in August 1995, Croatian military bombed retreating Serb civilians and soldiers, and, after the offensive, destroyed villages and property and summarily executed elderly and infirm Serbs who remained behind. As with all war crimes committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, individual accountability for these crimes is necessary to honor the victims and satisfy the basic requirement of international justice.   The recent transfer of former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to The Hague also underscores that all countries are expected to cooperate with the tribunal and makes it particularly important that other governments in the region do so, as your government has appropriately committed to doing. Human Rights Watch also wishes to stress that, as you are aware, but members of the Croat public may not be, the tribunal does not seek to assess the responsibility of the Croatian people, or the decision by the Croats to engage in hostilities, but focuses on particular conduct during the hostilities and the role of particular members of the military in sanctioning or failing to redress that conduct, based on well-established international standards.   Human Rights Watch also applauds the efforts of the Croatian authorities to bring other war crimes suspects to justice, as exemplified by the local proceedings against General Mirko Norac and four other suspects, who are charged with war crimes in connection with the killings of two groups of Serb civilians in Gospic in October 1991. We urge continued support for those efforts. Only through such steps toward accountability can Croatia confirm its democratic transition and prospects for European integration.

When the chief prosecutor at the United Nations's war-crimes court indicted Milosevic in the waning days of the Kosovo war, critics argued that it would prolong the Yugoslav president's time in office by giving him another incentive to cling to power. That was in May 1999.   Slobodan Milosevic's prosecution is a step forward for international human rights and for democracy in Serbia. When the chief prosecutor at the United Nations's war-crimes court indicted Milosevic in the waning days of the Kosovo war, critics argued that it would prolong the Yugoslav president's time in office by giving him another incentive to cling to power. That was in May 1999.   In fact, the indictment helped to delegitimize Milosevic. By October 2000, he had been voted out of office. By April this year, he was under arrest. Now, finally, he is in the tribunal's custody in The Hague, Netherlands.   Prosecuting people outside their own countries for human-rights crimes is a new phenomenon. Until the last decade, most dictators used violence and intimidation to preclude any possibility of trial in their own countries. Now international tribunals and foreign courts have begun to bring these dictators to trial on charges of genocide, torture and rape as crimes of war. This helps enforce a standard of human rights and should give dictators pause before they commit such atrocities.   ROAD TO DEMOCRACY   Behind the struggle over Milosevic has been a debate over whether bringing a powerful tyrant to justice would undermine his country's fragile transition to democracy. It is a debate that resonates around the world in countries that are emerging from dictatorship.   But reckoning with the crimes of the past does not impede the transition to democracy; it facilitates it.   When former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998 for the kidnapping, torture and murder of thousands of people, even some of his critics argued that prosecuting him would destabilize the civilian government in Santiago. Democracy would survive, they said, only by respecting the amnesty that the Chilean military had negotiated for itself. It was better to let sleeping strongmen lie.   But look what happened. Pinochet's arrest allowed the Chilean political system finally to emerge from his shadow. The Chilean judiciary now has mustered the independence to strip him of his immunity and indict him. This week he was declared mentally unfit to stand trial, but the principle that he could be prosecuted has been upheld.   Democracy is about extending the rule of law to everybody, including the heads of state. That's why prosecuting dictators is so important.   In Peru, the autocrat Alberto Fujimori was chased out of power last year because Peruvians were tired of lawlessness at the top. Now, with the revelations of bribery by the former spy chief, Vladimir Montesinos, President-elect Alejandro Toledo is vowing to pursue justice against Montesinos as a crucial element in restoring the rule of law.   In Yugoslavia, Milosevic's transfer to The Hague has brought into the open a power struggle between the nationalistic Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica and Zoran Djindjic, the Serbian prime minister who ordered Milosevic's arrest and surrender. It does not appear, however, that the conflict imperils the democratic transition itself.   Quite the contrary. As Milosevic's trial is broadcast back to Serbia, millions of ordinary Serbs will see and hear the full story of the crimes committed in their name. That should make it harder for nationalist politicians to manipulate their people by hiding the truth. And Milosevic and many of his top cronies will not be on the scene, waiting to take advantage of the moments when people grow frustrated with the pace of reform.   BELGRADE MUST HELP   Western pressure played the key role in facilitating Milosevic's transfer to The Hague. The challenge for Western policy now is to help the proponents of justice within Serbia. Twenty-six indictees remain at large in the Serbian part of Bosnia, while 11 more live in Serbia itself. All of them --especially those most responsible for the atrocities, the Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic and the military lleader Gen. Ratko Mladic -- must go to The Hague.   To insist on Belgrade's full cooperation with the war crimes tribunal is not a punitive measure that will hamper Yugoslav democracy. It is the best way to ensure its ultimate triumph.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

We hope you will make clear that Russia must keep its commitment to respect human rights if it is to build a relationship of trust with its G-8 partners. And we trust that you will emphasize publicly that abuses in Chechnya cannot be justified by the fight against terrorism or what President Putin refers to as """"extremism,"""" and that they will not contribute to a Russia that is strong and respected by the world.  The delivery of such a message has never been more urgent, because the policies of Vladimir Putin's government pose the greatest long-term threat to democratic freedoms in Russia since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Russia's only national independent television station (NTV) has now been brought under quasi-government control. Russia's most popular independent radio station, Ekho Moskvy, is at risk of meeting the same fate in coming weeks. Journalists and at least one human rights activist known for their hard-hitting or critical reporting have been harassed. Russian journalists who investigate abusive conduct by federal forces in Chechnya often suffer persecution; several from Eastern Europe have been deported or denied visas. Criminal prosecutions of several journalists and academics on unfounded charges of espionage point to the resurgence of the Federal Security Service (the former KGB) as a tool to curtail civic and political freedoms. A new government decree regulating Russian academics' interactions with foreigners has had a chilling effect on academic freedom. And rampant corruption has laid waste to the public institutions, particularly in law enforcement, crucial to the rule of law.  The most dramatic illustration of Russia's failure to ensure human rights and the rule of law is the appalling conduct of its forces in Chechnya. In just the past month, federal forces on sweep operations in at least seven villages arbitrarily detained, tortured, and ill-treated hundreds of people. Human Rights Watch researchers currently in the region have documented the cases of more than a dozen men tortured by federal forces in these operations. Outraged by the scale of the abuse, several Chechen administrators who had been loyal to Moscow resigned or threatened to do so. Lt. Ge. Vladimir Moltenskoi, acting commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, initially admitted that large-scale abuses had taken place. This was an unprecedented move, but officials backed away from the criticism, acknowledging that only """"some violations"""" had been committed by individual soldiers. They gave no indications that future sweep operations would be conducted in any different manner.  Although Russian prosecutors say they have opened a criminal investigation into some of the recent abuses, there is little hope that the investigation will be meaningful. Earlier this week, the Council of Europe chastised Russia for ignoring its recommendation to investigate a detention center where guards routinely tortured inmates in early 2000. Just yesterday, a Chechen torture victim interviewed by Human Rights Watch called 2000 """"the year of impunity."""" Russia has made no progress toward inviting U.N. monitors who could investigate torture, forced disappearances, and summary executions. And to the best of our knowledge, not a single high-level commander has been called to account for atrocities against civilians since the conflict began nearly two years ago.  Russia's invitation to join the G8 was predicated not simply on the country's size and importance, but on hopes for its democratic development. But Russian democracy has grown weaker, not stronger in recent months. That should raise serious questions among other G8 states about Russia's continued membership. We ask you publicly to raise concern about these trends at the G8 meeting and during your summit meeting. In particular, we ask that you seek assurances from President Putin regarding the independence of radio station Ekho Moskvy.

The State Department's report was released today, five weeks after the congressionally-mandated deadline of June 1, 2001. No explanation was given for the delay. “The State Department´s report is a real mixed bag,” said LaShawn R. Jefferson, Acting Executive Director of the Women´s Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. “We´re glad the U.S. government is finally paying close attention to this important human rights abuse. But the report has some major flaws that will need correcting the next time around.”  One of the report´s chief weaknesses, Jefferson said, was that it glosses over the problems of state complicity and corruption. Trafficking cannot flourish without the involvement of corrupt police, border guards, and state officials.  Human Rights Watch said the report also concentrates too much on trafficking for “sexual exploitation,” to the exclusion of trafficking into other forms of forced labor, among them sweatshop labor, domestic servitude, and forced agricultural and construction work. Many of the country chapters fail to document whether governments have set up and funded programs to provide victims of trafficking with services.  The State Department released the 102-page report today to comply with the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000. The report evaluates the performance of 82 countries, putting each country in one of three categories depending on how its domestic efforts meet the legislation´s minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking. The law required reporting on all countries worldwide with a “significant number” of trafficking victims.  “The report confirms what human rights activists and experts on trafficking already know: that governments around the world treat victims of trafficking as undocumented migrants, criminals, or both,” said Jefferson. “Governments should be offering protection to these victims, not hitting them with prosecutions.”  Human Rights Watch noted that Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and Pakistan are accurately tiered to reflect their abysmal record on trafficking. However, missing from that list of Tier 3 countries are Moldova, Costa Rica, and Japan.  Human Rights Watch urged the State Department:       to ensure that all future reports consistently include information about all forms of trafficking in persons, not just trafficking for “sexual exploitation”;       to include the role of state complicity and corruption in facilitating trafficking and government measures to identify,investigate, and prosecute state agents involved in trafficking;       to include reporting on human rights protections of trafficking victims, in particular victims´ access to legal counsel and other services (medical, witness protection programs, safe shelter, etc.); and       to include information on concrete measures governments are taking to prosecute traffickers.  Select Illustrations Of The Report´s Shortcomings:  COSTA RICA: The country report mentions only trafficking for “sexual exploitation.” The report fails to mention the complicity of state agents in trafficking. Victims of trafficking are deported immediately. Costa Rica should be a Tier 3 country.  JAPAN: The Japanese government treats trafficked women as illegal immigrants or criminals. They are often placed under arrest and deported. The report underrepresents the extent of the Japanese government´s refusal to address this issue as a human rights concern. Japan should be a Tier 3 country. For more information on trafficking to Japan, please see https://www.hrw.org/press/2000/09/japan0921.htm and https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/japan/  ISRAEL: The report fails to mention that a recent amendment to the criminal law in Israel criminalizes only trafficking for forced prostitution, excluding all those who are trafficked into other forms of forced labor in Israel. Israel has failed to root out official corruption and failed to protect witnesses.  MOLDOVA: The report acknowledges that the law does not prohibit trafficking. Consequently, there have been no arrests and prosecutions. There are no government-operated and run programs to assist trafficking victims. Moldova should be a Tier 3 country.  NIGERIA: Nigeria is a destination country for trafficking victims from Ghana, Togo, and Benin, which the report fails to acknowledge. In addition, there is enormous trafficking of women and girls within Nigeria. As the report points out, the Nigerian government´s approach to trafficking is very narrow, focusing only on trafficking for “sexual exploitation.” There are no shelters and few services for trafficking victims in Nigeria.","United States, Global","Children's Rights, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

J. Patterson to order an independent and impartial inquiry into the killing of more than twenty civilians in West Kingston. The killings occurred during police and army sweeps of the neighborhoods of Tivoli Gardens and Denham Town, which began last Saturday. The violence continued for several days, abating by Wednesday.  Although police and soldiers claim that they shot their weapons after coming under fire themselves, some neighborhood residents report that the security forces fired indiscriminately. In addition to a reported twenty-two civilians, three police officers and a soldier were also killed.  """"The extreme violence of Jamaica's police action means that a thorough investigation is needed,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"And to be credible, the investigation must be independent and impartial.""""  Jamaica has one of the worst records of police violence in the world, with official statistics listing an average of 140 people shot and killed annually over the last ten years. Given the country's small population, only 2.6 million, these figures are shockingly high.  Jamaica also has a poor record of failing to properly investigate and prosecute violations committed by police and soldiers. Police investigators do not, in general, look into crimes allegedly committed by members of the security forces in an impartial or thorough manner. The result is a high degree of impunity for such crimes.  Given this background, Human Rights Watch is calling on the Jamaican authorities to establish an independent body with the necessary powers to carry out a full investigation of the recent violence. The members of this body should immediately interview witnesses to the killings and the members of the security forces believed to have been involved. Proper autopsies of dead should be conducted, and all other relevant forensic evidence should be obtained.  Human Rights Watch also said that, because of past incidents of intimidation of witnesses to police violence, it is crucial that all such persons be protected from pressure and reprisals.","Americas, Jamaica",""

If it does, the human rights controversy around the selection will not be over. From now until 2008, human rights issues will arise around every Olympic site constructed and every decision made about who will be able to attend the Games as athletes, spectators or reporters. The IOC, should get out in front of the debate, even at this late stage, and set down some fundamental human rights principles about the conduct of the Games. The IOC's pious rhetoric about how politics and sports don't mix is nonsense. Beijing is not a front-runner because of the clean air that the athletes will breathe or China's record of fairness in international sports. It is a favorite for a mixture of political and economic reasons, combined with what is probably the hardest sell in history on the part of the bidder. If China believed that human rights considerations should not be a factor in Friday's decision, it should have stopped its ambassador to the United States from sending a letter to every member of the U.S. Congress in April arguing that """"any attempt to deny China's right to host the Games is a challenge to the universal principle of human rights."""" The right to host the Games is not on any list of fundamental freedoms, but if the Chinese authorities want a discussion on rights, the IOC should give it to them. This is not to say that a country's human rights record should be the determining factor in whether a city gets the Games. If rights were the main criterion, the bid of Mexico City might have fallen short. And it is possible that there can be a positive impact on a tightly controlled society from hosting an international event. But the IOC has a responsibility for ensuring that the Games themselves take place in an atmosphere free of repression and discrimination. If China starts denying visas for Olympic events to Taiwanese, Tibetans, suspected Falun Gong members, human rights organizations or potentially hostile media; if it continues to harass foreign reporters for trying to cover Olympic-related stories; if it takes draconian measures against migrant workers and others living on designated building sites or along main thoroughfares it won't be just Chinese authorities who look bad. The IOC will be complicit. The IOC should consider adopting a code of conduct that includes both a clear set of principles and a method for verification and enforcement. One principle might be that any bidder for the Games should undertake to guarantee that no one will be denied access to the Games, as participant or spectator, on the grounds of political belief, religion, national origin, sexual orientation or other characteristics. Another might be that bidders should also ensure that land acquisition for and construction of Olympic sites, and all other matters related to the bid for the Games and implementation of a successful bid, take place in a situation of full transparency, with contracts and financial records made fully available to the public. It would be particularly important to ensure that no restrictions be placed on nonviolent protests that take place in connection with the Games. A city's bid should be evaluated in part in terms of the plan it puts forward to apply these principles, together with the bidder's willingness to accept an independent monitoring team to check how the plan is implemented.

On July 7, police returned the corpse of forty-four-year old Shovrik Ruzimuradov, head of the Kashkadaria branch of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan (HRSU), to his family. Police had arrested him on June 15. According to the HRSU, Ruzimuradov's family buried him on July 8. Human Rights Watch is concerned that Ruzimuradov may have died as a result of ill-treatment. He had been held incommunicado in an undisclosed location for twenty-one days after his arrest. Uzbek law enforcement officials repeatedly blocked his family's attempts to locate him in custody; the HRSU reported that he died in the basement of the Ministry of Internal Affairs building.  Adding to suspicion surrounding the activist's death, police blocked all entry within one kilometer of the Ruzimuradov home in the southwestern province of Kashkadaria, and turned away fellow rights defenders who traveled from Tashkent to view the body and take part in funeral services. Activists reported that police threatened to arrest them and """"tear [them] to pieces"""" if they investigated the case further. The activists were interrogated and expelled from the area.  """"Ruzimuradov shouldn't have been in custody in the first place,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Uzbek government has to answer for this tragedy.""""  Andersen urged the international community in Tashkent to demand a prompt, thorough, and impartial investigation of Ruzimuradov's death.  Torture in police custody is widespread in Uzbekistan. In a December 2000 report, Human Rights Watch documented fifteen deaths in custody due to torture during the past three years. Last week, Human Rights Watch protested Ruzimuradov's detention in a letter to Uzbek president Islam Karimov, calling on him to reveal the rights defender's whereabouts and to allow Ruzimuradov access to a lawyer.  Police arrested Shovrik Ruzimuradov, a former people's deputy in Uzbekistan's parliament, on June 15, 2001 in Kashkadaria. Officers allegedly planted narcotics, several bullets, and literature of the unregistered Islamic organization Hizb ut-Tahrir to justify the activist's arrest, and physically abused Ruzimuradov's female relatives when they requested that witnesses be called to observe the police operation. The officers confiscated Ruzimuradov's computer equipment, computer disks, and notebook, and reportedly cut the family's phone lines.  In recent months, Ruzimuradov had spoken out publicly on the arrest of some seventy men from Surkhandaria province who were convicted last month of collaborating with armed insurgents in summer 2000. He also advocated on behalf of the hundreds of people forcibly displaced from their villages in Surkhandaria as part of the armed forces' """"mop up"""" operation there.  Ruzimuradov was the father of seven children.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

Conditions create an effective and measurable mechanism to promote positive change for human rights in Colombia.  Human Rights Watch believes that it is important for this Subcommittee to continue to support human rights in Colombia by including strong and workable human rights conditions in the legislation under consideration. Conditions create an effective and measurable mechanism to promote positive change for human rights in Colombia.  Secondly, we urge this Subcommittee to include increased funds for the Colombian institutions that have a proven record of success against human rights violators in Colombia, prime among them the office of the Attorney General (Fiscal?), the Internal Affairs agency (Procuradur?), and the Public Advocate (Defensor?). The aid proposal from the Administration displays a greater emphasis on funding civilian initiatives, which we welcome, but much more is needed and specifically for these critical offices. For example, in 2000 and the first three months of 2001 -- a period of fifteen months -- the Attorney General's Human Rights Unit and advisers from the Internal Affairs agency received U.S. $65,763 from the U.S. Agency for International Development. Half was spent on flying prosecutors to the United States to learn about the American judicial system, a pursuit that does not address the desperate need for vehicles, travel funds, and other resources to investigate and prosecute a rising number of human rights violations. This works out to less than the amount of U.S. military assistance spent in Colombia in only two hours of a single day. Finally, we urge this Subcommittee to press Colombia's leaders for real progress on stopping attacks against human rights defenders and ensuring accountability for past murders. Even as Colombian authorities continue to provide bullet-proof glass for the offices of threatened human rights groups and bullet-proof vests and body guards for human rights defenders who receive death threats, these brave individuals continue to be murdered by experienced killers who continue to count on impunity for their crimes. Cases involving the murder of human rights defenders-among them the 1996 killing of Josu?Giraldo Cardona; the 1997 killings of Mario Calder?, Elsa Alvarado, and Carlos Alvarado; the 1998 killings of Jes? Valle Jaramillo and Eduardo Uma? Mendoza; the 1999 killing of Julio Gonz?ez and Everardo de Jes? Puerta; the 2000 killing of Jaime Garz? and Elizabeth Ca?s, just to name a few-languish, in the best of cases with only the gunmen arrested and not the people who planned and paid for the killings.  Overview The human rights situation in Colombia has deteriorated markedly since Public Law (P.L.) 106-246 was signed last year. This deterioration is the result of at least three factors: the Colombian government's continuing failure to address continuing collaboration between its forces and abusive paramilitaries; continuing impunity for military officers implicated in gross violations; and international humanitarian law violations committed by rebels, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej?cito del Pueblo, FARC-EP). According to the Colombian National Police, the number of massacres they recorded in 2000 increased by 22 percent over the previous year, most the work of paramilitaries who continue to enjoy, at the very least, the tolerance of the Colombian Armed Forces. In the first six months of this year, the police report yet another increase, from 84 massacres registered in the first six months of 2000 to 98 massacres registered in the first six months of 2001, with a total of 568 victims.  Human rights defenders, trade unionists, journalists, and community leaders continue to lead the lists of people killed because of their work. Only on July 1, for example, did authorities discover the body of Alma Rosa Jaramillo Lafourie near the city of Barrancabermeja, Santander, long the home of a vibrant and broad-based human rights movement. Several days earlier, this human rights defender had been kidnaped by paramilitaries, who have been engaged in a deadly campaign against rights workers in the region. Jaramillo was a valued colleague of Father Francisco de Roux, a Jesuit priest who runs the Middle Magdalena Development and Peace Program. Some of you have met with Father De Roux, and are aware of his valuable and dangerous work in defense of local communities in the region. Last year, an estimated 319,000 people were forced to flee their homes, the highest number of displaced persons recorded in a single year in the last five years. Thousands of Colombians are leaving the country, and there is a growing sense that violence will only continue to worsen in the latter half of 2001. Instead of bringing hope and expectation for the future, the millenium has brought terror and a spiraling sense of hopelessness to many Colombians.  Military-paramilitary ties Human Rights Watch continues to document abundant, detailed, and compelling evidence that certain Colombian army brigades and police detachments promote, work with, support, and tolerate paramilitary groups, treating them as a force allied to and compatible with their own. At their most brazen, these relationships involve active coordination during military operations between government and paramilitary units; communication via radios, cellular telephones, and beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the names of suspected guerrilla collaborators; the sharing of fighters, including active-duty soldiers serving in paramilitary units and paramilitary commanders lodging on military bases; the sharing of vehicles, including army trucks used to transport paramilitary fighters; and the coordination of army roadblocks, which routinely let heavily-armed paramilitary fighters pass. In particular, officers at the brigade and battalion level and in some police detachments routinely flout, ignore, or circumvent orders from above to break ties to paramilitaries. In violation of the law and the directives of their superiors, these officers continue close and regular relationships with the groups responsible for most human rights violations in Colombia.  Rebel violations In our July 10 letter to the FARC-EP, we document cases involving the killings and cruel and inhuman treatment of captured combatants, abductions of civilians, hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, grossly unfair trials, and forced displacement of civilians. Further, FARC-EP forces continue to use prohibited weapons, including gas cylinder bombs that wreak indiscriminate havoc and cause appalling injuries, and to attack medical workers and facilities in blatant disregard of international law and the most basic standards of respect for human life. In the area ceded to rebels by the Colombian government for talks, the FARC-EP has established a pattern of abducting civilians suspected of supporting paramilitary groups, many of whom are later killed. Unlike abductions carried out for financial reasons, these abductions are often kept hidden. The FARC-EP generally does not disclose the victims' fate or even acknowledge custody. Relatives of those who are seized by the FARC-EP in these circumstances frequently are unable to obtain any information from the FARC-EP about the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones, causing enormous suffering. The victims of these abductions have no protection under the law, let alone legal remedy against false accusations and abuse, nor can their relatives invoke legal remedies on their behalf. We detail other violations committed by guerrillas in our letter, part of our continuing effort to hold all sides in this conflict accountable for their abuses. The Colombian government Some government officials - the Attorney General, the members of his Human Rights Unit, investigators in the Attorney General's Technical Investigation Unit (Cuerpo T?nico de Investigaciones, CTI), the People's Advocate, and the Colombian National Police (CNP) leadership -- have taken important action against paramilitaries. They have investigated their abuses, arrested paramilitary leaders, seized their weapons, and prevented some massacres.  It was largely due to the Attorney General's efforts, for instance, that Colombian law enforcement for the first time successfully impaired the paramilitaries' financial network. In May, a combined team of Attorney General prosecutors and CTI agents carried out an operation in the city of Monter? that gathered evidence to be used to arrest and prosecute the people who finance paramilitary groups. For their security, this team was protected by an elite Colombian Army unit brought from Bogot? This is a critical and positive development that demonstrates that paramilitary groups are vulnerable and can be brought to justice.  Unfortunately, this operation remains an anomaly. To date, the good work of the Attorney General's office has been consistently and effectively undermined, canceled out, or in some cases wholly reversed by actions promoted by the military-paramilitary alliance and inaction by the Pastrana Administration. Despite its statements to the contrary, the Pastrana Administration has not moved aggressively to acknowledge military-paramilitary collaboration and take effective action to ensure respect for human rights. To date, efforts to break these ties have been ineffective or, in some cases, wholly absent. Even as President Pastrana publicly deplores successive atrocities, each seemingly more gruesome than the last, high-ranking officers fail to take the obvious, critical steps necessary to prevent future killings by suspending suspect security force members suspected of abuses, delivering their cases to civilian judicial authorities for investigation, and pursuing and arresting paramilitaries Eyewitnesses, municipal officials, and even the government's own investigators routinely delivered to the security forces detailed and current information about the exact location of paramilitary bases; license plates, colors and types of paramilitary vehicles; cellular telephone and beeper numbers used by paramilitaries; and the names of paramilitaries. Yet despite dozens of """"early warnings"""" of planned atrocities, paramilitaries advanced, killed, mutilated, burned, destroyed, stole, and threatened with virtual impunity, often under the very noses of security force officers sworn to uphold public order. Just as routinely, the security forces, in particular the military, have not moved against paramilitaries or have engaged in actions that produced only delays and allowed paramilitaries to continue their activities with impunity. Again and again, troops arrived at the sites of serious abuses committed by paramilitaries only to count bodies, photograph damages, and make familiar excuses for their failure to protect civilians and capture the paramilitaries responsible for abuses. Meanwhile, hundreds of arrest warrants against paramilitary leaders issued by the Attorney General's office remain unenforced because the military chooses not to execute them. According to the CTI, investigators attached to the Attorney General's office, they had over 300 arrest warrants against alleged paramilitary members pending in January 2001. Among them were at least twenty-two separate warrants against Carlos Casta? for massacres, killings, and the kidnaping of human rights defenders and a Colombian senator. Government investigators from four separate institutions consulted by Human Rights Watch agreed that the main obstacle to arrests was the Colombian military. The military, according to these investigators, refused to send troops to make arrests or else leaks arrest plans to paramilitaries, frustrating operations.. For its part, the military claimed that it has arrested paramilitaries. But civilian government investigators have insisted to Human Rights Watch that most of those counted as detained in military tallies were merely low-ranking fighters, not leaders and key organizers. The Attorney General's office, some times acting in coordination with the CTI and CNP, has a significantly better record of arresting paramilitary leaders. Far from strengthening key government institutions that investigate human rights cases, the Pastrana Administration has significantly weakened them by cutting their budgets, failing to adequately protect prosecutors and investigators, and failing to provide adequate funds to protect threatened witnesses. According to the Attorney General, decreases have been so extreme that they threaten key teams, like the Human Rights Unit, with paralysis. This was made dramatically clear to Human Rights Watch during a visit to the Human Rights Unit prosecutors in January 2001. During the interview, one prosecutor was frantically calling various officials to get a seat on an interior ministry helicopter for a colleague to investigate massacres in the department of Valle. Such incidents, he said, were commonplace.  U.S. policy Human Rights Watch firmly believes that the United States has an important role to play in Colombia and can help to support human rights. There have been some positive developments in Washington and from the U.S. Embassy in Bogot? The chapter on Colombia in the annual country reports on human rights issued by the State Department continues to reflect an accurate, albeit grim picture of the worsening human rights situation. As importantly, U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson has begun a long-overdue policy of speaking out on the human rights situation, and expressing concern over specific cases. Her timely, personal interventions in recent cases have been a critical factor in spurring the Colombian authorities to act to address the paramilitary advance.  Nevertheless, it remains clear that much more needs to be done. U.S. law prohibits military aid from going to security force units engaged in abusive behavior until effective steps are taken to bring perpetrators to justice. Last year, the U.S. Congress wisely included human rights conditions specific to Colombia in P.L. 106-246. These were conditions that we strongly supported, and this Subcommittee in particular merits recognition for ensuring that they were made part of the law.  However, on August 22, 2000, President Bill Clinton signed a waiver that lifted these conditions, allowing security assistance to be provided to the Colombian military even as the State Department reported that these forces continued to work with paramilitary groups. With one signature, the White House sent a direct message to Colombia's military leaders that overshadowed any other related to human rights. Judged by the Colombian military's behavior in the field - not by rhetoric or public relations pamphlets - its leaders understood this message clearly. Even as Colombia's high command has agreed to scrub a few units for human rights problems, the rest of the military appears to have a virtual carte blanche for continued, active coordination with the paramilitary groups responsible for most human rights violations in Colombia.  Human Rights Watch remains convinced that the most important way that the United States can contribute to improving human rights protections in Colombia is to enforce strict and workable conditions on all military aid. These conditions should not include a waiver. Enforcement of the conditions contained in Public Law 106?246 would have contributed greatly to improving human rights protection, in my opinion.","Americas, United States, Colombia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/09/colombia-rebel-abuses-worsening","Colombia- Rebel Abuses Worsening","Colombia: Rebel Abuses Worsening","Human Rights Watch Letter to Commander Manuel Marulanda","07/09/2001","In this twenty-page letter to Manuel Marulanda, the commander-in-chief  of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (Fuerzas  Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo,  FARC-EP), Human Rights Watch described the FARC-EP's  responsibility for serious abuses, including killings of civilians,  hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, grossly unfair trials, the cruel and inhuman treatment of captured combatants, and the forced displacement of civilians. I urge you to issue clear and strict instructions to all FARC-EP forces to cease immediately all activities that violate international humanitarian law. At the same time, I also urge you to adopt effective measures that allow the supervision of a policy of respect for international humanitarian law in order to prevent these serious abuses from continuing.  The recent release of police and soldiers, some suffering serious illness, is a positive step that Human Rights Watch recognizes. At the same time, the FARC-EP continues to violate key provisions of international humanitarian law meant to protect civilians and combatants hors de combat.  Human Rights Watch welcomes current efforts to achieve peace in Colombia, and we hope that the negotiations taking place between the Colombian government and the FARC-EP will soon bring the conflict to an end. The civilian population of Colombia suffers enormously because of the conflict, with thousands killed, """"disappeared,"""" kidnaped, tortured, mutilated, and detained arbitrarily. Many hundreds of thousands have been internally displaced or forced by violence to flee the country. Particularly repugnant is that parties to the conflict, including the FARC-EP, have drawn children into the conflict as combatants, hostages, and spies.  As I will detail below, the FARC-EP has committed serious violations of international humanitarian law. We have found, specifically, that the FARC-EP is responsible for the killings and abductions of civilians, hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, grossly unfair trials, cruel and inhuman treatment of captured combatants, and forced displacement of civilians. Further, FARC-EP forces continue to use prohibited weapons, including gas cylinder bombs that wreak indiscriminate havoc and cause appalling injuries, and to attack medical workers and facilities in blatant disregard of international law and the most basic standards of respect for human life.  Human Rights Watch's findings are based upon first-hand research in Colombia, including a visit in May-June 2000 to the zone established for peace talks by the Colombian government and the FARC-EP (hereinafter Zone). During that visit, we held meetings with several FARC-EP commanders, and have since received additional information from a wide range of public and private sources.  Since that mission, Human Rights Watch has continued to collect information linking the FARC-EP to serious violations of international humanitarian law. Among the most egregious recent violations is the killing of Congressman Diego Turbay Cote and six others outside Florencia, Caquetá on December 29, 2000. The massacre took place as Turbay, chair of the Peace Commission in Colombia's House of Representatives, and his companions were headed toward a meeting with the FARC-EP leadership in Los Pozos. According to reports, after puncturing the tires of the vehicles and ordering the passengers to lie face down on the road, gunmen shot each person in the head.  The FARC-EP denied committing this massacre, but the Attorney General's office has opened a formal investigation of alleged guerrillas based on testimonies of captured gunmen and other evidence. In press interviews, prosecutors have characterized the evidence linking the FARC-EP and specifically the Teófilo Forero column to the killings as """"decisive."""" (1)  Human Rights Watch bases its assessment of the FARC-EP's conduct on the requirements of international humanitarian law, notably article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the 1977 Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions. None of these international humanitarian law requirements are open to negotiation. Instead, they impose binding legal obligations on the FARC-EP as a party to the conflict in Colombia.  Commander Marulanda, these instruments should be embraced fully and without condition by you and your organization, and we urge you to make a public commitment to this effect. You should instruct FARC-EP forces to respect these standards scrupulously both within the Zone and elsewhere in Colombia.  In particular, we urge you to issue orders and take effective steps to ensure that FARC-EP forces:  cease all extrajudicial killings of civilians; release immediately and unconditionally all hostages held by FARC-EP forces, with guarantees of their safe return to their families; cease using child soldiers, establish mechanisms for the immediate demobilization of child soldiers, and instruct all FARC-EP forces that child soldiers should not be recruited or deployed as combatants in the future; cease holding so-called trials, which lack minimal due process guarantees; ensure that all captured combatants, including police, soldiers, and members of paramilitary groups, are afforded humane treatment, including appropriate medical care, and are permitted regular access to and visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), whose mandate is to promote compliance with and the interpretation of the Geneva Conventions; cease all use of indiscriminate weapons, such as gas cylinder bombs; cease all attacks or threats against medical workers and facilities, including ambulances, hospitals, and clinics. Human Rights Watch also believes that mechanisms should be put in place without delay to protect the rights of persons residing in the Zone. The estimated 90,000 inhabitants of the five municipalities comprising the Meta and Caquetá departments that make up the Zone were not consulted prior to its establishment in November 1998, and no special mechanisms were put in place to protect their rights following the withdrawal of Colombian police and military forces. While the offices of the People's Advocate (Defensoría) continues to receive complaints of abuses in the Zone, it has neither the power nor resources necessary to intervene to prevent such abuses. The Attorney General's Office, which has a legal responsibility to investigate and prosecute abuses, is not able to operate in the Zone, its staff having been forced to leave by order and under threat from the FARC-EP. (2)  In light of President Andrés Pastrana's February 2001 decision to extend the Zone for eight months, Human Rights Watch believes that it is imperative that effective measures be taken to ensure the protection of the rights of all residents of the Zone. We therefore urge the FARC-EP to make a public commitment to permit immediately a system of independent national and international monitoring within the Zone.  Applicable International Legal Standards  Human Rights Watch's assessment of the actions of the FARC-EP is primarily guided by two sets of international legal standards: article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the 1977 Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions. (3) These standards extend no political recognition, status, or approval to any armed group. Their object is simply to minimize human suffering and establish respect for basic humanitarian rules, which apply even in the midst of hostilities. (4)  Common article 3 covers armed conflicts """"not of an international character,"""" and includes the internal armed conflict in Colombia. Common article 3 automatically applies when a situation of armed conflict exists. It covers all parties to the conflict. Protocol II applies when opposing forces in an internal armed conflict are under a responsible command, exercise enough control over territory to mount sustained and coordinated military operations, and have the capacity to implement Protocol II. The situation in Colombia clearly satisfies these criteria.  Among the key standards in these documents relevant to Colombia are prohibitions on the killing of civilians and of combatants who are hors de combat, hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, forced displacement of civilians, and indiscriminate attacks. (5)  1. The definition of civilian population  In accordance with current international practice, we define civilians as persons who do not actively participate in hostilities and are not parties to the conflict. The distinction between civilians and combatants is a key one, and one that did not appear to be understood or accepted by the FARC-EP commanders whom Human Rights Watch met in May-June 2000. Under international humanitarian rules, simply feeding a combatant, disseminating propaganda, or engaging in political activities in support of an armed group does not convert a civilian into a combatant. Instead, direct participation in hostilities must be present in order for a civilian to lose his or her protected status. (6)  The issue of intelligence gathering is particularly relevant to Colombia. Residents of territories where combatants are present necessarily come across information that could be of assistance to the parties to the conflict and they may, knowingly or unknowingly, transmit it, as occurs in Colombia. Yet the transmission of information does not in itself make such persons combatants. Among the pursuits that would not convert a civilian into a combatant are transmitting information that is gathered in the course of normal activities or transmitting information that is not of direct use in launching an attack. (7)  2. Fair and impartial trials  International humanitarian law also obligates the parties to a conflict to respect fully the fair and impartial trial guarantees contained in article 6 of Protocol II whenever they investigate and punish enemy combatants or their own fighters accused of abuses. The FARC-EP has failed utterly to respect these obligations. Though it has periodically announced trials, including some resulting in executions, they have been marked by gross violations of the guarantees set out in Protocol II.  The FARC-EP rarely informs accused persons of the charges against them or the procedure it intends to follow, and the accused are not permitted adequate means for their defense. Often, the accused are presumed guilty from the outset and they may not even be permitted to be present during the procedure. Finally, the FARC-EP offers no legal remedies to a decision, even in cases resulting in sentences of death. Such trials and executions constitute serious violations of the laws of war.  In a few cases, international pressure has led the FARC-EP to acknowledge its own responsibility for certain gross violations and to announce publicly that it will sanction the perpetrators. For example, during their May-June 2000 visit to the Zone, FARC-EP commanders told Human Rights Watch's representatives that the two FARC-EP combatants who killed American civilians Terence Freitas, Lahe'ena'e Gay, and Ingrid Washinawatok on March 5, 1999 had been found """"guilty."""" (8) The FARC-EP sentenced the two killers to dig fifty-five yards of trench and clear land, a grossly inappropriate punishment for so grave a crime.  3. The FARC-EP response  During Human Rights Watch's May-June 2000 visit to the Zone, we discussed these international humanitarian law standards with several FARC-EP commanders. They asserted that the standards were not applicable to the armed conflict in Colombia and, in particular, to the conduct of the FARC-EP. In these commanders' view, the standards did not apply because the FARC-EP had not expressly agreed to them, they represented """"elite interests,"""" and they were not appropriate to the Colombian context. (9) Commander Raúl Reyes, a member of the General Secretariat, did claim, however, that the FARC-EP complies with """"a good part of Protocol II.""""  Human Rights Watch objects to the suggestion that international humanitarian law principles are segregable, a sort of menu from which parties to the conflict can pick and choose. Such a view has no basis in international law. To the contrary, these principles are an integrated set that have at their heart the protection of the civilian population and of combatants who are hors de combat.  While the FARC-EP has at times paid lip service in the past to some requirements of international humanitarian law, it has shown little interest in compliance. Our research shows that even when commanders announce that troops under their authority have been ordered to abide by certain rules, in practice, the FARC-EP continues to violate them. Far from improving, the FARC-EP's record in this regard is worsening.  Abductions and Extrajudicial Executions  In the Zone and areas in dispute with other parties to the conflict, the FARC-EP has established a pattern of abducting civilians suspected of supporting paramilitary groups, many of whom are later killed. Unlike abductions carried out for financial reasons, these abductions are often kept hidden. The FARC-EP generally does not disclose the victims' fate or even acknowledge custody. Relatives of those who are seized by the FARC-EP in these circumstances frequently are unable to obtain any information from the FARC-EP about the fate or whereabouts of their loved ones, causing enormous suffering. The victims of these abductions have no protection under the law, let alone legal remedy against false accusations and abuse, nor can their relatives invoke legal remedies on their behalf.  These violations would qualify as forced disappearances under international human rights law if carried out by government officials or organized groups and private individuals acting on behalf of or with the support of a government. The fact that these actions do not qualify at the moment as a violation of specific human rights treaties should not, however, lead to any confusion about their nature. Abductions are serious human rights abuses independent of legal or linguistic niceties. They also constitute blatant violations of the FARC-EP's obligations under international humanitarian law and in particular key provisions of article 4 of Protocol II, which protects against violence to the life, physical, and mental well-being of persons, torture, and ill-treatment.  Human Rights Watch directly investigated three cases of abductions followed by suspected extrajudicial executions during our stay in the Zone, and received information regarding over twenty more suspected executions. For the year 2000, human rights groups reported that the FARC-EP killed 496 civilians nationwide, many accused of being paramilitary or government sympathizers. (10)  1. Juan de Jesús Ossa Giraldo  Human Rights Watch investigated the abduction of Juan de Jesús Ossa Giraldo, which took place just prior to the formal establishment of the Zone. Ossa, then age twenty-two or twenty-three, lived in the town of San Vicente de Caguán and worked in the small Miniteca bistro on the town's main square.  According to friends of the young man, he went on a three-day drinking spree at the end of October 1999 after breaking up with his girlfriend. While drunk, he apparently bragged in public that he worked for the Colombian government. (11)  Ossa returned to work on November 2. The following night, three men dressed in civilian clothes abducted him. According to an eyewitness interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the three men entered the Miniteca bistro at around 8 p.m. and sat down at a table with another man. This man, whom the witness believes was a FARC-EP sympathizer, then pointed at Ossa. At that moment, """"the three grabbed him, one by his collar, one by his pants, and one by his belt. He tried to resist them and they pulled out their pistols. They had nine millimeter pistols."""" (12)  The three armed men took Ossa outside, forced him into the back seat of a waiting yellow taxi with covered license plates, and drove off. His family and friends have not seen him since that time, nor have they been able to obtain firm information about his fate. One of his friends informed Human Rights Watch that a person connected to the FARC-EP later told him that Ossa had been killed. (13)  A FARC-EP commander apparently confirmed this at a meeting with representatives of the office of the People's Advocate on May 28, 1999, stating that the FARC-EP had executed Ossa because they had """"proof that he belonged to the [Colombian military] special forces and was conducting intelligence actions."""" (14) However, to our knowledge, the FARC-EP did not provide any evidence to support this allegation, nor has it informed Ossa's family of his fate.  2. The Gnostic killings  At the same meeting on May 28, 1999, a FARC-EP commander identified as Joaquín told the representatives of the People's Advocate that the FARC-EP had also killed Arnulfo Cala Mejía, Alvaro Garrido, and Richard Rubio. All three were members of a Gnostic Christian group that had been arranging to purchase land near Puerto Rico, just outside the Zone. Between May 9 and 15, 1999, the FARC-EP's Teófilo Forero column detained approximately eighteen members of this group on suspicion of paramilitary links. Commander Joaquín stated that FARC-EP forces had executed the three named above, detained others for further investigation, and released four minors. (15)  The Attorney General's Human Rights Unit later reported that the FARC-EP had killed ten other members of the group, all adults, and released one. (16)  On June 14, 1999, a FARC-EP commander identified as Laurentino was reported to have attempted to justify this to the press by saying that he had ordered the killings of the members of the group because he was not prepared to allow paramilitaries to enter the Zone and derail the peace process. Commander Laurentino provided no evidence to support these accusations. (17) Commander Laurentino was then reputedly the Teófilo Forero column's head of finances. (18)  3. Guillermo Lombana Lizcano and William Vargas Silva  The cases of Guillermo Lombana Lizcano and William Vargas Silva, both reportedly suspected by the FARC-EP of having paramilitary links, were also investigated by Human Rights Watch. Both residents of the town of San Vicente, the two were abducted by the FARC-EP forces on April 16 and April 17, 1999, respectively. (19)  Guillermo Lombana, then sixteen years old, had been a high school student but was not currently enrolled in school. He was seized in front of his home on the evening of April 16. His father, Guillermo Lombana Sr., told Human Rights Watch:  He was in the living room here, sitting in a chair. It was about 9:30 p.m. I was here. There were about fifteen of us, the whole family. The FARC arrived, all men, and all armed and in uniform. My son went out to talk to a friend and they were waiting for him. Two of them grabbed him while one stood aside. They put him in a taxi. We ran outside because friends had yelled, """"Look, they're taking your boy!"""" We hadn't had any threats from the FARC, we never had any kind of problem with them. It was a surprise./ (20)  Early the next morning, Guillermo Lombana Sr. began to search for his son:  At 5 a.m. the next morning I went to the checkpoint. I heard he was at the guerrilla camp. They kept sending me to different commanders, who kept saying they knew nothing about the case. They never say they have him. They never say if he's alive. They don't tell me anything.  According to several people interviewed by Human Rights Watch, a few days after his abduction Guillermo Lombana was shown on national television confessing that he worked for the paramilitaries. A woman who saw the program remembered: """"He said he took an instructional course in Puerto Rico on how to be a paramilitary, how to get information on the guerrillas. But he wasn't convincing. There were lots of questions to him, but they didn't show the questioner. He kept looking off to the side. He seemed very afraid."""" (21)  Lombana's father continued:  We were watching television and suddenly saw him on the news. He was on RCN [a television channel] and Caracol [a television channel], lots of different stations. He was upset. They didn't say where he was, just that it was a FARC camp. He kept glancing to the side. He was scared . . . . The TV show was the last time I saw him.  Lombana's father has persisted in his quest to find his son, writing letters to FARC-EP commanders and speaking to those who agree to see him. He told Human Rights Watch, """"I just want to know if my son is dead or alive. If he's alive, I'd like to see him.""""  On April 17, 1999, the day after Guillermo Lombana's abduction, William Vargas Silva was also reportedly abducted by the FARC-EP. Vargas, then age twenty-seven, was a metal worker who lived with his parents and three sisters in central San Vicente. His family does not believe he had any connections with paramilitaries. They say he left the house on the afternoon of April 17 and did not return. They were informed by a witness to the event, however, that he was abducted by FARC-EP forces and bundled into a yellow taxi, together with his bicycle, at 9 p.m. that night in the center of San Vicente. (22)  Members of the family told Human Rights Watch that they searched for him but have been unable to obtain any firm information from the FARC-EP about his whereabouts or fate. His mother said, """"We've spoken to all of the commanders. They never say whether they have him. They say to wait. They say they're investigating."""" (23)  At a meeting on May 28, 1999, a FARC-EP commander informed the representatives of the People's Advocate that the FARC-EP had detained and was prosecuting both Lombana and Vargas for allegedly conducting paramilitary activities in the Zone. At that time, the office of the People's Advocate was investigating a total of twenty alleged abductions reportedly carried out within the Zone, some by FARC-EP forces and others by armed men of unknown affiliation. (24)  As stated above, under international humanitarian law, the FARC-EP has an obligation to ensure that any real or alleged enemy combatants or members of their own forces who are accused of offences receive fair and impartial trials. While acknowledging that a number of those named above have been killed or executed by FARC-EP forces for alleged links to opposing paramilitary forces, the FARC-EP has provided no information to indicate that they received fair and impartial trials. Indeed, Human Rights Watch has found no evidence to indicate that the FARC-EP has made any effort to hold fair and impartial trials. On the contrary, the evidence indicates clearly that persons abducted by FARC-EP forces within the Zone have been summarily executed in gross breach of the laws of war.  4. People's Advocate investigations  At the May 28, 1999 meeting with representatives of the People's Advocate's office, Commander Joaquín stated that the FARC-EP had killed seven other people in the Zone: Hernando León Perdomo, of San Vicente, detained December 27, 1998; José Libardo Cabrera Toro, of San Vicente, detained February 14, 1999; Luis Ernesto Granados, of San Vicente, detained March 15, 1999; Antonio Muñeton, Wilmer Muñeton, and Freddy Valencia, of San Vicente, detained May 18, 1999; and the son of Leonel Enrique Granados Monroy, of Los Pozos, San Vicente, detained in May 1999 and whose name was not included in People's Advocate report on the meeting. (25)  The People's Advocate reported nine other executions by the FARC-EP within the Zone, including Ramiro Herrera Triana, of Vista Hermosa, in September 1999; José Joaquín Reyes López, of Vista Hermosa, in October 1999; and Celiano Taruche Martínez, of Vista Hermosa, in February 2000. (26) This figure also includes six people from Guayabal, San Vicente del Caguán, who were reportedly killed by the FARC-EP in late December 1999 or early January 2000. (27)  In August 2000, the People's Advocate announced that his staff had confirmed a total of twenty-two abductions and twenty-three killings in the Zone since its establishment, although not all were explicitly attributed to the FARC-EP. (28)  Inhumane Treatment of Captured Combatants  International humanitarian law requires that all parties to a conflict treat captured combatants humanely. This means that the FARC-EP is obligated to extend humane treatment to all members of opposing forces who are in its custody, including the over 450 members of the Colombian police and military currently held. (29)  In discussions with Human Rights Watch in June 2000, FARC-EP commanders acknowledged the importance of this principle. When asked to specify what rules of international humanitarian law the FARC-EP complies with, commanders uniformly singled out the humane treatment of captured combatants. (30)  Yet Human Rights Watch is concerned that the FARC-EP has not complied with even these norms. We have received testimony indicating that several captured combatants have been denied medical attention, among them Colombian National Police (CNP) Col. Álvaro León Acosta, captured on April 5, 2000, near Tuluá, Valle, after his helicopter crashed. According to Acosta's family and the CNP, during his fourteen-month captivity he suffered from serious ailments stemming from a back injury sustained in the crash that went untreated. (31)  On June 5, 2001, the Colombian government and FARC-EP finalized an agreement that led to the release that same day of Acosta and the three police agents who were seized with him after the crash. (32) In a subsequent interview with the news weekly Semana from his hospital bed, Acosta recounted how his untreated injuries caused him excruciating pain and drove him to the brink of suicide three times. His primary care came from his fellow captives and a FARC-EP guerrilla he identified as a nurse who supplied him with sedatives that had virtually no effect. (33)  Subsequently, the FARC-EP released over 300 additional police and soldiers held after capture, some also seriously ill. (34) In exchange, the government released from prison eleven FARC-EP members also reportedly ill. (35)  However, reports indicated that not all captives who were seriously ill were among those first to be released. The FARC-EP selected prisoners to be released and did not allow independent organizations, like the ICRC, to examine those who remained. (36) According to an association of family members that was allowed to visit 261 detainees in February 2001, one police agent, Manuel Alejandro Martínez, suffered serious burns prior to his capture and requires surgery. Others reportedly have a variety of jungle diseases that have gone untreated, including malaria, fungi, constant diarrhea because of contaminated water, and leishmaniasis, which can be fatal if untreated. Many reportedly suffer severe trauma and psychological ailments from prolonged captivity under harsh conditions. (37)  The FARC-EP has never allowed the ICRC or any other independent group to visit any of the captured security force members remaining after the June 2001 releases and collect their own information. According to the reports of family members who visited them in February 2001, the detainees are kept in rudimentary shelters that lack proper drainage, sanitation, and clean water. (38)  Indiscriminate Weapons  Increasingly, the FARC-EP is using weapons that cause significant and avoidable civilian casualties, in violation of international humanitarian rules. Among them are gas cylinder bombs, which are impossible to aim consistently and often strike civilian homes and shops as well as churches, health centers, and municipal offices, causing avoidable civilian casualties.  Gas cylinder bombs are made with a tank normally used to supply a household stove. The tank is loaded with fuel and shrapnel, then placed in a tube packed with dynamite. Typically, the tube is placed on the bed of a pickup truck positioned near the area that guerrillas intend to attack. The tank is launched when operators light a fuse linked to the dynamite charge. The tubes cannot be aimed accurately and are consideredindiscriminate weapons.  The use of indiscriminate weapons is a violation of one of the most fundamental principles of the laws of war, which requires that combatants be distinguished from noncombatants and that military objectives be distinguished from protected property or protected places. Parties to a conflict must direct their operations only against military objectives.  Under Protocol I, article 51(4), indiscriminate attacks are prohibited. Indiscriminate attacks are attacks that are not directed solely against a military objective; that employ a method or means of combat that cannot be directed at a specific military objective; or employ a method or means of combat whose effects cannot be limited as required by the Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction.  Although this protocol applies only to situations of international armed conflict, the provisions prohibiting indiscriminate warfare are part of customary international law and are binding on all parties to both internal and international conflicts.  In Vigía del Fuerte, Antioquia, a FARC-EP attack with gas cylinder bombs on March 25, 2000 resulted in the deaths of six civilians as the gas cylinders exploded on their homes. Among the dead were Nuria del Caicedo, her four-year-old son Jair, and her three-year-old daughter Leydy. The town's center was left a ruin, with the parish building, the mayor's offices, the power company, and ten civilian dwellings destroyed. (39)  There have also been reports that the FARC-EP may be adding substances to these weapons to increase their destructive power. In San Antonio de los Micos, Tolima, for instance, the CNP reported that they had found signs that guerrillas had added ammonium nitrate to the gas cylinder bombs used in the February 25, 2001 attack on the town. Guerrillas destroyed the residence of the local priest and several civilian homes. (40)  The FARC-EP itself has recognized that these devices cause avoidable civilian casualties. In an interview with the newspaper Voz, Commander Jorge Briceño, known as """"Mono Jojoy"""" and a member of the General Secretariat, said """"What we have acknowledged is that mistakes have been committed with the use of [gas cylinders], the civilian population has been affected and this is not our intention.""""/ (41)  Nevertheless, the FARC-EP continues to use gas cylinder bombs. In the first four months of 2001, the FARC-EP used gas cylinder bombs in at least two attacks on Colombian towns. (42)  Hostage-taking  Hostage-taking violates international humanitarian law, in particular article 1(b) of Common article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, and article 4(2)(c) of Protocol II. Hostages are defined by the ICRC as persons who """"find themselves, willingly or unwillingly, in the power of the enemy and who answer with their freedom or their life for compliance with [the enemy's] orders."""" (43) In Colombia, acts that qualify as hostage-taking under international humanitarian law are commonly known as """"kidnaping.""""  One of the cases documented by Human Rights Watch is that of Henry A. Grosch-Garces, who was seized by the FARC-EP at his residence at La Bocana, on Buevaventura's harbor, on May 28, 1999. Subsequently, his family received several telephone calls demanding a ransom from a man who identified himself as a representative of the FARC-EP's Thirtieth Front. The family was also sent letters apparently written by Henry Grosch-Garces that pleaded for money. In one of the last calls, the caller told the family that Grosch-Garces was seriously ill. (44)  A former hostage who claimed that he had been held briefly with Henry Grosch-Garces told Grosch-Garces' family that Grosch-Garces was being held hostage by members of the FARC-EP. The former hostage said he had seen Henry Grosch-Garces in October 1999 and that he had then appeared close to death. The family has received no further information about him. (45)  In the past, the FARC-EP has promised to stop taking hostages. (46) Nevertheless, the FARC-EP recently issued what it termed """"Law 002,"""" which states that anyone in Colombia with assets of U.S. $1 million or more must pay """"taxes"""" to the FARC-EP or risk being taken hostage. (47)Although the numbers of persons currently held hostage by the FARC-EP are not known, País Libre, an independent nongovernmental organization that studies kidnaping, attributed 701 hostage-takings to the FARC-EP in 2000. (48)  Human Rights Watch was not able to investigate the use of the Zone as a location for the detention of hostages seized elsewhere, a problem that has been credibly reported by others, including the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR). (49) According to that office, among those held in 2000 were Andrés Felipe Navas Suárez, three years old, and Clara Olivia Pantoja, five years old, both seized in Bogotá and taken to the Zone until their families paid a ransom for their release. In its annual report, the UNHCHR singled out the Navas and Pantoja kidnapings as particularly abhorrent, converting children into """"object[s] of cruel commerce.""""/ (50)  Attacks on Medical Workers and Health Facilities  Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about the FARC-EP's continuing attacks on medical workers and health facilities, including ambulances. The laws of war clearly prohibit attacks on medical personnel or the wounded in their care, including combatants, or on medical facilities, including ambulances, hospitals and clinics. (51) Indeed, the prohibition extends not only to such formal facilities, but to any structure or vehicle that is marked with the red cross symbol and is being used exclusively at the time to convey or treat the wounded.  In a much publicized incident, paramilitaries killed a seventeen-year-old FARC-EP combatant who was being transported by an ICRC medical team near Apartadó, Antioquia, on October 2, 2000. Ten days later, the FARC-EP committed a similar grave violation when its forces killed a wounded paramilitary who was then under ICRC protection. In both cases, the killings were reportedly sanctioned by the commanders of the units concerned. The ICRC condemned both killings as """"grave breach[es] of international humanitarian law"""" and suspended its medical rescue operations for three months. (52)  FARC-EP guerrillas reportedly conducted a further attack on an ambulance on January 8, 2001 near Anorí, Antioquia. In this case, the ambulance was carrying a pregnant woman in urgent need of medical care. Nevertheless, it was stopped by FARC-EP guerrillas who forced the pregnant woman and her nurse to get out, and then burnt the vehicle. In doing so, they put at risk the lives of both the pregnant woman and her child. Authorities at Anorí's San Juan de Dios Hospital also reported that the FARC-EP had threatened to bomb the hospital, supposedly to protest the fact that medical professionals there treat individuals who may be paramilitaries. (53)  Child Soldiers  Another issue of great concern to Human Rights Watch is the FARC-EP's use of child soldiers. Article 4(3)(c) of Protocol II prohibits parties to an armed conflict from recruiting children under the age of fifteen or allowing them to take part in hostilities. (54)  It should also be noted that Colombia has signed, but not yet ratified, the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. The Optional Protocol raises the age of recruitment and participation in armed conflict from fifteen to eighteen. Article 4 of the Optional Protocol calls on """"armed groups distinct from the armed forces of a State""""--in other words, groups such as the FARC-EP--to cease recruiting or deploying persons under age eighteen. Although the Optional Protocol has not yet entered into force, it reflects a clear international trend in favor of the adoption of age eighteen as a minimum age for participation in armed conflict. Human Rights Watch strongly supports this principle, believing that the use of minors as soldiers is seriously detrimental to their health, welfare, and social development.  In its 1999 annual report, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights explained why keeping minors away from armed conflict is so important:  The use of children and adolescents in armed conflicts places their lives, well-being, and education at great risk. They are forced to use high-caliber weapons. They are required to lay explosives, to kill other children who are considered """"traitors"""" or change their minds, and to participate in kidnapings, surveillance, and bomb intelligence work. In some cases, children as young as eight are used for these perilous tasks. These illegal, perverse practices subject boys, girls, and youths to the inherent risks of combat, to sexual abuse, and to other forms of abusive, brutal, and humiliating treatment. They are drawn into a culture of violence, and their rights to education and to ordinary participation in society are curtailed. (55)  Human Rights Watch's research suggests that the FARC-EP continues to recruit children, including minors under fifteen. Children living in the Zone are particularly vulnerable. During its visit to San Vicente del Caguán, Human Rights Watch interviewed several former child soldiers and relatives of child soldiers. A representative of a group that advocates for the return of minors to their families told Human Rights Watch that she knew the names of over one hundred minors from the San Vicente municipality who belong to the FARC-EP. Many, she said, were under fifteen years old. (56)  A list compiled by the People's Advocate's office, based on family members' complaints about children recruited by the FARC-EP within the Zone in 1999, contained fourteen names, among them the name of an eleven-year-old girl. (57) Human Rights Watch visited several of the families on the list. We were able to confirm that four of those listed had joined the FARC-EP; a fifth had joined but since left, and a sixth, according to family members, had not joined the FARC-EP at all. (58)  None of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch said their children had been forced to join the FARC-EP. Rather, they said that the children had been enticed by promises of a better life. Most were children from impoverished background, with few prospects. Some were from broken homes; one was an orphan. The desperate circumstances these children face spoke volumes about their willingness to enlist with an armed insurgent group.  While children living in the Zone may not be forcibly recruited into the FARC-EP, once integrated into the ranks many are unable to leave. Human Rights Watch was told by relatives of such recruits that minors have to get """"permission"""" from their commanders before they are allowed to leave the FARC-EP, and that this is often difficult to obtain. According to a member of the People's Advocate's staff, who has worked with children previously enlisted in the FARC-EP: """"The guerrillas offer adventure, but when the novelty wears off, [the under age recruits] are prevented from returning home."""" (59)  Human Rights Watch interviewed one thirteen-year-old girl, """"Carmen,"""" who had been living in her cousin's house when two FARC-EP members recruited her. They told her that life would be good if she joined the FARC-EP. Carmen had an unstable family life and a poor relationship with her mother, and agreed to join.  Carmen told Human Rights Watch that out of approximately 130 members of her unit, around fourteen were under fifteen and at least half were younger than eighteen. None, as far as she knew, had been forcibly recruited.  She complained that a FARC-EP commander, age thirty, had pressured her to have sexual relations with him. They had sex several times over a ten-day period. She was given an injection, she said, as a form of birth control. A female FARC-EP member told Carmen that she did not have to have sex with the commander, and Carmen refused his next advance.  Carmen had left the FARC-EP in mid-May 2000, when her mother visited the guerrilla camp and requested her release. Carmen said that she was not anxious to leave the FARC-EP, but that her fear of dying in combat helped her to decide to go home with her mother. (60)  Human Rights Watch also interviewed the mother of a fourteen-year-old girl who had spent three months with the FARC-EP in early 2000. During this period, the mother went persistently from commander to commander trying to obtain information about her daughter's whereabouts and to arrange her return. She wrote numerous letters informing both FARC-EP and Colombian government authorities of the situation.  Finally, in May 2000, the daughter came home. According to the mother, when her daughter returned from the FARC-EP, she was sick and anemic, with an eye infection and huge blisters on her feet. Her daughter also reportedly told her that she had sexual relations with another member of the FARC-EP, and had contracted a venereal """"problem."""" (61)  Another family told Human Rights Watch that their female relative had joined the FARC-EP in May 1999 at age sixteen. She entered the FARC-EP a month after she had started work as a domestic servant. Her family thought she had wanted to escape from her job. Since she had joined, they had spoken to her by phone a few times and had visited her twice. About four months after joining she became disillusioned with her life as a FARC-EP guerrilla, and wanted desperately to leave. But the FARC-EP refused to let her go, telling her that it would be dangerous for her if she were to return to her family. """"She cries when she speaks to us,"""" said her sister. """"She wants to come home."""" (62)  A family living in a rural area in the San Vicente municipality told Human Rights Watch that their son, """"Jorge,"""" had joined the FARC-EP in April 1999 at age fifteen. Jorge hated the army because army soldiers had killed his father when he was five. He had dropped out of school by the time he was recruited by the FARC-EP. According to his family, the FARC had told Jorge that he could spend two months with them to be trained. But after two months he did not return.  Between April and December 1999, his mother told Human Rights Watch, she had seen Jorge three times. """"The last time I saw him was in December,"""" said his mother, who cried when describing the visit. """"He was sick with malaria."""" (63)  At that time, he told her that he was ready to leave the FARC-EP, but that he needed permission to do so. She spoke with one commander to try to obtain such permission. When Human Rights Watch saw her in 2000 she was trying to speak to another commander in the hope that he could arrange the necessary permission.  Gaining this permission to leave the FARC-EP is critical even for children, who risk that group's most severe punishment if they desert. As the UNHCHR pointed out in its report for the year 2000, the FARC-EP applied the same punishment to child deserters as adults. """"The punishment for 'deserters' is the firing squad and this is applied regardless of the age of the deserter.""""/ (64)  FARC-EP commanders have repeatedly stated that they will abide by a minimum recruitment age of fifteen. When Olara Otunnu, the U.N. Secretary-General's special representative for children and armed conflict, met with FARC-EP Commander Raúl Reyes in 1999, Reyes reportedly promised that the FARC-EP would no longer accept or recruit persons under age fifteen. (65)  In June 2000, Commander Carlos Antonio Lozada told Human Rights Watch that the FARC-EP had set fifteen as its minimum recruitment age in 1996. He admitted, however, that """"until recently, this norm was not enforced."""" But, as of April 2000, after Commander Jorge Briceño's firm statements on the matter, it had become """"a norm of obligatory force"""" and would, in the future, be followed. (66)  Commander Briceño reportedly gave a speech at San Vicente del Caguán in April 2000 in which he acknowledged that the FARC-EP had committed """"errors,"""" including the use of child soldiers under age fifteen. According to residents who heard the speech, Briceño promise that the FARC-EP would take steps to remedy matters, such as returning under-age guerrillas to their families. (67)  After this speech, San Vicente residents reported that a number of FARC-EP child combatants were returned to their families, including one girl of twelve. In February 2001, the FARC-EP handed over sixty-two children that they claimed had been combatants to the United Nations Children's Fund. At the same time, the FARC-EP pledged to demobilize 500 more under-age combatants in the months ahead. (68) According to the office of the People's Advocate, however, an estimated 60 percent of FARC-EP fighters are believed to be under fifteen. (69)  Evidence in support of this claim emerged in late 2000 after combat between the FARC-EP and the Colombian Army, in a maneuver that the army labeled """"Operation Berlin."""" Independent observers reported to Human Rights Watch that dozens of children were among the guerrillas registered as killed or captured after government troops intercepted the FARC-EP's """"Arturo Ruiz"""" column outside the Zone near Tibú, Norte de Santander. The Colombian Army announced that thirty-two of those captured were aged seventeen or under, including several younger than fourteen, and a third were females. Of those killed, twenty were said by the army to be children. (70)  Forced Displacement  Forced displacement of civilians is prohibited under article 17 of Protocol II. Unless civilians are required to be moved for purposes of their own safety or due to a clear military imperative, any displacement for reasons related to the conflict is prohibited. It should be noted that forced displacement often occurs as the result of other violations, including killings and threats.  As far as Human Rights Watch is aware, there are no accurate figures on the level of forced displacement from the Zone. It is clear, however, that the FARC-EP's control of the Zone has generated some forced displacement. According to the Consultancy for Human Rights and Forced Displacement (Consultoría para los Derechos Humanos y el Desplazamiento, CODHES), an independent human rights group based in Bogotá, at least 3,700 people leftthe Zone in 1999. (71)  Some fled because they were specifically threatened. Others fled out of fear that their children would be recruited by the FARC-EP or that they would be attacked because the FARC-EP accused them of links with paramilitaries. (72) An informed source based in the town of San Vicente estimated that some 300 persons had fled the San Vicente area because of threats or fear since the Zone's establishment. (73) The People's Advocate has documented several cases of displacement, including that of Bogdan Bujalski, a priest who was based in La Julia, Uribe, and who was forced to flee on September 12, 1999 on the FARC-EP's orders. (74)  Conclusion  Commander Marulanda, as we noted in the introduction to this letter, Human Rights Watch welcomes peace negotiations aimed at ending political violence and international humanitarian law violations in Colombia. But we also believe that immediate action is required by all parties to the conflict to cease the abuses that are described in this letter. Without the necessary attention to upholding the rules of war, it will be all the more difficult to build the confidence and trust necessary between the parties to bring Colombia's long and bloody conflict to an end.  The protections that we have repeatedly referred to should not be subject to negotiation, but are the obligation of the FARC-EP as well as the Colombian government forces and paramilitaries.  Commander Marulanda, as the maximum commander of the FARC-EP, it is your responsibility to ensure that these fundamental principles of international humanitarian law designed to protect civilians and combatants hors de combat are adopted and enforced by the commanders of FARC-EP Blocks (Bloques) and Fronts (Frentes) under your command in Colombia.  Sincerely yours,  José Miguel Vivanco  Executive Director  1.

Rather than protect them from violence, Uzbek authorities routinely force women to remain in violent marriages, blocking their access to divorce and strong-arming them to return to their husbands.  The 57-page report, Sacrificing Women to Save the Family?: State Response to Domestic Violence in Uzbekistan, is based on interviews conducted in May and June 2000 with victims of domestic violence, women's rights activists, along with dozens of lawyers, judges, police, doctors, and government officials at the national, province, district, village, and mahalla (local community government) levels. Researchers focused on rural areas, where more than 60 percent of the population lives.  The report documents the Uzbek government's utter failure to investigate and prosecute domestic violence against women. State policies intended to """"save the family"""" and suppress divorce rates have left women unable to depend on police or other officials for protection from violence and exacerbated their vulnerability to continued beatings in the home.  """"Women simply can't escape the violence,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Beaten, raped, and humiliated by their own husbands, they turn to community authorities to protect their rights. But those officials condone the violence by telling the women that they themselves are to blame, and that they should just go home to their violent husbands.""""  Human Rights Watch found that Uzbek officials rarely criminally prosecute husbands who beat their wives. Instead, local authorities, under orders from central government officials, attempt to reconcile married couples, often sacrificing the women's safety and rights for low divorce statistics.  Batterers enjoy near impunity for their violence, often facing criminal penalties only if their victims commit suicide. In one of the cases documented in the report, a twenty-year-old woman committed suicide by drinking vinegar concentrate.  """"Women suffer doubly,"""" said Andersen, """"first at the hands of their husbands, and then at the hands of the state. This has to stop."""" Human Rights Watch called on the Uzbek government to prosecute cases of domestic violence vigorously, to introduce criminal penalties for stalking and marital rape, and to ensure that women who report domestic violence have ready access to the courts and to social services. Testimonies from domestic violence victims in Uzbekistan follow:  """"Sharofat,"""" a 38 year-old woman living in a rural community, faced violence in her home for seventeen years. Suffering from tuberculosis and abandoned by her husband who had taken a second wife in a religious ceremony, she told Human Rights Watch:  He beat me so hard that I lost my teeth. The beatings happened at least one time each month. He used his fists to beat me. He beat me most severely when I was pregnant...The first time he beat me, and I lost the baby. I was in the hospital. The second time was only a few days before a baby was born, and my face was covered with bruises. He beat me and I went to my parents. My father refused to take me to a doctor. He said, """"What will I say, 'her husband beats her?'""""  Interview with """"Mukhabat,"""" a mother of three, who fled to her parents' home in a rural region in Uzbekistan. She told Human Rights Watch:  I have a bad memory because my...husband beat me on the head. I have no memory anymore. He gave me head trauma. I did not tell anyone that he beat me. I did not go to the mahalla committee. I told my parents, and they went to him and said that he should stop. They asked him to stop. For a year we were happy...then he began to beat me again.  He started to beat me on the head, and I grabbed his hands and tried to stop him. I begged him not to beat me-and not to beat me on the head. He beat me on my head even more with his fists. He beat the left side of my head especially. At that time, my head was spinning, and I saw spots before me. I lost consciousness, and I cannot remember what happened to me. My brother took me to the doctor. They gave me three shots, and then I felt a little better. But I got worse again, and they took me back to the hospital. I told them that my husband beat me. They said that they would call the police. The policeman did not come to the hospital even though the doctor told them what had happened. I was in the hospital for seven days.  Finally, [someone] came and said that someone from the precinct would come and take a longer statement from me. But no one ever came. No one asked me anything.  Often the only criminal sanction against the perpetrators of domestic violence comes when their victims have taken their own lives. Article 103 of the Criminal Code provides for penalties of up to eight years of imprisonment for driving a person to suicide. In the case of a twenty-year-old woman who committed suicide by drinking vinegar concentrate in early June 2000, the policeman investigating the case, whose testimony is given here, asserted that the victim's statements made in hospital before she died would certainly result in a prosecution:  Interview with Police Officer B, June 3, 2000:  The doctors must call the police in these cases. We went to the hospital. The girl told us that she did it on purpose because her husband beat her up and her father-in-law cursed her. One year ago she had a ninth-month miscarriage, and after that, there were many arguments in the family. One day before she drank the vinegar, her father-in-law said to her, """"Give me some tea."""" She brought it to him, but not politely enough. He started to correct her and they got into an argument. Her husband heard this and began to beat her. The next morning at 7:30 or 8:00 a.m. she drank the vinegar. Her husband and his relatives brought her to the hospital. She was six months pregnant at the time. He started to ask her questions at first, when her condition was not so bad. She told us what happened, but then she lost consciousness. The doctors said she would be dead in an hour but it took twenty-four hours for her to die. The investigators have taken over the case and will likely give it to the prosecutor.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan","Women's Rights, Domestic Violence"

In a letter to the King, Human Rights Watch called on the Swaziland government to work with the Constitutional Reform Commission to ensure basic human rights.  On May 4, 2001, the Swaziland Information minister Mntonzima Dlamini invoked the 1968 Proscribed Publications Act and banned """"The Nation"""" magazine and """"The Guardian"""" newspaper. Both were deemed prejudicial or potentially prejudicial to the interests of Swaziland defense, public safety, order, health or morality. On June 22, 2001, after the High Court of Swaziland had ruled this ban illegal, King Mswati issued Royal Decree Number 2, which reinstated the ban and allowed for the confiscation of the publications.  """"The most recent decree appears to use government control over the licensing of publications to censor speech critical of the government, and threatens the existence of the private press,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Journalists and vendors have been harassed and prevented from doing their jobs,"""" Takirambudde added.  In addition, the Royal Decree eliminates bail for a wide range of crimes, including holding unlawful public demonstrations, and gives the Justice Minister the power to hire and fire judges at will. This violates the rights of liberty and security of person and undercuts judicial independence and the rule of law. It paves the way for the government to arrest and detain critics of the government for long periods. Including this in the decree further undermines the legitimate role of the judiciary by revoking a 1993 court order making the elimination of bail unconstitutional.  Human Rights Watch urged King Mswati and his government to work with the Constitutional Reform Commission, as well as members of civil society, to rectify this situation to protect freedom of expression, association and a fair and impartial judiciary.  Human Rights Watch also called on King Mswati to sign and ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure basic human rights to all Swaziland citizens.

But the group noted that Pinochet's arrest and prosecution have represented a permanent advance in the cause of human rights. """"It's a terrible disappointment for Pinochet's thousands of victims that he may never have to face trial,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"But the fact that he was arrested in England, that he was charged in Chile despite his self-amnesty, and that the truth about his personal involvement in atrocities was revealed, has advanced the cause of justice in Chile and the world. The Pinochet case marks the beginning of the end of impunity for the worst state crimes.""""  Pinochet's London arrest helped to establish the principle that grave human rights crimes are subject to """"universal jurisdiction"""" and can be prosecuted anywhere in the world. Two rulings by the House of Lords found that Pinochet was not immune from prosecution even though he was head of state at the time the crimes were committed. Once Pinochet was returned to Chile, ostensibly on health grounds, the myth of his immunity had been totally shattered. The reinvigorated Chilean courts skirted the 1978 military self-amnesty by ruling that prosecutions of ongoing """"disappearances"""" are not barred, because the crime continues as long as the fate of the victim is concealed. Pinochet could thus be prosecuted for his role in the """"Caravan of Death,"""" a helicopter-borne military group that executed and """"disappeared"""" seventy-five political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup. In a historic ruling last August, the Chilean Supreme Court lifted Pinochet's senatorial immunity. Details about Pinochet's personal involvement in the """"Caravan of Death"""" came out for the first time.  The Appeals Court today ruled that Pinochet was not competent to stand trial. The decision effectively marks the end of the Pinochet trial. Although one avenue of appeal is left to lawyers representing the victims, chances of success are considered to be minimal.  In January this year, a team of six experts established unanimously that Pinochet suffered from """"light to moderate"""" dementia caused by the after effects of a series of minor strokes, but did not find that he was insane or mentally incapacitated. The medical evidence was gathered in four days of tests done between January 10 and 13, 2001, by six psychiatrists and neurologists attached to the government Medical Legal Service and the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile. They were observed by one independent expert chosen by either side. The procedures appeared to be thorough, professional, and impartial.  The experts disagreed on whether Pinochet's mental difficulties were serious enough to affect his ability to undergo the rigors of a trial. Trial in Chile is largely a written procedure and does not involve the public appearance of the defendant in court. After deposing Pinochet in person and studying the medical reports, the investigating judge, Juan GuzmanTapia, concluded that his condition was not serious enought to meet the high threshold for exemption required by Chilean law (madness or dementia). Today, the three-person Appeals Court panel ruled, by two votes to one, that his condition did meet that threshold. The difference between Judge Guzman's conclusions and those of the Appeals Court appears to be based on their interpretations of the term """"dementia"""" in Chilean law.  """"The criteria that should have been applied are whether Pinochet is fit enough to understand the charges and to instruct his defense; whether he possesses reasonable powers of recall; and whether his cognitive and reasoning capacities are sound,"""" said Vivanco. """"The indications are that at present Pinochet could be tried without a violation of due process. If the trial continued and his condition deteriorated, his lawyers would have been entitled to ask the judge to halt the trial at any time.""""  """"Pinochet will probably end his years at home, but would-be dictators should pause and ponder on his destiny,"""" said Vivanco. """"His arrest in London changed history. Now history will give the final verdict on his rule.""""","Americas, Chile","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/08/colombia-rebel-abuses-worsening","Colombia- Rebel Abuses Worsening","Colombia: Rebel Abuses Worsening","","07/08/2001","The main rebel group in Colombia must act decisively to reverse a worsening record of abuses against civilians, Human Rights Watch said in a letter to rebel commander Manuel Marulanda, the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FuerzasArmadas Revolucionarias de  Colombia-Ejército del Pueblo, FARC-EP).  In a twenty-page letter to Manuel Marulanda, the commander-in-chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia-Ej?cito del Pueblo, FARC-EP), Human Rights Watch described the FARC-EP's responsibility for serious abuses, including killings of civilians, hostage-taking, the use of child soldiers, grossly unfair trials, the cruel and inhuman treatment of captured combatants, and the forced displacement of civilians. Human Rights Watch also cited the FARC-EP's continuing use of prohibited weapons, including gas cylinder bombs, and its attacks against medical workers and facilities in blatant disregard of international humanitarian law.  In particular, the FARC-EP has committed abductions and extrajudicial executions in the zone ceded to its control for talks with the government (zona de despeje). The Colombian government granted the Switzerland-sized area to the FARC-EP in November 1998 to further peace talks. """"The FARC-EP has an appalling record of abuses,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"As top commander of the FARC-EP, Manuel Marulanda is the one responsible for taking the steps necessary to adopt and enforce international legal norms. That is why we addressed him directly.""""  Formally established in 1964, the FARC-EP is Colombia's oldest and largest rebel group. Although estimates differ, the FARC-EP is believed to have over 15,000 members and is active throughout Colombia. Marulanda was one of the original founders and now presides over the General Secretariat, the group's seven-member governing body.  Human Rights Watch conducted a mission to the Zone in May and June of 2000. There, Human Rights Watch held meetings with several high-level FARC-EP commanders who disputed the applicability of international humanitarian law principles to the conduct of the FARC-EP. In its letter to Marulanda, Human Rights Watch explained that the relevant international norms are not subject to negotiation, but must be upheld by each of the parties to the armed conflict in Colombia.  Human Rights Watch directly investigated and confirmed that individuals in the Zone were subject to a wide range of abuses, including abductions followed by suspected extrajudicial executions. In 2000, human rights groups reported that the FARC-EP killed 496 civilians nationwide, many accused of being paramilitary or government sympathizers. The rights organization also received information about abuses committed by the FARC-EP outside the Zone.  An estimated 90,000 inhabitants live in the Zone. The Colombian government did not consult them before ceding control over the territory to the rebels. Nor were any special mechanisms put in place to protect their rights following the withdrawal of Colombian police and military forces, as well as judges and prosecutors.  In February 2001, President Andre Pastrana extended the FARC-EP's control of the Zone for an additional eight months. Given the vulnerability of the Zone's civilian population, Human Rights Watch believes that the government and FARC-EP should establish protections for the rights of residents of the Zone for the remainder of its existence.  Human Rights Watch applauded the FARC-EP's recent release of captured members of the Colombian military and police, but noted that many reported being held in abusive conditions.","Americas, Colombia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/08/icc-alliance-justice","The ICC- An Alliance for Justice","The ICC: An Alliance for Justice","By Tom Malinowski","07/08/2001","At the end of a long critique (The Court of No Resort,"""" op-ed, July 2, 1001), Fred Hiatt correctly counsels the Bush administration to work to shape the soon-to-be created International Criminal Court (ICC) instead of launching a """"foolishly counterproductive"""" campaign against it.  The wisdom of that counclusion would be even more apparent had he not repeated so many misconceptions about the ICC along the way.    His fear is that the ICC will function """"without any political oversight,"""" except from a rogues' gallery of undemocratic states. """"Think U.N. General Assembly; think Sudan and Cuba voting themselves onto the U.N. Human Rights Commission,"""" he writes.   In fact, the ICC will answer to an assembly of member states with the power to remove its judges and prosecutor by a simple vote. Highly abusive governments can indeed join this assembly, but only if they ratify the ICC treaty. And they have an incentive not to ratify. For if they do, they will grant the court jurisdiction over crimes committed on their territory. If not, the court will have such jurisdiction only with U.N. Security Council authorization.   Joining the U.N. Human Rights Commission is unfortunately a risk-free proposition for the Sudans of the world. Joining the ICC would expose their leaders to prosecution. For this reason, countries such as China, Cuba, North Korea, Iraq, Libya, Burma, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam refused to sign the ICC treaty, which is being ratified primarily by democracies. The ICC will include every member of the European Union and almost every major U.S. ally. Despots will be evading it, not employing it.   As for the danger of political prosecutions of Americans, it certainly exists in a world in which many resent America's power. But those targeting the United States are not likely to make the ICC their instrument. The ICC will cover only the most egregious international crimes, defined in ways corresponding closely to the U.S. military code of justice. It will have no independent arrest authority. For alleged crimes on U.S. soil, the ICC will have jurisdiction only if the United States ratifies the treaty, which is unlikely until the court has a track record. If a U.S. service member overseas were accused of a war crime, the ICC would be forbidden to exercise jurisdiction if the United States launched a good-faith investigation, something the United States is committed to do as a matter of policy.   Hiatt claims that even the """"potential"""" vulnerability to prosecution """"will discourage the U.S. government from sending troops to places such as Kosovo."""" Yet the United States has sent thousands of troops to Kosovo, where they are potentially subject to the jurisdiction of the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal.   The Yugoslav court, which Hiatt rightly praises, has worked responsibly with fewer restraints than the ICC and no requirement to respect the decisions of national courts. Ironically, the international tribunal Hiatt likes most is the one least deferential to national sovereignty; the one he likes least -- the ICC -- will be the most deferential.   What about Israel? Hiatt is concerned that Human Rights Watch backs an investigation of Ariel Sharon for massacres in Lebanon, though even he concedes that """"it's fair to question Sharon's role."""" But that investigation is being conducted by a Belgian court. The ICC cannot touch Sharon for events of 19 years ago, because it can prosecute crimes committed only after its creation. Future actions on Israeli or Palestinian territory will be covered only if the ICC treaty is ratified by Israel or by a broadly recognized Palestinian state. That will not happen until after a peace agreement, in which case the likelihood of Israeli military action against Palestinians greatly diminishes.   So how will the ICC be used? The Security Council might someday approve investigations of egregious violators such as Sudan, even if they don't join the court. Thugs, like Liberia's Charles Taylor, may be exposed for atrocities committed on the territory of neighbors who ratify to protect themselves. Democracies such as Mali have ratified the ICC treaty as an insurance against antidemocratic coups.   But the most important feature of the ICC may well be its limitations. It will not be a rogue court. Nor will it be the final answer to the problem of impunity for war crimes. It will represent simply one step down a road the United States should continue to travel with its allies, as Hiatt ultimately suggests: toward a system of justice built not to settle scores, but to affirm the humanity of victims who too often are forgotten.","United States, Global","International Justice, International Criminal Court"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/08/statement-un-conference-small-arms-trafficking-new-york","Statement to the UN Conference on Small Arms Trafficking New York","Statement to the U.N. Conference on Small Arms Trafficking, New York","Delivered by Joost R. Hiltermann, Director","07/08/2001","Good afternoon. In about an hour, government delegates will convene to tackle an issue of pressing global concern but so far neglected: That of the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons. The delegates will talk today and over the next two weeks, but compared to what is needed, they will accomplish very little. The reason for this is simple: Governments have chosen to tackle only one slice of the problem, the illicit trade in small arms. And they have chosen to deal with it as a security question, not the grave humanitarian problem that it really is. By thus limiting the conference agenda and by expressly warning that they will not agree to any sort of binding outcome, governments are engaging in an exercise that will yield, at most, a handful of technical fixes, or perhaps only a promise to start discussing such technical fixes some time in the future. For us in the human rights community, this would be a bitter disappointment. To Human Rights Watch, the uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons is a matter of great human rights concern. It is the deliberate misuse of weapons that often gives rise to serious violations of human rights-in time of peace as well as war. In fact, the misuse of arms by state security forces in domestic law-enforcement situations may prompt opposition groups to seek to arm themselves as well, leading to a deterioration in the security situation and worsening violations of human rights, and possibly culminating in civil war and its attendant crimes against humanity, even genocide. The supply of weapons to forces-be they state security forces or nonstate actors like guerrilla groups-that commit gross violations of human rights or the laws of war may involve an act of complicity in these abuses, and is therefore a human rights concern. From a human rights perspective, we seek to identify, prosecute, and punish not only the perpetrators of human rights crimes, but also the enablers-the accessories to these crimes: the arms manufacturers, exporters, brokers, and carriers. Our Objectives at the Conference Our objectives at this conference are threefold: 1. We are here to challenge the attempt by governments to limit the debate to the illicit trade-the trafficking in arms-to the exclusion of the licit trade. The dichotomy between the licit and the illicit trade is a false one. It is a fact that most illicitly-traded weapons start out being traded legally before slipping into the black market. By separating out the illicit trade and devising solutions that fail to take into consideration this basic fact, governments are engaging in an exercise in futility. It is akin to trying to cure a disease without seeking to eliminate the circumstances that gave rise to it in the first place. We also must challenge states' definition of what constitutes """"illicit."""" When states use the term """"illicit,"""" they tend to mean: """"in violation of national civil and criminal law."""" They rarely, if ever, mean: """"in violation of our obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law."""" The transfer of weapons is prohibited in those cases in which it is foreseeable that the weapons will be used by the recipient in violation of human rights, or in cases in which an international arms embargo exists. 2. We are also here to challenge the attempt to devise strictly technical fixes (for example, marking, tracing, and throwing money at upgrading customs capabilities) to what is at heart a political problem. While such technical solutions should play a part in a comprehensive approach to the problem, what must come first is an explicit recognition that governments bear overall responsibility for the global trade in arms-be it by acts of commission or acts of omission. 3. Finally, we are here to challenge states' preoccupation with the proliferation dimension of the small arms question with little regard for the humanitarian impact. Governmental experts involved in the process have hailed typically from the arms control sections of their foreign and defense ministries. While it is fair for states to have security concerns about small arms proliferation, if we allow the debate to be confined to those quarters we will never succeed in addressing the real problems and find effective and lasting solutions. We would never have achieved a landmark treaty banning antipersonnel landmines if we had left the negotiations to the arms control folks. Instead, we must put the spotlight on the humanitarian impact of the uncontrolled spread of small arms, and on making states' human rights obligations central to the effort to curb small arms proliferation. The common denominator underlying this approach is the need for governments to take responsibility for the global arms trade, and this responsibility takes many forms: To have a foreign policy that fully incorporates human rights criteria in arms transfer decisions. To prevent legally traded arms from slipping into the black market (by securing stockpiles and controlling brokers). To crack down on arms traffickers by enforcing the law on illegal actions by their nationals or taking place on their territories. To implement and enforce international arms embargoes. To prosecute and punish violators of national and international laws regulating the arms trade, as well as of international human rights and humanitarian law. To be transparent in arms trading (via regular submissions to registers; marking and tracing; etc.). Case Study: Ukrainian Arms to Sierra Leone I will now draw on our research in Eastern Europe and West Africa to illustrate these various dimensions of """"governmental responsibility"""" for the arms trade. As you know, Sierra Leone has been the scene of a vicious war fought by a rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front, which has visited horrendous atrocities on its civilian victims. The rebels' signature method has been the amputation of limbs, but they have also carried out widespread killings, rapes, and abductions, and they have used child soldiers on a large scale. Nothing about these horrific abuses was new or unknown in March 1999, when, according to an ECOMOG commander, a Ukrainian-registered cargo plane delivered 68 tons of weapons and ammunition to Ouagadougou, the capital of Burkina Faso, for on-shipment to the RUF via Liberia. In Ouagadougou, the commander claimed, the plane parked in the airport's VIP terminal. There the cargo was transferred for shipment by smaller aircraft to Liberia and, once in Liberia, the weapons were transported by land to the RUF inside Sierra Leone. The government of Ukraine promptly denied it was in the business of arming the RUF, claiming instead that one of its state-owned arms export companies had sold the weapons legally to the Burkinabe ministry of defense, which had duly issued an end-user certificate showing the weapons were to stay in Burkina Faso. A UN investigation last year broadly supported the allegations made by the ECOMOG commander. What we have here is a case in which the Ukrainian government employed easy-to-forge documents to prove that its state-owned company had stayed within the law in selling to Burkina Faso weapons that ended up in the hands of the RUF in violation of not one but two UN arms embargoes (against the RUF and against Liberia). But this is also a case in which the UN dropped its own investigation into the matter in July 1999 to protect the peace process in Sierra Leone, where the RUF had just signed what turned out to be a flawed and ill-fated peace deal with the government. To add insult to injury, the Ukrainian ambassador to the UN claimed last month that neither his government nor its firms and individuals have supplied weapons in violation of UN arms embargoes, and that UN investigators have validated that claim. The fact is, however, that a UN panel on Sierra Leone last year deplored the fact that Ukraine had shown neither restraint nor due care and diligence in its arms dealing, making Ukraine a point of origin for illegally trafficked weapons. Moreover, Ukrainian nationals and private firms have been linked repeatedly to illicit arms trading. The UN panel on embargo violations in Angola found that Ukrainian nationals are involved in ferrying arms to Angolan rebels and brokering arms deals, and that Ukrainian air transport companies are suspected of involvement in the illegal trade. The Ukrainian government's efforts to distance itself from such deals only point to the need to emphasize government responsibility for controlling the arms trade: its own and that of private brokers and shipping agents under its jurisdiction. The Golden Rule This brings us back to the conference that is starting here in New York today. As the example shows, active collusion between irresponsible governments and unscrupulous international arms brokers serves to fuel humanitarian suffering in open defiance of UN arms embargoes, which are further undermined by the UN's own lack of interest in properly enforcing them. This collusion, which goes to the heart of the problem of the global trade in arms, is not on the agenda for the conference, and neither is the role of the UN and its member states. What remains is to map out a strategy for the future. At Human Rights Watch we are committed to monitoring governments' adherence to what we call the Golden Rule: No weapons for human rights abuse. This humanitarian imperative-to reduce human suffering by curbing the transfer of arms to human rights abusers-derives not merely from a compassion for the innocent victims of violence but is based on the universally recognized obligation of states to comply with the international instruments they have signed and ratified and that should therefore govern their conduct-the rules of international human rights and humanitarian law. In short, we'll be watching! That's one. Two, the bottom line is that governments will do nothing if they do not perceive a significant self-interest or if they can get away with doing nothing. It's that finicky little problem of political will-or the absence thereof. The role of NGOs will be critical in helping governments find the political will to effect positive change. In many ways, the current UN process was designed to limit serious pressure from civil society. Some states have been quite explicit about their desire not to see a repeat of the NGO-led Ottawa process that gave rise to the treaty banning antipersonnel landmines. Of course, these governments have been helped by the fact that the small arms issue is so much less focused and discreet than the landmines issue. So there is an extra challenge here for NGOs to forge a common vision and put real pressure on governments. The attempt by the new humanitarian coalition to highlight both the humanitarian impact from the uncontrolled spread of small arms and states' obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law is therefore a very important and positive one. During the next two weeks, we will remind governments that their obligations under international law will not end with the conclusion of this conference, and that in the years to come, whatever the outcome of these current proceedings, we will be there to watch, to protest, and to protect. Thank you.","Global","Arms, United Nations"

Secretary-General Kofi Annan","07/05/2001","Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch write to urge full support for the dispatch of international human rights monitors to the West Bank and Gaza Strip territories under the control of the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. These observers should include persons with the expertise and training to monitor the compliance of the parties with international human rights and humanitarian law.  The clashes between Israelis and Palestinians since October 2000 have been marked by systematic violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. Civilians have been the main victims of the violence, and an immediate priority must be to bring such violations to an end. At least 470 Palestinians have been killed, most of them unlawfully by Israeli security forces when their lives and the lives of others were not in danger. More than 120 Israelis have been killed, most of them civilians deliberately targeted by armed groups and individuals. The death toll includes more than 130 children.  Investigations by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented human rights and humanitarian law violations by both sides. Based on these findings, both organizations have advocated the dispatch of international observers to monitor compliance with human rights and international humanitarian law as a means of enhancing protection for civilians. Similar findings and recommendations were made by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry and in an 11 April 2001 resolution of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights.  The Report of the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee (""""the Mitchell Report""""), in its introduction, stressed that """"the path to peace, justice and security"""" required that """"agreed commitments be implemented, international law respected, and human rights protected."""" The committee made a number of recommendations similar to those already made by our organizations, recommendations that would lead to greater protection for civilian victims of the violence. The committee urged, for instance, that the Israeli authorities """"adopt and enforce policies and procedures encouraging non-lethal responses to unarmed demonstrators,"""" reinstate investigations into Palestinian deaths caused by actions of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), and lift restrictions on freedom of movement. The committee urged the Palestinian Authority to establish a """"clear and unchallenged chain of command for armed personnel operating under its authority,"""" institute and enforce effective standards of conduct and accountability, and prevent gunmen from firing on Israeli civilian populated areas or on IDF positions from Palestinian populated areas.  The Palestinian Authority and Israel have accepted the report of the Sharm el-Sheikh Committee. On 13 June, Israel and the Palestinian Authority agreed to the cease-fire plan negotiated by George Tenet, director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.  While the partially-implemented cease-fire has reduced the daily toll of Palestinian and Israeli civilian casualties, serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations have continued. Since 13 June:  At least twelve Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces in circumstances that suggest their killings may have been unlawful. Two of those were killed during demonstrations when lives of others were reportedly not in danger. One was killed at a checkpoint. Four were killed in circumstances that suggest possible extra judicial execution.  Seven Israelis, including four civilians, have been killed. The three civilians and one soldier were apparently killed in drive-by shootings by armed groups or individuals.  At least 28 Palestinian homes have been demolished by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) since the 13 June cease-fire. Some 20 were destroyed on 23 June by bulldozers in the Barahmeh area of Rafah, apparently as a collective punishment shortly after two Israeli soldiers were killed elsewhere in the Gaza Strip; no time was given to the residents to remove their possessions.  Continued and renewed closures of the Palestinian areas in Gaza and the West Bank arbitrarily restrict the right of Palestinians to freedom of movement out of and between enclaves, with grave humanitarian consequences, impeding access to health services and education as well as the provision of basic civilian necessities, including food, medicines, and fuel.  Many Palestinian areas bordering on Jewish settlements have been bombarded, usually in excessive and disproportionate response by the IDF to small arms or mortar fire from Palestinians. Scores of Palestinian homes have been made uninhabitable, and surrounding areas have become """"no-go"""" areas, where Palestinians have been targeted and in some cases killed by the IDF. The Tenet cease-fire plan calls for the revival of joint security committees of Israeli, Palestinian and US security officials and the reactivation of Israeli-Palestinian District Coordination Offices. We are acutely aware that during periods of clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli Defence Forces since the end of September 2000, the level of cooperation within these joint security committees quickly decreased. For much of the past nine months they have not met, and the meetings held since the announcement of the Tenet cease-fire plan have been intermittent. Furthermore, the extent of continued serious human rights and international humanitarian law violations over these past several weeks, including killings, house demolitions, and closures listed above, give cause for concern at the ability of this security cooperation in and of itself to bring an end to these serious and systematic human rights violations.  Secretary of State Colin Powell, at a press briefing following a meeting on 28 June with Palestinian President Yasir Arafat, said, """"I think as we get into the confidence building measures, the confidence building phase, there will be a need for monitors, observers, to see what is happening on the ground, to serve as interlocutors, to go to points of friction and make an independent observation of what has happened."""" Subsequently, during a press briefing with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, Secretary Powell said, """"Earlier today, when we were talking about monitors and observers, I had it in the context of what the two sides might decide to do within their own resources or whatever resources might be appropriate by mutual agreement, not some outside group of forces coming in.""""  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch believe that independent observation, in Secretary Powell's words, is essential, and this requires that the monitoring presence have an international dimension. Such a presence would appreciably enhance and build on existing joint efforts by the two parties, such as the joint security committee meetings, to bring the violence to an end. We recognize that the deployment of international monitors can only happen with the agreement of all parties to the conflict, and we therefore call on Israel and the Palestinian Authority, as well as states with influence with the parties, to take the steps necessary for the deployment of international human rights monitors in the zones of conflict.  The human rights monitoring mechanism might take the form of an international presence mandated by the United Nations Security Council. Alternatively its composition might come from states that may make available their good offices in this regard. The monitors would have appropriate monitoring skills, experience, and resources, and function in accordance with U.N. standards. They would be charged with monitoring the observance by the parties to the conflict of both international human rights and humanitarian law standards. Because the areas that are the site of continuing clashes are under military occupation, the policies of the occupying authority must comply with Geneva Convention IV Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. However, the application of international humanitarian law does not preempt the application of core international human rights standards, particularly non-derogable rights. In situations of this complexity, both legal regimes should complement and reinforce each other in order to provide maximum protection to individuals.  We note that the Temporary International Presence in Hebron (TIPH) has been deployed continuously in the city since 1997, but its lack of a public reporting mandate has limited its capacity to affect significantly the extensive ongoing human rights violations in that city. The deployment in recent weeks of European Union technical advisers to Beit Jala appears to have contributed to greatly reduced number of incidents of Palestinian gunfire on Gilo, a heavily populated Israeli Jewish settlement, and Israeli military shelling of Beit Jala neighborhoods. The mandate of the monitoring mechanism we call for here should include reporting to the public as well as to the responsible authorities on violations of human rights and international humanitarian law.  Impartial, experienced, and independent international observers offer a practical means to observe, and investigate and report on, respect for human rights and international humanitarian law standards by government authorities or armed groups. By their presence at points of friction and through their reporting they will enhance protection to both Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  Fact-finding and reporting  The occurrence of human rights violations frequently involve claims and counter-claims concerning the specific incidents. Given the lack of past investigations, and in the present atmosphere of distrust and mutual accusation, it is imperative to gather information that is accurate and impartial. International observers should monitor continuously points where demonstrations and clashes occur, as well as other friction points, so as to observe and report, for example, on whether demonstrators were armed, whether the lives of others were in danger, whether Palestinian officials made efforts to halt armed Palestinian attacks on Israeli civilians, and whether Israeli security forces handled relevant situations in accordance with basic international standards governing the use of force. A key feature of the clashes that erupted in late September has been the failure to conduct proper investigations of alleged unlawful killings. The mandate of the monitoring force should include the task of pressing the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, to initiate prompt investigations that are independent, impartial and transparent, and to discipline and/or bring to justice persons suspected of being responsible for such killings. Protection  Many Palestinians are extremely fearful of passing Israeli checkpoints. At such checkpoints Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers; Palestinians have also been prevented from reaching urgent medical care and deaths have resulted in some cases. Impartial international human rights monitors can serve as a deterrent to unlawful behavior and can contribute to combating the lack of accountability and impunity that characterizes the situation today.  The presence at key locations of international human rights monitors may help to deter attacks on roads and improve security for people travelling in areas where drivers of car with a """"wrong"""" license plate is in danger of being attacked by armed individuals or militias. Such observers can also press the relevant authorities to investigate and bring to justice persons responsible for such attacks.  International human rights observers should be mandated to monitor, on an ongoing basis, the behavior of security forces and armed individuals or groups in areas that have been declared or effectively become """"no-go"""" or """"free fire"""" zones. International monitors must be independent, but with access to the decision-makers of each side. They should have human rights and international humanitarian law expertise and appropriate experience and training. They should have the right to travel wherever necessary in order to carry out their duties. They should report their findings, including human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law by either side, to the joint Israeli, Palestinian and US security committees, the mandating body or governments, and other responsible officials designated by the parties. At regular intervals, and not less frequently than every month, the findings of the monitors should be made public, along with a report on the steps taken by the parties to correct policies and actions responsible for human rights violations, and to investigate and discipline or bring to justice individuals responsible for those violations.  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reiterate our view, in concurrence with the view of the Sharm el-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee, that peace and security must be built on respect for international law and the protection of human rights. In addressing the question of an international monitoring presence, the committee correctly noted that such a step required the agreement and support of all parties to the conflict.  We believe that such an initiative is long overdue, and we therefore call on the government of Israel as well as the Palestinian Authority to declare their readiness to cooperate with such an initiative.  We further call on the international community, and especially those states whose influence with the parties is greatest, to endorse publicly such an initiative. In particular, the governments of the U.S. and European Union members states should take immediate steps to implement this initiative, either in the form of a U.N. Security Council resolution or as a project of states deeply engaged in efforts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the parties.

Eyewitnesses from several  villages alleged torture, ill-treatment, and extortion of the detainees. In at least two villages, Sernovodsk and Alkhan-Kala, Russian forces went from house to house rounding up men without so much as conducting an initial passport check, villagers told Human Rights Watch. During Tuesday's sweep operation in Sernovodsk, prompted by a bomb explosion the previous day, hundreds of men were detained; the Alkhan-Kala sweep, which aimed to seize rebel leader Arbi Baraev, took place from June 19 to 25.  """"The level of arbitrary detentions we are seeing now is unprecedented,"""" said Elizabeth Andersen, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"This amounts to collective punishment and is absolutely unacceptable.""""  Human Rights Watch researchers learned of other sweep operations in the last ten days in Assinovskaia, Kurchaloi, Mairtup, Starye Atagi, as well as two districts of Grozny. Many Chechens feared similar sweeps in other villages as well.  The new-style sweeps in Sernovodsk and Assinovskaia have already led to a new influx of fleeing civilians into Ingushetia. Human Rights Watch researchers in the region noticed an increase in the number of displaced Chechens in camps close to the Chechen-Ingush administrative border. Many civilians from Sernovodsk-including many who stayed in a camp for displaced people in the town-walked across the hills into Ingushetia Tuesday night, saying they feared a further sweep on Wednesday.  As of Thursday, it was unclear whether the new arrivals would stay in Ingushetia or return once the sweep in Sernovodsk ends. Human Rights Watch is concerned that those who wish to stay in Ingushetia may face problems registering with the Ingush authorities, as the Russian government ordered an end to registration of new displaced persons from Chechnya starting April 1, 2001.  On Thursday, the heads of administration of Sernovodsk and Assinovskaia villages resigned in protest over what they said were """"unreasonably severe"""" sweep operations. That same day, the deputy head of the Kurchaloi district administration resigned for the same reason.  The sweep operation in Sernovodsk started early in the morning of July 2, apparently in response to a bomb explosion that killed several federal soldiers. """"Aset A."""" (not the woman's real name), a middle-aged school teacher, told Human Rights Watch she heard tanks moving into the village overnight. By around 6:00 a.m., helicopters dropped off special forces. By 10:00 a.m., the troops started conducting house-to-house checks and detained most males they encountered. Aset A. said that her nineteen-year-old nephew and at least two of her students, aged fourteen or fifteen, were among those detained. All detainees were taken to a field outside Sernovodsk.  Several witnesses reported that many of those detained were tortured or ill-treated. Aset A. said her nephew was beaten while in custody. She told Human Rights Watch that when she saw him after his release, he had one black eye and his torso and legs were severely bruised. He also told her that he had been tortured with electroshock. """"Ramzan R."""" (not the man's real name) told Human Rights Watch that he and many others were taken into special cars, where they were tortured. He said he had been beaten and subjected to electroshock.  The troops released the majority of the detainees in the early hours of July 3. Several witnesses said soldiers forced detainees to sign statements saying they had no complaints about their treatment in detention. Some detainees were transferred to the temporary police station in Achkhoi-Martan. Human Rights Watch has not been able to confirm their number or the charges against them.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Guinean security personnel and civilians regularly harass refugees near their camps or as they move through the country to safer areas. Checkpoints along the roads are particularly dangerous locations, where refugees are often subjected to arbitrary strip searches, beatings, sexual assault and extortion. In the report, """"Refugees Still at Risk: Continuing Refugee Protection Concerns in Guinea,"""" Human Rights Watch has also documented the cases of refugees who were tortured or beaten to death while detained in Forecariah Prison, southeast of Conakry.  """"These people are fleeing terrible civil wars, and they should not be subjected to more abuse when they reach their place of refuge,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is not simply a moral argument, it is a fact of international law. Guinea must live up to its responsibilities.""""  For a decade, Guinea has hosted several hundred thousand refugees who have fled the conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone. This is one of the largest refugee populations in Africa, surpassed only by that in Tanzania, which is a bigger country.  More than 40,000 of these refugees have recently been relocated from embattled border areas to camps in the interior of Guinea. Despite this improvement, the refugees' long-term safety is still under threat, Human Rights Watch said.  Refugees have very little information about the situation in the new camps, on the roads in Guinea or in their home countries, and have great difficulty in accessing and obtaining the help of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). The number of UNHCR protection officers in the rest of Guinea is insufficient and subject to a high turnover.  Many refugees have been arrested for such arbitrary reasons as their age and size and have been held for periods up to several weeks in Guinean detention facilities in Forecariah, Gu?k?ou, and Kissidougou, often without charge. Still more refugees are vulnerable to all of these abuses because no valid refugee identification cards have been distributed by the Guinean government.  Many Guineans blame the refugees for the conflict at the border. While Guinea does have legitimate concerns about the threat to national security posed by rebel infiltration from Sierra Leone and Liberia, these concerns do not excuse the harassment and physical threats that cause refugees in Guinea to live in fear, Human Rights Watch said.  Since September 2000, a combination of Sierra Leonean Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels and armed Liberian forces have repeatedly attacked and burned refugee camps and Guinean villages along the border, killing, injuring, abducting, and forcing their residents to flee. The Liberian government has also launched cross-border attacks, accusing Guinea of providing support and hosting a Liberian rebel group, the Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD).  In September 2000, Guinean President Lansana Conte made an inflammatory speech indiscriminately blaming refugees for the border destabilization and calling on the Guinean population to defend their country against foreign invasions. Police, soldiers and civilian militias launched widespread violence against thousands of refugees in the camps and in the capital Conakry following this speech. In the months that followed, a number of cross-border attacks into Guinea by Liberian forces and Sierra Leonean RUF rebels resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Guineans and refugees, and displaced thousands of refugees and local residents.  Refugees in Guinea are presented with choices that all pose risks to their long-term personal safety. They can remain in the border area which is under attack; move to new camps within Guinea, where they may be more vulnerable to hostility from the local population; or return to Sierra Leone or Liberia, which both remain unstable.  Recently, UNHCR in Guinea has focused on the relocation of refugees away from the border area. The operation was completed in May 2001, but many refugees remain in the border areas where they are now entirely without international protection. Donor governments have also failed to provide the needed funding for assistance and protection of refugees in Guinea.  Human Rights Watch welcomed the relocation process as a major step towards assuring refugee protection, but urged UNHCR to pay closer attention to abuses being committed against refugees by the Guinean authorities and civilians hostile to the refugee presence.","Africa, Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone","Refugees and Migrants"

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/03/egypt-emergency-court-trials-homosexuality-suspects","Egypt- Emergency Court Trials for Homosexuality Suspects","Egypt: Emergency Court Trials for Homosexuality Suspects","","07/03/2001","Two international human rights groups today deplored the Egyptian government'sdecision to prosecute fifty-two men before an Emergency State Security Court on charges of """"obscene behavior"""" and expressing """"contempt for religion."""" An Egyptian prosecutor will review their continued detention  this week. In a joint statement, Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) condemned the men's detention since May 11, when they were arrested apparently on suspicion that they had engaged in consensual homosexual behavior, and expressed grave concern that they may have been subjected to torture in detention.  """"Egyptian law does not outlaw homosexuality, but these men are being held on charges of violating public morals,"""" said Scott Long, IGLHRC's Policy Director. """"They are really being punished for exercising their basic rights to free expression and free association.""""  The men were initially held incommunicado, unable to contact lawyers or relatives, and some were reportedly beaten and ill-treated. The procedures of the Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanors, established under Egypt's state of emergency legislation, do not comport with international fair trial standards. If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from three months to nine years. There is no right of appeal to a higher tribunal.  """"This case exhibits some of the worst features of Egypt's justice system - prolonged and incommunicado detention and emergency proceedings on spurious charges,"""" said Hanny Megally director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch.  Background  Fifty-two Egyptian men arrested in the second week of May, apparently on suspicion that they engaged in consensual homosexual behavior, are to be tried before the Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanours on charges of committing """"obscene behaviour"""" (al-fujur - which can include adultery, fornication and sodomy), and with """"contempt for religion"""". The decision to refer the case to trial was announced by Prosecutor General Maher Abdel Wahed at a press conference held on June 28. Charges against three others arrested in the same case were dropped. No date has been set for the trial.  Egyptian law does not expressly criminalize homosexual acts. However, the obscenity charge is being brought under Article 9(c) of Law No. 10 of 1961 on the Combat of Prostitution. This law provides a custodial sentence of between three months and three years for """"obscene behaviour"""" as well as prostitution. The """"contempt for religion"""" charge is being brought under Article 98(f) of the Penal Code, and which is punishable with imprisonment of between six months and five years.  The Emergency State Security Court for Misdemeanours (Mahkamat Junah Amn al-Dawla Taware') is an exceptional court established within the framework of state of emergency legislation. Defendants do not have the right of appeal before a higher tribunal: they may submit a complaint (tazallum) against the verdict to the Military Governor (al-Hakem al-'Askari) who, irrespective of whether such a complaint has been submitted, must either uphold or quash the verdict, or he may order a retrial before the same court. If the original verdict is upheld, the defendant may submit a petition (iltimas) to the Military Governor on humanitarian grounds. The decision of the Military Governor is final.  Human Rights Watch (HRW) and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC) are gravely concerned that these men are being brought to trial because of their sexual orientation, as well as for the exercise of their rights to free expression and association. Article 98(f) of the Penal Code, in particular, continues to be used to prosecute individuals - including writers and members of minority religious groups - for the expression of ideas deemed to """"offend religion"""", prosecutions which clearly violate their right to freedom of expression.  HRW and IGLHRC are also gravely concerned by reports that the men may have been subjected to torture during detention, and that they are to be tried before an exceptional court whose proceedings fail to meet internationally recognized standards for fair trial as set out in Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), to which Egypt is a state party.  According to the Egyptian daily newspaper al-Ahram Supreme State Security Prosecution officials accused the defendants, on the basis of witness testimony and materials seized from the defendants' homes, of the following: having exploited Islam, including through the false interpretation of Quranic verses, in order to propagate extremist ideas; the performance of immoral acts; the use of perverted sexual practices in rituals; being contemptuous and derisory towards the revealed religions and fomenting sedition or strife.  The accused were arrested in the early hours of May 11, 2001, following a raid by police and State Security Intelligence (SSI) personnel on a party held aboard the Queen Boat, moored on the Nile in Cairo's Zamalek district. Initial reports in the Egyptian media suggested that those arrested were part of a """"Satanic cult"""" and that they were being held under charges of """"exploiting religion to promote extreme ideas to create strife and belittle the revealed religions."""" It subsequently became clear that the arrests were carried out because the men were suspected of engaging in consensual sexual activity with persons of the same sex. The detainees were subjected to forensic examinations, apparently in order to determine whether they had engaged in anal intercourse. The results of these examinations were presented at hearings before the Supreme State Security Prosecution on June 6 and 7.  Within the first twenty-four hours of arrest, while held at al-Azbakiyya police station, some of the men were reportedly beaten and ill-treated, apparently to force them to confess to homosexuals practices. During this time, they were held incommunicado without the possibility of contacting their relatives or lawyers. The following day, May 12, they were brought before the Supreme State Security Prosecution and interrogated. In the absence of defense counsel, none of the defendants stated that they had been tortured. Some of them subsequently made such statements at the next hearing held on May 23, after having had access to counsel. However, prosecution officials did not authorize medical examinations in order to verify their claims, apparently because no physical traces of torture were visible at that time.  Following the May 12 hearing, at which the accused were ordered detained for a two-week period pending investigation, they were transferred to Tora Prison on the outskirts of Cairo, where they remain. Their detention periods were extended for additional two-week periods on May 23, June 7 and June 21, with the exception of one of the accused who was released on health grounds on May 23 although the case against him remained pending. Initially their relatives were hindered in visiting them and their right to defense counsel was restricted. Some of their visitors also reported being harassed and insulted by the prison authorities.  In the days following the arrests, the detainees were subjected to a campaign of vilification in the Egyptian media. The names of the detainees, together with details of the profession and place of work of some of them, were published in several newspapers in articles that were noticeably similar in content and style. The level of detail and similarity of the wording suggested that this information was based on leaks from official sources. Egyptian legislation prohibits the publication of any details concerning an ongoing investigation or trial that would influence the course of such proceedings (Law No. 96 of 1996 Concerning the Regulation of Journalism, Article 23). Similarly, the 26 March 1998 Code of Ethics of the Egyptian Journalists' Association stipulates that its members refrain from publishing details of a criminal or civil investigation or trial with the aim of influencing the course of such proceedings.  The right to freedom of expression and association and the right to freedom from discrimination on the basis of sex, which includes sexual orientation, are fundamental human rights recognized in international treaties, including the ICCPR. Being held solely on these grounds thus violates these detainees' basic human rights. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, HRW and IGLHRC believe the defendants' detention to be so motivated, and urge their immediate and unconditional release.  Egypt is also a state party to the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. Both the Torture Convention and the ICCPR prohibit cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. In line with their obligations under these treaties, it is incumbent on the Egyptian authorities to consider seriously any allegations of torture and ill-treatment made by the defendants, and to undertake a thorough investigation in this regard. Such treatment includes the pain and humiliation of forced physical examinations of the anal and genital regions.","Middle East/North Africa, Egypt","LGBT Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/07/03/indonesia-violence-and-political-impasse-papua","Indonesia- Violence and Political Impasse in Papua","Indonesia: Violence and Political Impasse in Papua","","07/03/2001","Indonesia's crackdown on the Papuan independence movement is diminishing prospects for peace, Human Rights Watch said in a new report issued today. A broad civilian independence movement has emerged alongside a decades-old armed insurgency in Indonesia's easternmost province, and Indonesian security forces increasingly have responded with force, imprisoning civilian leaders and terrorizing villagers. The result, Human Rights Watch said, is more violence. """"In the last six months, we've seen arbitrary arrests and torture in Papua that should have ended with Soeharto's ouster,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"What we haven't seen is the political will to address any of the underlying causes of the conflict. The political infighting in Jakarta may be partly to blame. But those political battles are no excuse for failing to heed what's happening in the outlying provinces."""" The crackdown has also elicited an increasingly violent response from armed Papuan groups, which have stepped up attacks on security posts. In early June 2001, rebels kidnapped two Belgian filmmakers in an apparent bid to attract international attention. The Indonesian attorney general is due to decide by mid-July whether to make one of the most serious cases of police brutality in Papua the first case to be brought before Indonesia's new human rights courts. Jakarta failed to deliver on promises of meaningful autonomy for Papua, Human Rights Watch said. Instead, since June 2000, authorities have sent thousands of new troops to the province. They have banned peaceful expression of support for Papuan independence and have moved aggressively against independence demonstrators, in many cases killing or seriously injuring them. Key Papuan leaders have been arrested, and prominent civil society groups, including human rights organizations, have been subjected to increased surveillance and harassment.  In the 27-page report, """"Violence and Political Impasse in Papua,"""" Human Rights Watch details the emergence of the civilian movement and the government's response, and describes key cases. These include not only cases of Indonesian security force abuses, but several incidents in which Papuan militants attacked non-Papuan migrants from other parts of Indonesia. The report calls on Papuan political and community leaders to join religious leaders in condemning such violence and to take steps to stop it.  The report looks in greatest detail at the so-called Abepura case, in which police killed three students and beat up and tortured dozens of others following a December 2000 rebel attack on a police post in Abepura, near the provincial capital Jayapura. Human rights groups that reported on the incident were summoned by police for questioning and continue to be threatened with police action.  Indonesia's National Human Rights Commission has recommended that the Abepura case be heard by Indonesia's new human rights courts. The courts, called for by legislation passed in 2000, are only now being established, and as yet no judges have been appointed. """"More than two years after Soeharto resigned, the police and military still enjoy near total impunity,"""" Saunders said. """"With the Abepura case, Attorney General Baharuddin Lopa and President Wahid have a chance to signal that the Indonesian government is finally committed to prosecuting serious human rights violations. But they must get the new court in place first.""""  Other steps Indonesia should take, according to Human Rights Watch, include the removal of arbitrary restrictions on access to all regions of Papua by journalists and humanitarian workers; the ending of all forms of racial and ethnic discrimination against Papuans; and prosecution of those responsible for anti-migrant violence. """"We urge other governments to press Jakarta to invite the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture to visit Papua,"""" said Saunders. """"And we hope those attending the ASEAN post ministerial conference in Hanoi in late July will express concern about ongoing abuses in Papua when they meet with senior Indonesian officials."""" Human Rights Watch's new report on Papua will be followed in mid-July by a report updating the situation in Aceh, where popular support for independence has been fueled by failure of the government to prosecute human rights abuses. Note on terminology: Indonesia's easternmost province is still formally known as Irian Jaya, but is now widely called Papua, following the lead of Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid and in deference to the wishes of the province's indigenous inhabitants. West Papua is the name preferred by leaders of the independence movement.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Since 1998, eight Security Council resolutions have called on the Yugoslav government to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).    """"Yugoslavia has an overriding obligation under international law to cooperate with the tribunal,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's international justice program. """"The legal basis provided by international law for the transfer not only of Milosevic but of all indicted Yugoslav citizens is unshakable.""""     On Friday, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic invoked Yugoslavia's obligations under international law to support the transfer. Some in Yugoslavia are questioning the transfer, however, asserting that it may have violated Yugoslav law. """"If Yugoslavia were to invoke domestic legislation as a reason for not fulfilling its obligations under international law it would run against the basic principles of international law,"""" said Dicker.     The tribunal was created in 1993 by U.N. Security Council resolution 827, which obliged all U.N. member states to """"cooperate fully"""" with the tribunal and """"take any measures necessary under their domestic law"""" to comply with its demands. The U.N. Charter's article 25, in turn, obliges member states to implement Security Council decisions.     Since 1998, four Security Council resolutions specifically called on the Yugoslav government to cooperate fully with the tribunal. They are: resolution 1160 (March 31, 1998), para. 17; resolution 1199 (September 23, 1998), para. 13; resolution 1203 (October 24, 1998), para. 14; and resolution 1207, (November 17, 1998), paras. 1-4 . Two additional resolutions called on all parties to the Dayton Accords, which included Yugoslavia, to cooperate. These are resolution 1247 (June 18, 1999), para. 3; and resolution 1305 (June 21, 2000), para. 3.

Human Rights Watch played a pivotal role in gathering evidence of atrocities committed in the Balkans during Milosevic's thirteen-year rule, and in bringing international pressure to indict, arrest and try those most culpable for these horrendous crimes. In fact, Human Rights Watch conducted primary research and provided crucial evidence for six of the seven episodes of mass murder upon which the Milosevic indictment is based. We expect that further charges will be filed against Milosevic for his role in earlier atrocities outside of Kosovo, such as the slaughters in Vukovar and Srebrenica, which Human Rights Watch has also investigated and reported on.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The three organizations said the move must cover all known or suspected government opponents or human rights activists who have been imprisoned, prosecuted or harassed simply for the peaceful exercise of the right to freedom of opinion, expression or association.  The repression of government critics has intensified over the past two weeks with prominent figures being arrested, put on trial or arbitrarily banned from travel.  Most recently, Sihem Ben Sedrine, a journalist and spokesperson of the Conseil national des liberte en Tunisie (CNLT), National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, was arrested on 26 June after flying into Tunis and charged with defaming the judiciary and spreading false information, apparently because of her recent public criticism outside Tunisia of the deteriorating human rights situation. She has been jailed, awaiting trial on 5 July.  On 19 June 2001, Mohamed Mouadda, former prisoner of conscience and former leader of the Mouvement des democrates socialistes (MDS), Movement of Democratic Socialists, the main legal opposition party in Tunisia, was arrested and sent back to jail apparently because of his recent public calls for increased political freedoms. He had been conditionally released in December 1996 after spending over a year in prison on trumped-up charges of being a Libyan agent. He had been arrested on 9 October 1995, the very day he went public with a critical letter addressed to President Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali complaining about the lack of genuine pluralism.  Moncef Marzouki, a doctor and leading member of the CNLT, also faces a period in jail. Since December 2000 he has had a one-year prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted of belonging to an """"unauthorized"""" association (namely the CNLT) and spreading """"false"""" information in connection with statements he made on human rights and the need for government transparency. He is awaiting the outcome of an appellate court hearing which began on 23 June 2001 and continues on 7 July.  Up to 1,000 political prisoners, most of them prisoners of conscience, remain in prison in Tunisia. They are detained in conditions that amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Dozens have gone on hunger strike already this year to demand their release and to protest against torture and their conditions of detention, including lack of access to medical care. Mohamed M'seddi, a former Tunis Air pilot serving a 27-year sentence imposed in 1993 for belonging to a """"subversive movement"""", was on hunger strike in April and May 2001 to appeal for urgent medical treatment for injuries sustained when he was tortured in pre-trial detention.  Hundreds of former prisoners of conscience are routinely prevented from working or resuming a normal life. They are required, often arbitrarily, to report to the police on a regular basis, ranging from several times a day to several times a week. One former prisoner of conscience, Hei Bejaoui, began a hunger strike on 8 May in protest of the restrictive and discriminatory measures imposed on him by the authorities since his release. Denied a medical card and passport since he was released in September 1999, he has to pay for any medical treatment in Tunisia and cannot go abroad for treatment. He had been shot in the leg when police arrested him in 1991 and still has a bullet lodged in his knee.  """"The restrictions on former prisoners of conscience from taking up work, accessing medical care, moving freely inside Tunisia and travelling abroad are unacceptable and must be ended immediately,"""" the three international human rights groups said.  Human rights activists are confronted by routine harassment by security forces, including having their telecommunication lines severed and passports confiscated. Those who manage to obtain their passports may still be prevented from leaving the country. Sadri Khiari, a leading member of the Rassemblement pour une alternative internationale de d?eloppement (RAID) and also a founding member of the CNLT, was told by the authorities on 19 June 2001 at Tunis-Carthage airport, where he had gone to take a flight to Paris, that he was barred from leaving the country because of two outstanding judicial cases against him. He had succeeded in having his passport returned to him on 16 June only after beginning a hunger strike two days earlier with three companions whose passports had also been confiscated by the authorities.  Tunisians who work or study abroad are often arrested when they return home and then imprisoned on charges of having had contacts with political opponents abroad. Lotfi Ferhati, a Tunisian living in France, was arrested in August 2000 when he arrived in Tunisia with his wife for a family visit. He was held in the Ministry of the Interior for 18 days, where he was reportedly tortured and forced to sign an unread statement admitting to links with an unauthorized Islamist group. He retracted the statement during his trial. No other evidence or testimony was presented to the court, yet on 31 January he was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.  """"We call on the government of Tunisia to free all prisoners of conscience from prison or from regimes of harassment,"""" the three organizations said.

Human Rights Watch said the prosecution of a former head of state before an international tribunal would create a groundbreaking precedent in international law.   """"This is a great day for the victims of war in the former Yugoslavia,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of Human Rights Watch's International Justice Program.   Serbian authorities today surrendered Milosevic to representatives of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. The former Yugoslav president had been in a Belgrade prison since his arrest on April 1 on domestic corruption charges.   """"Some people have argued that sending Milosevic to The Hague would derail the democratic transition underway in Belgrade,"""" said Dicker. """"On the contrary, this is a victory for the rule of law in Serbia.""""   The surrender of Milosevic makes clear that no leader accused of crimes against humanity is beyond the reach of international justice, Human Rights Watch said.   Today's transfer appears to enjoy the support of most members of the government in Belgrade and a majority of the public. The latest polls indicate that 48 percent of respondents support cooperation with the tribunal, while only 36 percent oppose it. While mounting international pressure in recent weeks contributed to this change of heart, it also appears to stem from an increasing willingness by the Serbian people to come to terms with the legacy of the Milosevic era, Human Rights Watch said. Recent discoveries of mass graves of Kosovo Albanians, near Belgrade and in other parts of Serbia, contributed to the change.   On May 24, 1999, the tribunal indicted Milosevic, along with four other senior officials and officers, for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Yugoslav and Serbian troops under their command in Kosovo in early 1999. The crimes include the slaughter of hundreds of ethnic Albanians, forcible deportations of hundreds of thousands of people, and persecution based on racial, religious, and political identification.   """"The surrender of Milosevic creates a positive momentum for the arrest and surrender of other indictees,"""" Dicker said. He urged NATO troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina to arrest all indictees still at large in that country, including Radovan Karadzic, the wartime leader of the Bosnian Serbs, and Gen. Ratko Mladic, the wartime military leader.   It is believed that twenty-six indictees currently live in Republika Srpska, which is a part of Bosnia, and eleven more live in Serbia. Yugoslav authorities have recently submitted to a district court in Belgrade a demand for surrender to the tribunal of three former Yugoslav army officers.   Human Rights Watch urged the Yugoslav authorities to surrender the remaining indictees to the war crimes tribunal.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Among the recipients is Daniel Bekoutou whose reports played a key role in the international effort to hold Chadian dictator Hissene Habre accountable for crimes against humanity committed under his rule. The Hellman/Hammett awards also recognize Maria Petreu for her outspoken criticism of extreme right ideology in Romania and Esmat Qaney whose writings have been burned and banned by successive Afghan regimes. Each year, Human Rights Watch presents Hellman/Hammett grants to writers around the world who have been targets of political persecution. The grant program began in 1989 when the estates of American authors Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett asked Human Rights Watch to design a program for writers in financial need as a result of expressing their views. This year's grants totaled $175,000. In many countries, governments use military and presidential decrees, criminal libel, and sedition laws to silence critics. Writers and journalists are threatened, harassed, assaulted, or jailed merely for providing information from nongovernmental sources. In addition to those who are directly targeted, many others are forced to practice self-censorship. Short biographies of the recipients who received grants in 2001 follow. Aung Pwint (Burma), a poet whose work expresses the feelings of ordinary people about the social and economic crisis in their country, was arrested in 1967 and again in 1978 because of his contacts with the student movement. During the 1988 pro-democracy movement, he acted as joint secretary of the People's Peaceful Demonstration Committee in the Delta region. Subsequently, he joined a fledgling media group, which produced videos and calendars. In 1996, the military government banned his videos because they were considered to show too negative a picture of Burmese society and living standards. In 1999, he was arrested and sentenced to eight years in prison. Mikel Azurmendi (Spain), who writes poetry, children's tales, political commentary, and social anthropological essays on Basque history, is a professor of social anthropology at the University of Bilbao. His major contribution has been to deconstruct the theory of """"ethnic exclusionism"""" that radical nationalists use to define the Basque historical experience. In the 1960s, Mr. Azurmendi was a member of the armed separatist group ETA. After its violent attacks on the Franco regime, he left to join the Basque pro-democracy movement. He is a founder of the Foro Ermua, one of the most prestigious groups promoting peace and democracy in the Basque region. Meanwhile, ETA has systematically subjected him to verbal abuse, painting """"Azurmendi to the firing wall"""" on his office, and distributing pamphlets urging that he be killed. After a bomb attack in August 2000, he fled to the United States. Bei Ling (China), poet and essayist, came to the United States in 1988 on an exchange with a Chinese-language newspaper. After the Tiananmen Square protest, he stayed and founded Tendency Quarterly, a scholarly literary magazine. Since 1998, he has spent most of his time in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan researching, writing and editing. In 2000, he rented an apartment and opened editorial offices in Beijing. After printing the summer issue of Tendency, he was detained and charged with """"illegal publication."""" Beijing security forces interrogated him and threatened a ten-year prison term. They offered leniency if he provided information about the identity of Chinese citizens who had helped to produce Tendency. He refused. After an international protest, he was fined $24,000 and released. Daniel Bekoutou (Chad) is an investigative journalist, whose problems started when he uncovered financial scandals in health and environmental programs in Senegal, where he lived in exile. In November 1999, he was attacked and badly beaten by operatives who accused him of writing overly critical articles on Chad's President Idress Deby. Mr. Bekoutou then began covering the case of Hissene Habre, Chad's exiled former dictator who was indicted in Senegal on torture charges. Bekoutou wrote numerous articles exposing political killings, torture, and disappearances during the Habre regime. He played a key role in keeping newspapers from prematurely leaking news of the indictment, which would have given Habr?time to flee. The day after Habre's indictment, Bekoutou began receiving death threats. Fearing for his life, he fled to Paris. Bui Ngoc Tan (Vietnam) started a career in journalism in 1954 writing in accord with the Vietnamese Communist Party (VCP) line. Gradually, he became critical of the VCP perspective. In 1968, he was arrested as a """"revisionist and antiparty element"""" and imprisoned without trial from 1968 to 1973. After his release, he wrote stories and novels but was banned from publishing and had to earn his living as a laborer. In 1995, he was permitted to publish again. Nhung Nguoi Rach Viec (These People with Nothing to Do), published in 1995, and Mot Ngay Dai Dang Dang (A Very Long and Boring Day), published in 1999, are mildly critical of the ruling regime. In 2000, he published Chuyen Ke Nam 2000 (Story Told in Year 2000), a denunciation of the communist detention policy. This book was too much for the censors; it was recalled and burned. He has undergone numerous interrogations and is now under surveillance. Chan Mony (Cambodia), journalist, has written mostly on social issues and public safety - law enforcement, robberies, mob violence, and street demonstrations. He currently works for the Evening News, a paper generally regarded as leaning toward the ruling Cambodian People's Party. In March 1997, while covering a peaceful demonstration in front of the National Assembly, someone threw grenades into the crowd killing at least sixteen people and injuring hundreds of others. Mony's right leg was broken, and shrapnel pierced his left eye. Members of a bodyguard unit of Prime Minister Hun Sen were implicated in the attack, but no one has ever been arrested. Mony's eye injury flared up again, putting him in constant pain. Mridula Garg (India) is a prolific writer in many genres, including fiction, plays, essays, and journalism. In 1979, she was charged under the penal code with writing pornographic literature, and a warrant was issued for her arrest based on two pages from one novel. The literary magazine, Sarika, conducted a campaign against her, branding her a woman who wrote """"shock value fiction"""" and causing her subsequent books to be denied their due literary assessment. Carmen Gurruchaga (Spain) is a journalist who has covered nationalism, Basque politics, and terrorism-related issues in print and on radio and television since 1989. In December 1997, a bomb was found on the front door of the apartment where she lived with her two sons. She had written a front-page story about a fugitive Basque youth who was acquitted by a jury in a controversial trial even though he had admitted killing two policemen. This forced her to move from her lifelong home in San Sebastian to Madrid. Her name is often found on """"black lists,"""" and Molotov cocktails have been thrown at her office. Kong Bun Chhoeun (Cambodia), novelist and songwriter, has been writing prolifically since the 1950s but stopped and became a farmer while the Khmer Rouge were in power. If he had revealed his identity during their regime, it is likely he would have been killed. Cambodia is now moving toward democracy, but powerful people continue to ignore the law. The plot of his last book, The Destiny of Marina, or Acid-Laced Vengeance, published in 2000, bore many similarities to the 1999 scandal of a karaoke singer who was attacked with acid by the jealous wife of a government official. The book details the problem of official impunity in Cambodia. After publication, Kong Bun Chhoeun received death threats from the husband of the woman who had mutilated the singer. In November 2000, he fled to Thailand. Moncef Marzouki (Tunisia) is a medical doctor and leading human rights activist whose writing is banned in Tunisia. Some of his work has been published in Arabic in Egypt; some has been published in Europe in French. In 1994, after Dr. Marzouki entered the presidential election against the incumbent, he was jailed for four months, and the government closed the community medical clinic that he founded. Threats to Dr. Marzouki and his family caused his wife and daughters to move to Europe. In June 1999, he was abducted by security officials and held incommunicado for several days. He has been denied a passport, making him unable to travel abroad for professional reasons or to visit his family. He has faced repeated judicial investigations on spurious charges. In December 2000, he was sentenced to one year in prison for """"defaming the authorities"""" and """"spreading false information."""" Gemechu Melka Tufa, pen name Motii Biya, (Ethiopia), journalist and author of several books on Oromo society and history, was arrested in 1997. His arrest is believed to be connected to newspaper columns he wrote and his membership in the Ethiopian Human Rights League. He was held without charge or trial for more than two years, and then suddenly released on bail. At first he returned to Addis Ababa, but soon realized that his safety could not be guaranteed if he remained in Ethiopia. He was granted refugee status and received political asylum in Canada. Dunya Mikhail (Iraq) is a widely published poet and journalist, whose allegorical book, Diary of a Wave Outside the Sea, was banned in Iraq. She wrote anti-war poems that could not be published in Iraq because they were deemed """"subversive."""" Warned that her """"life is at risk"""" if she doesn't """"stop anti-government writings"""" she sought asylum and fled to the United States. Octovanius Mote (Indonesia), bureau chief in the capital of Irian Jaya (West Papua) for Indonesia's biggest and best-known newspaper, Kompas, served as rapporteur for a """"national dialogue"""" on Irian Jaya between President Habibie and 100 community leaders. Habibie's participation was conditioned on acceptance of a ban on discussion of independence. While in Jarkarta for the dialogue, the leaders presented Habibie with a petition demanding independence. A few months later, Mr. Mote and four intellectuals who had been involved in the dialogue, were blacklisted on fabricated charges that they had been buying arms. The blacklisting was intended to keep them from leaving the country, but it was announced the same day that Mr. Mote was scheduled to go to the United States as part of a U.S. Information Agency Visitors Program, and he made it out. The Open Society Institute gave Mr. Mote a grant to stay at Cornell University for a year. Just as he was getting ready to go back, the crackdown on the independence movement took a sharp turn for the worse and caused him to postpone his return. Hasan Mujtaba (Pakistan), journalist, has written extensively on political corruption, the role of senior politicians and their aides in the drug trade, trafficking Bangladeshi women into Pakistan with the help of Pakistani border forces, recruitment of teenage students from Islamic seminaries to fight with the Taliban in Afghanistan, urban decay, and male homosexuality. He is also a published poet in his native language, Sindhi. Mr. Mujtaba's life has been threatened repeatedly, most recently prompted by his research into treatment of Pakistan's Hindu minority. In April 1999, he came to the U.S. to receive an award from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and stayed to seek asylum. Grigory Pasko (Russia), journalist and naval officer, was arrested in 1997 and charged with state treason (article 275 of the criminal code) in retaliation for his writing about the dumping of radioactive waste in the Sea of Japan. Russian authorities claimed that he intended to pass state secrets to a foreign power. After spending twenty months in prison, he was acquitted of the treason charges and found guilty of a lesser charge, military misconduct. The Military Board of the Russian Supreme Court accepted the prosecution's appeal of the acquittal in November 2000, and the treason trial against him reopened in March 2001. If convicted, Pasko faces a prison sentence of twelve-to-twenty years. Pasko protested the three-year prison term for the military misconduct charge, which he was not required to serve. Maria Petreu (Romania), poet, philosopher, and university professor in Cluj, founded and edits the magazine Apostrof, a rare voice of reason and integrity in Romania today. She has written critically about Romanian extreme right ideology, provoking repressive reactions from many antidemocratic political groups, gradually isolating herself and Apostrof. She regularly receives threats and was attacked by a mob at a public reading. Pham Que Duong (Vietnam) started his career in the People's Liberation Army in 1945 at age fourteen. Over the next forty years, he rose to the rank of colonel. In 1982, he became editor in chief of Tap Chi Lich Su Quan Su (Military History Review) and devoted all of his time to writing. In 1986, he was fired because he refused to obey orders not to mention exploits of dismissed officers. In 1990, he was investigated and accused of supporting Tran Xuan Bach, Secretary General of the Vietnamese Communist Party for the seventh Congress, who was expelled for advocating pluralism. In 1990, Pham Que Duong quit the VCP in solidarity with a prominent outspoken dissident and became a democracy activist. His house has been searched several times, his telephone tapped, his e-mail suppressed, and he is often summoned to police headquarters for questioning. Esmat Qaney (Afghanistan), novelist and short story writer, fled from Afghanistan's Zabol province in 1980 and subsequently settled in the Pakistani city of Quetta. Following the mujahideen takeover of Kabul in 1992, the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani judged Qaney's novel The Fifth Marriage hostile to Islamic teachings and burned copies of it. In the summer of 2000, after publication of a collection of his stories, Zeera Ra Wastawai Khair Yusai (Send Charity, God Bless You), Taliban authorities now ruling Afghanistan found the book was an """"insult to religious leaders"""" and issued a decree branding Qaney and his publisher, Mustafa Sahar, """"apostates."""" Taliban supporters in Quetta seized all copies of the book and burned them outside a mosque. Fearing for his safety, Qaney left his family and went into hiding. San San Nweh (Burma), novelist and poet, has spent long periods in prison for her political activities. She has been serving her current ten-year sentence since October 1994 for """"fomenting trouble"""" by producing anti-government reports and sending them to foreign journalists. She has been offered freedom if she will renounce all political activity, but she has regularly refused despite being forced to sit cross-legged in a cramped cell with three other political convicts and barred from speaking for more than fifteen minutes a day. She is plagued with poor health - kidney infections, high blood pressure, and eye problems. Wang Yiliang (China), poet and essayist, has been involved in underground literary activity since the early 1980s. State Security authorities have kept him under close surveillance, have regularly summoned him for interrogation and detention, and banned publication of his work. In January 2000, Wang Yiliang was arrested for """"disrupting social order"""" and sentenced to two years of """"reeducation through labor."""" Sanar Yurdatapan (Turkey), songwriter and composer, has also written fiction and was a regular columnist for the Kurdish daily newspaper, Ozgur Gundem. Following the military coup in 1980, he lived in exile in Germany for eleven years. On his return in 1991, he threw himself into human rights work. He has developed an original method for attacking repression of free expression. When someone is convicted for expressing a non-violent opinion, he finds a prominent person to republish the statement and accompanies the republication with a disclaimer defending the person's right to express his views, not the views themselves. The republications are cheap photocopies, but this is enough to trigger prosecution under Turkish law. When prosecutors are reluctant to lodge charges against prominent people, Mr. Yurdatapan forces them to prosecute by threatening prosecution for not carrying out their duties. He has published forty-three Freedom for Freedom of Expression booklets. The first one caused ninety defendants to be charged. The last one had 70,000 publishers who are all now subject to state prosecution. The prosecutors usually find ways to avoid concluding the cases, but in attempts to stop Mr. Yurdatapan, they have lodged trumped up charges against him and imprisoned him three times. Other recipients will remain anonymous because of the dangerous circumstances in which they are living. The Hellman/Hammett grants are announced each spring. In the eleven previous years of the program, more than 400 writers received grants totaling nearly two million dollars. The Hellman/Hammett program also makes small emergency grants from time to time throughout the year to writers who have an urgent need to leave their country or who find themselves in desperate financial circumstances as a result of political persecution.","Africa, Chad, Europe/Central Asia, Romania, Global",""

In February 2000, Hissene Habre known as the """"African Pinochet,"""" was indicted in Senegal on charges of torture and crimes against humanity. It was the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. But after repeated interference by President Wade, which drew protests from United Nations monitors on the independence of the judiciary and on torture, Senegal's highest court ruled in March 2001 that Habre could not be tried in Senegal for crimes committed in Chad. Habre's victims argued that this decision violated the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture which required Senegal to prosecute alleged torturers, and announced that they would seek Habre's extradition to Belgium, where a criminal investigation against Habre is also underway. On April 7, however, President Wade announced that he had asked Habre to leave Senegal. The victims, fearing that Habre would move out of the reach an extradition request, appealed to the United Nations Committee Against Torture, which called on Senegal """"not to expel Mr. Hissene Habreand to take all necessary measures to prevent Mr. Hissene Habre from leaving Senegalese territory except pursuant to an extradition demand."""" Just before coming to the United States, however, President Wade told journalists that he was still seeking the dictator's departure and claimed that the United Nations had not asked Senegal to hold Habre. """"Hissene Habre is an African Pinochet who should face justice for his crimes,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, who represents the victims before the United Nations. """"President Wade should support this landmark effort to enforce the rule of law instead of shielding one of Africa's worst criminals."""" Senegalese organizations protested President Wade's continuing efforts to shield Habre. """"My country has always been a leader in human rights,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"But the shenanigans surrounding this case are really hurting our reputation and betraying Habre's victims who placed their faith in Senegal and took its ratification of the Torture Convention seriously."""" Habre, now 58, took power in Chad in 1982. Habre's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1984), Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habre was deposed in December 1990 and has lived in Senegal since. A truth commission accused Habr?s government of 40,000 murders and systematic torture. Brody also announced that Human Rights Watch had written to other governments, advising them that Habre's victims will seek to bring him to justice wherever he goes. The United Nations Committee against Torture is composed of 10 experts elected by the 123 states which have ratified the Torture Convention. States usually comply with its decisions. President Wade, whose election in March 2000 ended decades of one-party rule in Senegal, is in the United States to attend the U.N. Special Session on AIDS.

Annan for a second term as the United Nations Secretary-General. Earlier today, the Council unanimously chose the Ghanaian to serve for another five years as the world organization's seventh head. """"Of all the secretaries-general to date, Annan has best understood the centrality of human rights to the work of the United Nations,"""" said Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's United Nations representative. """"His reappointment is a real victory for human rights.""""  From the moment he took his job in January 1997, Annan has spoken frequently, forcefully and truthfully about human rights. In his first press conference as Secretary-General in what was at the time a revolutionary statement, he stressed the importance and role of human rights in four main areas of U.N. activity: peace and security, humanitarian affairs, economic and social affairs, and development. Since then, he has taken numerous practical steps to integrate human rights into these areas of work.  The Secretary General has been particularly forceful in linking human rights with security issues and has repeatedly emphasized the imperative to address human rights issues when addressing conflict situations.  He has been unequivocal in his support of international justice. For example, he backed the creation of the International Criminal Court despite opposition from some of the U.N.'s most powerful members. He also instructed his negotiator to write a disclaimer renouncing an amnesty for a Sierra Leonean rebel group with an atrocious human rights record, at the conclusion of a Sierra Leone peace accord in 1999.  In what has come to be known as the """"Annan Doctrine,"""" he has repeatedly stated that state sovereignty must not shield states in the face of crimes against humanity. During the wave of post-referendum violence in East Timor in the fall of 1999, he warned that senior Indonesian officials risked prosecution for crimes against humanity if they did not consent to the deployment of an available multinational force. They quickly relented.  He also undertook several important initiatives meant to revise the internal workings of the United Nations on matters of significance for human rights. Among other things, he commissioned an independent report to investigate the role of the world organization in failing to prevent the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, and in 2000 he asked for a thorough review of the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations.  He has not shied away from confronting leaders of major powers about their human rights practices. For example, last month in Moscow, he urged Russia's president Putin to allow U.N. investigators to conduct missions to the region of Chechnya, something the Russians have resisted for more than a year.  Some of Annan's human rights efforts have yet to bear fruit. Several of his panel's recommendations on peacekeeping, in particular those regarding a substantial enhancement of the planning and preparation capacity of the Office of the High Commissioner and its ability to second personnel to mission task forces in New York, have yet to be implemented. His """"Global Compact"""" for integrating human rights and other social values into the operations of multinational corporations has yet to move from a talk shop to a forum for developing enforceable standards.  Despite much effort, he has yet to secure funding for a Sierra Leone tribunal, personnel for a human rights component of the U.N. mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and increase the share of the U.N.'s regular budget that goes to human rights. These are among the challenges facing Mr. Annan in a second term.  """"We hope Annan's second term will allow him to consolidate some of the work that has only begun, such as the implementation of the recommendations regarding peacekeeping, or making his human rights global compact with the business community more meaningful,"""" Weschler said. """"In order to make his human rights legacy lasting, he also needs to work on significantly increasing the still woefully inadequate resources for the Office of the High Commissioner."""" The General Assembly is expected confirm this decision on Friday.","Global","United Nations"

More than 35 million people are living with HIV. 22 million men, women and children have died, and 15,000 people are infected every day.  The AIDS epidemic is the most devastating crisis in the history of human health. More than 35 million people are living with HIV. 22 million men, women and children have died, and 15,000 people are infected every day. If current trends do not change, there will be more than 40 million AIDS orphans in Africa alone by 2010. At current infection rates, a fifteen-year-old boy in Botswana now has an 85 percent chance of dying of AIDS. But the pandemic represents more than a health catastrophe. It is both a product of, and exacerbated by, pervasive violations of human rights. HIV/AIDS is a preventable and manageable disease that has been turned into a pandemic by ignorance, neglect and violations of human rights. The disease most deeply affects those least able to enjoy their rights: the poorest, the weakest, the least educated, the most stigmatized.  DISCRIMINATION Pervasive discrimination prevents women from protecting themselves from sexual assault or unprotected sex, stigmatizes women who are HIV-positive, thus discouraging them from being tested for the HIV virus, and denies women treatment that is available for the disease or infections associated with it. The second-class status of women in economic, social and civic life has fueled the pandemic in much of the world. Fundamental inequalities between men and women must be addressed as part of the response to the AIDS pandemic. Discrimination also extends to men who are infected so that they, too, are discouraged from testing and seeking treatment. Discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS not only discourages them from seeking testing and treatment, but affects all areas of their lives. INADEQUATE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT EFFORTS All governments, including those in the developed world, have an obligation to fulfill the right to health to the maximum of their available resources. Governments have been far too slow in fulfilling their obligations to protect the human right to health by planning, funding, and implementing programs to provide comprehensive prevention, treatment and care. Without these programs, millions of people will die. Highly effective treatment and prevention regimes exist to contain HIV/AIDS, but while most people living in rich countries have access to these treatments, the vast majority of those living in poor countries do not.  Donor nations have not fulfilled their obligations to protect the right to health through cooperative, supportive activities, including providing the funds needed for prevention and treatment to save millions of lives. Making prevention and treatment regimes available to all human beings is not a matter of charity. International assistance and cooperation are imperatives of human rights as set out in international human rights law. FAILURE TO FULFILL THE RIGHT TO INFORMATION Many governments in countries where the population is most at risk have not provided enough appropriate information about HIV/AIDS, nor provided the necessary educational programs to prevent its spread. Violations of the human right to receive information needed to protect one's health, as set forth in international human rights covenants, are pervasive. Consistent and accurate information about reproductive health and prevention of HIV is crucial to stem the spread of the pandemic.  ENFORCEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENTS IN VIOLATION OF THE RIGHT TO HEALTH  Governments and international institutions have failed to interpret and enforce international trade agreements regarding pharmaceutical patents in a manner that recognizes their provisions for addressing health emergencies, and is in harmony with and reinforces the right to health as guaranteed in international human rights law. It is clear that this health emergency is sufficient in many countries to permit compulsory licensing and allow parallel imports. A CALL FOR ACTION We, the undersigned human rights organizations, therefore call on all those facing the pandemic to acknowledge that we are confronting a human rights catastrophe that cannot be solved without a global commitment to human rights:  Governments must end entrenched discrimination against women and girls and remove disparities in law, custom, education, and health practice that render them especially vulnerable to HIV/AIDS. Other vulnerable groups that require protection from discrimination include children, men who have sex with men, sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, persons confined in institutions and prison populations, refugees and internally displaced persons. Governments must bring an end to discrimination, through both law and custom, against those infected with HIV/AIDS. And governments should protect the right of all persons not to be excluded, abused or stigmatized for their health status. Governments must protect the right of all persons to means of protection against infection. This includes protecting the right and promoting the capacity of all persons to refuse unwanted or unprotected sexual contact. Governments should ensure that information about people's health, sex, HIV/AIDS is provided with complete candor and freely available. Governments of affected countries must commit the maximum available resources to prevention and treatment strategies, including the necessary public health infrastructure, to protect the human rights at stake. Governments should protect the right of all persons to have access to adequate treatment at affordable prices. Under trade agreements, governments and international institutions should permit compulsory licensing and parallel import of needed pharmaceuticals. These bodies should interpret pharmaceutical patent and property laws consistent with the imperative of the right to health-and the right to life. Donor countries should commit themselves to contributions commensurate with their economic resources. According to the UN Secretary General, an adequate response to the global pandemic demands a minimum of $7-10 billion a year. Other reliable estimates are still higher. Annual funding must remain at this level or higher for decades. The United States contribution to the UN Trust Fund, in light of its percentage of the gross domestic product of the developed world, should be at least $2.5 billion a year. Donor nations and international lending organizations should reduce or write off the debt of poor nations insofar as it is devoted to social sector investment, allowing developing nations to devote more resources to their public health needs. We commit our organizations to use our capabilities of research, advocacy and campaigning, to attack the human rights challenges of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Standing together we can turn a threat which menaces us all into a manageable and preventable disease.  Defending these rights and fighting discrimination in the context of the AIDS pandemic will require an unprecedented mobilization of civic courage, political will and economic resources. But standing up for human rights in this case is as urgent as standing up against torture, political repression and crimes against humanity. If we do not do so, entire generations will die and we will be remembered as those who stood by.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Global","Health, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/06/25/tunisia-revives-hard-line-dissent","Tunisia Revives Hard Line on Dissent","Tunisia Revives Hard Line on Dissent","","06/25/2001","Tunisia  enjoyed a brief political thaw, during which human rights gatherings  took place without police interference and the new  human rights minister  pledged greater  tolerance. This past spring, Tunisia enjoyed a brief political thaw, during which human rights gatherings took place without police interference and the new human rights minister pledged greater tolerance. But last week's detention of opposition leader Mohamed Mouada, the resumption of a trial for human rights activist Moncef Marzouki, and the imposition of a travel ban against activist Sadri Khiari, have effectively ended that thaw.  """"The pressure on those who speak out may ease from time to time,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"But the events of the past week show that the basic intolerance of dissent in Tunisia has not changed.""""  The Tunisian police did not interfere during spring meetings organized by the Tunisian Human Rights League and the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT). From November 2000 through March 2001, security forces had aggressively blocked many such meetings, turning away guests arriving at meeting sites and even closing off public streets to impede access.  In an interview with the French daily Le Monde of April 5, the new human rights minister Slaheddine Ma?ui said, """"We absolutely oppose all forms of harassment of human rights activists."""" But Ma?ui has been largely silent since then, and has done little to dispel the impression that his remarks to Le Monde were intended for foreign consumption at a time of harsh scrutiny of Tunisia's rights practices.  Human Rights Watch called on the government of Tunisia to:  ? Immediately and unconditionally release from prison Mohamed Mouada, who has once again been imprisoned solely because of his criticism of government policies;  ? Restore the right to travel of Sadri Khiari, Moncef Marzouki, and all other Tunisians who have been deprived of passports or prevented from traveling in reprisal for their human rights activities or their real or imputed political views;  ? Cease all measures of harassment against Moncef Marzouki, who has been unjustly convicted and sentenced merely for exercising his right to freedom of expression; and restore him to the professional post from which he was arbitrarily dismissed; and  ? Ensure that all human rights organizations in Tunisia, including the Tunisian Human Rights League and the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia, are free to carry out their mission of monitoring and reporting on human rights conditions.  Background:  On June 19, opposition figure Mohamed Mouada was arrested at his home in Tunis after issuing joint statements with exiled Islamist leader Rachid Ghannouchi and making remarks to foreign-based media critical of the state of public liberties in Tunisia. Mouada, a former president of the Mouvement des D?ocrates Socialistes, a legal opposition party, publicly opposed a possible fourth term for President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, which would require a constitutional amendment before the 2004 elections.  According to a statement from the Ministry of Interior issued on the day of the arrest, Mouada had violated the terms of his conditional release from prison in December 1996. Earlier that year he had been given an eleven-year sentence on trumped-up charges of serving a foreign power, namely Libya. He is now obliged to serve out that sentence.  The same day, Sadri Khiari was prevented from leaving the country on the pretext that he was facing two court cases. Police at Tunis-Carthage airport searched his baggage and confiscated a computer diskette. They furnished no details of the charges against him. Khiari, a painter, is a founding member of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), a human rights organization that the government has refused to recognize. Khiari and three other Tunisians had received their passports a few days earlier after going on hunger strike to protest their arbitrary denial.  On June 23, the Tunis Court of Appeals began hearing an appeal against the """"leniency"""" of the one-year prison sentence imposed on Moncef Marzouki. A verdict is expected July 7. One of Tunisia's best-known human rights activists, Marzouki was convicted December 30 of involvement in an """"unauthorized"""" association -namely the CNLT - and spreading """"false"""" information capable of disturbing """"the public order,"""" in connection with statements he made on human rights and the need for government transparency. When Marzouki refused to appeal his conviction and sentence, citing the political nature of the trial, the prosecution appealed the sentence. Marzouki remained at liberty but unable to leave the country. Until now, no date had been set for the appeal. In July 2000, in apparent reprisal for his human rights work, Marzouki was dismissed from his post as a professor of medicine at a public university.  On June 21, the Tunis Court of Appeals affirmed the lower-court decision nullifying the results of the last internal elections of the Tunisian Human Rights League. That vote, held in October, gave the League a dynamic new steering committee that promptly set about criticizing human rights abuses in an assertive manner. When four unsuccessful candidates in those elections filed a suit contending that the vote had been tainted by irregularities, a court issued an emergency injunction evicting the League's new steering committee from League headquarters and freezing its activities.  On February 12, the first court to hear the case ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the ouster of the new steering committee and a new election to be organized by the League's previous steering committee.  The seemingly paradoxical ruling by the Appeals court this week upheld the voiding of the election of the steering committee while apparently tasking the same, supposedly illegitimate, committee with organizing new elections within a year. It also terminated the administration of the League's offices by a court-appointed administrator, which would in theory enable the steering committee to use the headquarters again.  Some observers saw the Appeals decision as a face-saving compromise. However, it keeps open the possibility of future legal actions against the steering committee should it continue to act in the name of the League, as its leadership has vowed to do.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia","Free Speech"

If Belgrade fails to take these steps, the E.U. and other donors should halt any aid pledged at the donor conference, Dicker said.     Yugoslav officials have been concerned that if they do not cooperate with the Hague tribunal, the donors' conference would not generate sufficient economic assistance for the financially strapped country. But the European Union has consistently failed to link the donors' conference with the arrest and surrender of indictees, Human Rights Watch said.     Under heightened pressure as the donor conference nears, the Yugoslav cabinet adopted a decree on Saturday enabling the country to send the former president Slobodan Milosevic and other indictees in Yugoslavia to The Hague. The decree on cooperation does not, however, acknowledge Yugoslavia's overarching obligation to cooperate with the tribunal. The decree also gives Yugoslav courts the authority to decide whether the tribunal is abiding by its own rules, and it fails to clarify whether a Yugoslav court or the tribunal itself would have the final say when the tribunal asks the national court to let it take over a case.     At the same time, however, Yugoslav deputy prime minister Miroljub Labus stated on Saturday that all indicted Yugoslav citizens have to be transferred to the tribunal, and Serbian prime minister Zoran Djindjic said that Milosevic should be in The Hague within fifteen to twenty days.     """"These commitments are welcome, but there's still little concrete evidence of cooperation,"""" said Dicker.

HIV/AIDS has orphaned about a million children in Kenya and at least 13 million in Africa, and left millions more impoverished and marginalized in many African countries. The disease has also weakened the extended family and other communities to which orphans have traditionally turned.   The report, """"In the Shadow of Death: HIV/AIDS and Children's Rights in Kenya,"""" charges that the Kenyan government has failed to take responsibility for children who are at higher risk of human rights abuse when the disease ravages their families. As children are forced to become breadwinners, they are pulled out of school and often forced to take on potentially dangerous labor that is inappropriate for children.   """"The rights of children have been the missing piece of the AIDS crisis,"""" said Joanne Csete, researcher in the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch and the author of the report. """"If their parents had died in any other way, these children would have been at the top of the agenda. But because the parents died of AIDS, with all of the stigma that implies, they're at the bottom.""""   Leading Kenyan government officials have not spoken out forcefully enough to reduce the social stigma associated with HIV/AIDS, Human Rights Watch said. It called on President Daniel arap Moi to break the """"conspiracy of silence"""" that has fostered discrimination against children affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis.   Many children are also unable to inherit property to which they are entitled because they are unable to navigate legal processes that are cumbersome and ill-suited to claimants who are minors.   The report focuses on Kenya as an illustrative case of a phenomenon that affects much of Africa. Csete said the government of Kenya had moved aggressively in recent weeks to address HIV/AIDS through better access to drugs and condoms. But she said the government had done little to protect the human rights of children orphaned by the epidemic.   """"If families are not there to help these children, then the state has the responsibility to provide protection,"""" said Csete.   Children interviewed by Human Rights Watch said that because of HIV/AIDS, they had to withdraw from school so they could earn money for the family or care for a sick relative, and in some cases to find livelihoods on the street or in domestic labor. Several girls described prostitution as their only way to make a living. Almost all of the orphaned children had faced obstacles to inheriting the house or land to which they were entitled. And many of them did not have good enough information on HIV/AIDS to understand why their parents had suffered and died, and to combat the stigma they faced.   Human Rights Watch called on the Kenyan government to do more to help children to stay in school, and urged the government to make the legal system more accessible to children claiming their property.   Human Rights Watch also urged the Kenyan government to ratify the International Labor Organization convention on hazardous labor for children.","Africa, Kenya","Children's Rights, Health, Women's Rights, Children Separated from Families, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/06/22/israel-sharon-investigation-urged","Israel- Sharon Investigation Urged","Israel: Sharon Investigation Urged","","06/22/2001","A criminal investigation into Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon´s role in the massacre of civilians in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla should be launched, Human Rights Watch urged. The call by Human Rights Watch came as Prime Minister Sharon begins a visit to the United States. The Israeli leader´s visit here comes as controversy mounts in Europe over his responsibility for the 1982 killings. “There is abundant evidence that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed on a wide scale in the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, but to date, not a single individual has been brought to justice,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “President Bush should urge Prime Minister Sharon to cooperate with any investigation.” As Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon had overall responsibility over the Israeli Defense Forces and allowed Phalangist militias to enter the camps where they terrorized the residents for three days. Human Rights Watch said that the United States had a substantial interest in the case because the Israeli occupation of West Beirut followed written U.S. assurances that Palestinians remaining there would be safe, as part of an arrangement that saw the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization forces. The debate in Europe erupted following a BBC documentary on the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, which was aired in the United Kingdom on June 17. The day after, survivors of the massacre lodged a complaint against Sharon in a Belgian court. During the BBC program, Morris Draper, the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East at the time, said that U.S. officials were horrified when told Sharon had allowed Phalange militias into West Beirut and the camps “because it would be a massacre.” He told the BBC that after the killings began he cabled Defense Minister Sharon, telling him, “You must stop the slaughter…. The situation is absolutely appalling. They are killing children. You have the field completely under your control and are therefore responsible for that area.” The Kahan Commission (named after the President of the Israeli Supreme Court) that investigated the massacre in 1983 concluded that “Minister of Defense [Sharon] bears personal responsibility” and should “draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office.” The commission recommended that Prime Minister Menachem Begin remove Sharon from office if he did not resign. Sharon did resign as minister of defense, though he subsequently assumed other cabinet positions. Annexes of the commission report have not yet been made public, and it is not known if they contain additional information specific to Sharon´s involvement. Human Rights Watch said that the findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, could not substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that would bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. Human Rights Watch recognizes that Sharon, in his capacity as Prime Minister, may invoke temporary immunity; however, that should not preclude an active criminal investigation into his conduct whether in Israel, or elsewhere. “Criminal investigations and prosecutions must include militia leaders like Elie Hobeika in Lebanon who carried out these atrocities,” Megally said. “But the Israeli government also has a responsibility to conduct an investigation into the actions of its own high officials who knew – and, in any case, certainly should have known -- that atrocities were likely to occur and did not act promptly to stop them once they knew the killing had started.” Background Details of the massacre: The massacre at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps occurred between September 16 and 18, 1982, after Israel Defense Forces (“IDF”) then occupying Beirut and under Ariel Sharon´s overall command as Israeli Defense Minister permitted members of the Phalange militia into the camps. The precise civilian death toll most likely will never be known. Israeli military intelligence estimated that between 700 and 800 people were killed in Sabra and Shatilla during the sixty-two-hour rampage, while Palestinian and other sources have claimed that the dead numbered up to several thousand. The victims included infants, children, women (including pregnant women), and the elderly, some of whom were mutilated or disemboweled before or after they were killed. Journalists who arrived on the scene immediately after the massacre also saw evidence of the summary execution of young men. To cite only one contemporaneous account, that of Thomas Friedman of the New York Times: “[M]ostly I saw groups of young men in their twenties and thirties who had been lined up against walls, tied by their hands and feet, and then mowed down gangland-style with fusillades of machine-gun fire.” By all accounts, the perpetrators of this indiscriminate slaughter were members of the Phalange (or Kata´eb, in Arabic) militia, a Lebanese force that was armed by and closely allied to Israel since the outbreak of Lebanon´s civil war in 1975. It must be noted, however, that the killings were carried out in an area under IDF control. An IDF forward command post was situated on the roof of a multi-story building located some 200 meters southwest of the Shatilla camp. Findings of the Kahan Commission: In February 1983, the three-member Israeli official independent commission of inquiry charged with investigating the events known as the Kahan Commission named former Defense Minister Sharon as one of the individuals who """"bears personal responsibility"""" for the Sabra and Shatilla massacre. Former Defense Minister Sharon´s decision to allow the Phalange into the camps: The Kahan Commission report detailed the direct role of former Defense Minister Sharon in allowing the Phalangists into the Sabra and Shatilla camps. For instance, then-Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Rafael Eitan testified that the entry of the Phalangists into the refugee camps was agreed upon between former Defense Minister Sharon and himself. Thereafter, former Defense Minister Sharon went to Phalangist headquarters and met with, among others, a number of Phalangist commanders. A document issued by former Defense Minister Sharon´s office containing “The Defense Minister´s Summary of 15 September 1982” states: “For the operation in the camps the Phalangists should be sent in.” That document also stated that “the I.D.F. shall command the forces in the area.” Former Defense Minister Sharon´s disregard of the consequences of that decision: As to former Defense Minister Sharon´s testimony that “no one had imagined the Phalangists would carry out a massacre in the camps,” the Kahan Commission concluded that “it is impossible to justify [Sharon´s] disregard of the danger of a massacre” because “no prophetic powers were required to know that a concrete danger of acts of slaughter existed when the Phalangists were moved into the camps without the I.D.F.´s being with them.” In fact, the Commission found: “In our view, everyone who had anything to do with events in Lebanon should have felt apprehension about a massacre in the camps, if armed Phalangist forces were to be moved into them without the I.D.F. exercising concrete and effective supervision and scrutiny of them…. To this backdrop of the Phalangists´ [enmity] toward the Palestinians [in the camps] were added the profound shock [of Bashir Jemayel´s recent death]….” The Kahan Commission further found that: If in fact the Defense Minister, when he decided that the Phalangists would enter the camps without the I.D.F. taking part in the operation, did not think that that decision could bring about the very disaster that in fact occurred, the only possible explanation for this is that he disregarded any apprehensions about what was to be expected because the advantages . . . to be gained from the Phalangists´ entry into the camps distracted him from the proper consideration in this instance. The Commission explained that “if the decision were taken with the awareness that the risk of harm to the inhabitants existed, the obligation existed to adopt measures which would ensure effective and ongoing supervision by the I.D.F. over the actions of the Phalangists at the site, in such a manner as to prevent the danger or at least reduce it considerably. The Defense Minister issued no order regarding the adoption of such measures.” The Commission concluded: “In our view, the Minister of Defense made a grave mistake when he ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population in the refugee camps.” As its ultimate recommendation, the Kahan Commission recommended that Sharon be discharged from serving as Minister of Defense, and that, if necessary, the then-Prime Minister should consider removing him from office. * * * Human Rights Watch takes the position that what happened at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, and that all those responsible need to be brought to justice. Enough questions are raised by the Kahan Commission report to warrant a criminal investigation by Israel into whether former Defense Minister Sharon and other Israeli military officials—including some who knew the massacre was occurring but took no actions to stop it—bear criminal responsibility. The findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, cannot substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that will bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. The Lebanese government should institute a similar investigation into the Sabra and Shatilla massacre.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/06/21/letter-president-bush","Letter to President Bush","Letter to President Bush","Execution of Mentally Retarded","06/21/2001","The United States is the only country whose jurisprudence expressly  permits such executions and which carries them out with distressing frequency, as documented in our recent  report, Beyond Reason: The Death Penalty and Offenders with Mental Retardation. An adult with mental retardation who commits a murder should be held legally accountable, assuming the retardation is not so profound as to render him or her incompetent to stand trial. But the death penalty is always disproportionate to the moral culpability of the mentally retarded. The mentally retarded have limited abilities to learn, reason, plan, understand, judge, and discriminate. They have trouble understanding abstract concepts, including moral ones. They have a truncated capacity to think about intended actions, to consider their possible consequences, and to exercise mature control over their conduct. Given their limited cognitive abilities, the mentally retarded should never be placed in the category of the most culpable offenders for whom the death penalty is ostensibly reserved.  People with mental retardation are also uniquely vulnerable to miscarriages of justice in criminal trials. They are susceptible to suggestion, eager to please, and readily acquiesce to other adults or authority figures, including the police. These characteristics lead them to waive their rights to remain silent and, in some cases, even to make false confessions. Beyond Reason includes a number of cases in which men with mental retardation have confessed to crimes they did not commit and have spent years on death row before their innocence was ultimately established. Indeed, just last week a mentally retarded man who confessed to and was convicted of six murders was released from prison in Florida after DNA tests showed he could not have committed the crimes.  In 1989, in Penry v. Lynaugh, the U.S. Supreme Court in a five to four decision ruled that executing the mentally retarded did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Justice O'Connor's majority opinion relied heavily on the absence of a national consensus against such executions for her conclusion that U.S. standards of decency had not evolved enough to warrant a constitutional prohibition. At the time, only two states forbade the death penalty for the mentally retarded. Since then, fifteen states and the federal government have enacted legislation that prohibits such executions. Bills with similar measures have passed the Missouri and Connecticut legislatures and are awaiting the governors' signatures. Public opinion polls consistently show a preponderance of the American people, even those who otherwise support the death penalty, believes that executing the mentally retarded is wrong. They recognize, as does the rest of the world, that accountability and public safety can be secured through punishment short of death and that executing people of limited cognitive abilities is not necessary to advance the putative goal of deterrence.  This spring, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case of McCarver v. North Carolina. Petitioner Ernest McCarver, a man with mental retardation, is asking the Court to overturn the Penry decision and to rule that the constitution prohibits the execution of mentally retarded offenders. In light of the number of mentally retarded individuals who continue to be sentenced to death in the U.S., such a ruling is needed to guarantee this barbaric practice is banned from the nation. A brief from the solicitor general urging a constitutional prohibition against executing the retarded would be an invaluable contribution to the outcome of the case.  Again, we commend you for placing your administration on record as opposing the execution of mentally retarded offenders. However terrible the crimes committed by a person with mental retardation, his or her execution is unacceptable in a civilized nation.  Sincerely,  Kenneth Roth Executive Director","United States",""

According to Human Rights Watch, the United States is the only country known to execute mentally retarded offenders and whose jurisprudence expressly permits such executions. Of the 38 death penalty states, 23 permit such executions. In March, Human Rights Watch published """"Beyond Reason: The Death Penalty and Offenders with Mental Retardation,"""" a report documenting numerous examples of offenders with significant cognitive disabilities who have been sentenced to death.  """"Executing the mentally retarded is senseless cruelty,"""" said Jamie Fellner, associate counsel at Human Rights Watch and author of Beyond Reason. """"A constitutional ruling is needed to ban this barbaric practice nationwide.""""  The Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the execution of mentally retarded offenders was not prohibited by the eighth amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The court held there was no national consensus against such executions, as evidenced by the fact that only two states had legislatively prohibited them.  Since then, the number of states with legislative prohibitions has grown to 15 in addition to the federal government and public opinion polls consistently reveal a preponderance of Americans - including those who support the death penalty - believe it is wrong to execute offenders who have mental retardation. In March the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal of Ernest McCarver, a man with the mind of a ten-year-old on North Carolina's death row who has asked the Court to reconsider its 1989 decision.

He was rearrested on 5 June 2001 and taken to the lock up of the National Security Agency (Agence Nationale des renseignements, ANR). One week after he was transferred to the central prison of Makala where he is detained together with people suspected of involvement in the assassination of President Laurent Desire Kabila.

On June 14, outspoken opposition leader Chbih Cheikh Ould Malainine and two colleagues, Mokhtar Ould Haibetna and Bouba Ould Hassan, were convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for alleged involvement with terrorist groups and a Libyan coup plot. Chbih Cheikh Ould Malainine, the leader of the opposition Popular Front and presidential candidate in the 1997 elections, was detained on April 8, 2001. The charges against Malainine, backed by little if any substantive evidence, appear to be politically motivated.

Human Rights Watch is concerned that the charges against Chbih Ould Cheikh Malainine, Mokhtar Ould Haibetna and Bouba Ould Hassan, were politically motivated. A presidential candidate in the 1997 elections, Chbih is chairman of the opposition Popular Front (Front Populaire, FP). He was arrested at his home on April 8, 2001, accused of being involved with alleged terrorist groups, and an alleged Libyan coup plot. It appears that there was little if any substantive evidence to back these charges. On June 14, Malainine was convicted on these charges and sentenced to five years in prison. His lawyers plan to appeal the judgment. We urge you to ensure that any appeal is heard without any appearance of interference from the executive branch of government. Malainine's lawyers should be assured the rights they are due under international law to free and confidential consultation with their client and to represent him in court without harassment. His case was heard in Aioun, about 800km south-east of the capital, Nouakchott, following protests in Nouakchott where it should normally have been heard. Security forces used teargas to disrupt a rally in Nouakchott on April 25, 2001, organized by the Popular Front to protest the arrest. Following his transfer, the lawyers representing Malainine temporarily withdrew in protest, citing interference in their right to communicate with their client, though ultimately a team of sixteen lawyers led by the president of the bar council formed the defense team at the trial. The trial was held under close police surveillance and there are serious concerns about lack of respect for due process during the proceedings. Evidence presented against the defendants consisted of their own signed statements, which they alleged had been obtained under duress, and two prosecution witnesses dismissed by the court as unreliable. Two of the judges hearing the case withdrew from the court at different times in contravention of court procedure. We are also concerned that trial observers from the Fédération internationale des ligues des droits de l'homme and the Moroccan Bar Association were prevented from attending the trial.

We are concerned that your government has in the last year stepped up repression by curbing press freedom, banning the Union des forces democratiques-Ère nouvelle party, led by Ahmed Ould Daddah, and teargassing and disrupting public protests. Last year several opposition members were detained, including Daddah.

""""Once again, the Cambodian judicial system is in the spotlight, and once again, it has failed to give a fair hearing to those on trial,"""" the two human rights organizations said. """"No one questions the need to bring suspected criminals to justice, but even the most basic safeguards for the rights of defendants have been absent from these proceedings."""" The high profile trial of thirty-two suspects (two of whom are being tried in absentia) opened in Phnom Penh on 11 June, amid intimidating security arrangements. Family members, journalists and human rights monitors were denied access to the courtroom in the initial stages of the trial, while heavily armed police, soldiers and military police with dogs packed the courtroom and the surrounding area. The verdict is expected to be announced on 22 June. Fair trial procedures had been breached long before the case reached the courtroom. The suspects were arrested following an attack in Phnom Penh in November 2000, which left eight people dead and fourteen injured. Lawyers for some of the accused were prevented from holding confidential meetings with their clients in the period before the trial, effectively denying the defendants the right to fair trials by limiting the lawyers' ability to prepare a defence. In addition, Cambodian law limits pre-trial detention to a maximum period of six months, which expired weeks before the trial began. Faced with the intimidating situation in the courtroom, most of the lawyers for the accused boycotted the proceedings after the first day, citing breaches of proper procedures. The judge proceeded to appoint two new lawyers to act for all of the accused, and refused to delay the hearing, although these lawyers never had the opportunity to meet their new clients and were thus unable to prepare any sort of defence at all. """"Justice is not served by court processes which ignore the rights of the accused, undermine the role of their lawyers, and intimidate their families,"""" the rights groups said. """"The dignity of the court and the interests of justice have been sacrificed for a flawed legal process, which is in nobody's best interests."""" Background On 23 November 2000, a group of armed men from the Cambodian Freedom Fighters (CFF) movement launched an attack on the Ministry of Defence and the Council of Ministers building in Phnom Penh, and a military base on the outskirts of the capital. Eight people were killed and at least fourteen more were injured. In the days following the attack, more than 200 people were arrested throughout Cambodia on suspicion of involvement in the CFF. While most of these people were never charged and were subsequently released, more than sixty remain in detention. Thirty suspects were brought to trial on 11 June 2001 on charges of conspiracy, terrorism, and membership of an illegal armed group. The charges carry a maximum penalty of life in prison. Two more defendants at the 11 June trial, Chhun Yasith and Thong Samien, are believed to be in the United States, and were tried in absentia.

In language agreed to by Canada, Australia, and several Latin American and European countries, the draft declaration makes explicit the goal of reducing incidence among """"men who have sex with men, sex workers, [and] injecting drug users and their sexual partners,"""" as well as prisoners and refugees. The United States proposes striking this list and replacing it with the vague and anodyne phrase, """"vulnerable individuals,"""" including those engaging in """"risky sexual behavior."""" The Vatican prefers a similarly euphemistic reference to """"people who have multiple sex partners."""" Egypt suggests substituting the judgmental phrase, """"homosexuality among men, prostitution, and other forms of irresponsible sexual behavior.""""  """"HIV/AIDS is born in large part of discrimination against women, gay men, drug users, sex workers, and others whose status has impeded their access to services, information, and social support,"""" said Joanne Csete, a public health expert on AIDS at Human Rights Watch. """"Pretending that these groups don't exist, or reinforcing discrimination against them, will only accelerate the spread of the epidemic by pushing them further underground and out of reach of the services they desperately need to contain the disease.""""  Csete is the author of a report on violations of the rights of AIDS orphans in Kenya, to be released next week.  Violation of civil and political rights is the engine that spreads HIV/AIDS in many parts of the world. Where women are unable to negotiate the terms of their sexual relations, where gay men and sex workers are marginalized and excluded from services, and where sexual violence is prevalent, HIV/AIDS flourishes. In negotiations earlier this month, the United States nonetheless rejected a proposal by the European Union and the Rio Group that the declaration adopt a """"rights-based approach"""" to combating HIV/AIDS.  """"If governments attempt to fight HIV/AIDS without addressing the rights violations that fuel the epidemic and result from it, they will be doing only half the job—or less,"""" said Csete.  The draft declaration of the AIDS conference was meant to be completed in preparatory meetings ending May 25 at which civil society organizations were present. However, since then, discussions have continued over contentious points in closed-door sessions attended only by governments.  """"The independent voices most likely to highlight the role of human rights abuse in the spread of HIV/AIDS have been excluded from these deliberations,"""" said Roth. """"Sadly, governments seem determined to shut out uncomfortable messages, even at the risk of a less effective strategy for fighting this deadly disease.""""","Middle East/North Africa, United States, Egypt, Global","Health, Health Care Access, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

Human Rights Watch expressed grave concern that the related flogging sentence against journalist Abd al-Jabbar Saad, convicted on defamation charges, may be implemented in the near future. """"This sentence is another indication of the increasing limitations on press freedom in Yemen,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Charges of defamation are being used on a regular basis to silence journalists and close down newspapers.""""  On June 11, 2001 the Press and Publications branch of the Prosecutor-General's office notified Al-Shura that it would proceed to implement a 1997 judgment passed against the newpaper's editor, Abdallah Saad, who died in 1999, and his journalist-brother, Abd al-Jabbar Saad. A court had convicted the paper, published by the opposition party Union of Popular Forces, on defamation charges in May 1997. The court ordered the paper closed down for six months and the journalists barred from writing for a year.  Additionally, the court sentenced the journalists to eighty lashes each for defaming Abd al-Majid al-Zindani, a leader of Al-Islah, the country's leading Islamist party. The court also awarded al-Zindani YR 100.000 (US$ 625) in damages, maintaining that the defendants were unable to prove the published allegations of adultery against al-Zindani; such unproven allegations carry a sentence of eighty lashes under the Penal Code. After a process of appeal, the Supreme Court upheld the verdict in May 2000.  Judicially sanctioned corporal punishments, such as floggings, are a form of torture or ill-treatment and are banned under international law. In 1992 the human rights committee, the authoritative United Nations body for interpreting the international covenant on civil and political rights, specifically stated that such a prohibition """"must extend to corporal punishment, including excessive chastisement as a punishment?""""  """"We are very disturbed at the possibility that in Yemen journalists may be flogged for their writings,"""" said Megally """"We are seeking urgent assurances that this will not happen.""""  In September 1999, Al-Shura was closed by the Ministry of Information for allegedly failing to notify the ministry of a change in the editorial board. This and previous closure orders in February 1999 and May 1998 embroiled the paper in litigation with the Ministry of Information until August 2000, when it resumed publication.  Press freedom in Yemen has deteriorated since the end of the civil war in 1994. Ten papers were brought to court during 2000; some of them periodically suspended and the journalists fined. Yemen Times journalist Hasan al-Zaidi remains detained in an undisclosed location after the Political Security Office, an agency directly reporting to the president, arrested him on June 10, 2001. In late May, Al-Shumu', a weekly, was banned for one month and chief editor Saif al-Hadheri sentenced to six months imprisonment and the payment of damages after the Sanaa Appeals Court had convicted him of defaming the former Minister of Education by accusing him of embezzlement and corruption.  Under the regulations for the 1990 Press Law, issued in 1993 and 1998, newspapers have to apply to the Ministry of Information for annual renewal of their license. According to the Ministry, in mid-2000 only about half of Yemen's two hundred publications had been granted a license.","Middle East/North Africa, Yemen","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

China's detention of four intellectuals of Chinese descent with ties to the U.S. poses a serious challenge to U.S.-China relations. In addition, another prominent scholar with links to Hong Kong and a businessman who is a permanent U.S. resident and is reported to be extremely ill have been detained. Two of the scholars have thus far been accused of spying, although no evidence has been produced by the Chinese government to justify the charges. Those detained include: Dr. Li Shaomin, a U.S. citizen, who teaches business at the City University of Hong Kong. He was detained on February 25, 2001 while on his way to Shenzhen where he operated a commercial website. On May 15, the authorities said he was being charged with spying for Taiwan, but have thus far produced no details of the charges. American consular officials have had regular access to him, but Chinese authorities refuse to allow him to meet with his lawyer nor have they revealed where he is being held. Dr. Li is a prominent sociologist whose work focuses on the issues raised in China's privatizing of its economy and on the use of advertising. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University and was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. Dr. Li worked as a consultant for several major Western corporations interested in doing business in China.   Dr. Gao Zhan, a U.S. permanent resident and research scholar based at American University in Washington, D.C. She was detained on February 11, 2001, and on March 27 was formally accused of spying for unspecified """"overseas intelligence agencies."""" The Chinese government says she has confessed to the charges, but no evidence has been provided to support this claim. Her lawyers have been unable to obtain access to her, and her husband, Xue Donghua, has strenuously denied the charges against her. In contravention of the U.S.-China consular agreement, the couple's five year old son, a U.S. citizen, was detained and separated from his parents for 26 days without any notification to U.S. officials. Later both Dr. Gao's husband and son were released and allowed to return home. Dr. Gao's academic work focused on Chinese students, especially women, who return to China after a period abroad.  Wu Jianmin, a U.S. citizen and former Hong Kong resident. He was detained in Shenzhen on April 8, 2001. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, he was suspected of being involved in collecting information endangering state security. Mr. Wu had worked as an editor at China News and contributed articles to the now-defunct newspaper Express News for a short period in 1996. He also published articles in the Hong Kong newspaper """"Apple Daily"""" between 1995 and 1999. A former staff member at the Communist Party School in Beijing, Wu migrated to the U.S. in 1988. U.S. consular officials have had access to him, but his family and lawyers, as far as we know, have been prevented from seeing him. No charges have been officially filed.  Qin Guangguang, a U.S. permanent resident. He was detained on December 12, 2000 and is being held by the Ministry of State Security. Qin graduated from China's Central Ethnic University and came to this country in 1989. He has been a visiting scholar at the University of Michigan, University of Chicago, and Stanford University. According to Radio Free Asia, in 1994 he was hired as the Beijing representative for an American pharmaceutical group. No charges have been filed against him, and as far as we know, U.S. consular officials and his family have had no access to him. Dr. Xu Zerong, formerly a student at Harvard University, with a Ph.D. from Oxford University. Dr. Xu was active in sociological research and helped to publish the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly in Hong Kong. He emigrated to Hong Kong in 1985. He was detained last fall when he returned to the mainland to assume positions as an associate research professor at Guangdong Provincial Academy of Sciences and as an affiliated professor at Zhongshan University. He is known for his work on the role of the People's Liberation Army in the Korean War. His current whereabouts and legal status are unknown. His family and lawyers have been denied access to him.  Liu Yaping, a permanent U.S. resident. Mr. Liu is a businessman and resident of Weston, Conn. He was detained on March 8, 2001 in the city of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. He had gone to China to start a business to design websites and was accused of tax evasion and other economic crimes; charges were formally brought on April 15. However, his family and other sources say he became entangled in a local power struggle. His lawyers have seen him only twice, both times briefly and in heavily monitored circumstances. They reported that he looks very ill. Doctors have told Liu's family that he has vision and speech problems, headaches and vomiting, and that he is suffering from an aneurysm in an artery leading to the brain, a potentially fatal condition. Chinese authorities have been urged to release Mr. Liu on bail for medical treatment, but have not agreed to the request.    Response of the Academic Community:  The detentions of respected China scholars have sent a shock wave through the international academic community. Many researchers are increasingly worried about the risks of working in China, and have taken extraordinary steps to speak out.  --On April 17, more than 400 leading scholars from fourteen countries as well as Taiwan and Hong Kong, all of whom work in the field of China studies, sent a petition to President Jiang Zemin. (The appeal was supported by the NY Academy of Sciences Committee for Human Rights, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Sociological Association, and Human Rights Watch's Academic Freedom Committee.) They expressed concern about the vague reasons for the detentions, and called on President Jiang to demonstrate China's commitment to human rights and academic freedom by either immediately releasing the scholars or promptly giving them an opportunity to defend themselves in a court of law with international standards of due process. By signing this appeal, these scholars could risk losing their own access to China, but they apparently believe the risk is worth taking to make this statement of principle.  Their appeal cites China's obligations as a signatory of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (not yet ratified) and as a party to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by Beijing this past February. The latter document says in Article 15, """"The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity."""" The detentions clearly violate the fundamental rights guaranteed in these U.N. treaties and """"will likely deter other academics, especially but by no means only those of Chinese nationality, from freely pursuing their research in and about China for fear of suffering the same treatment.""""  --In early May, when Jiang Zemin went to Hong Kong to speak at an international business forum, over 100 Hong Kong scholars issued a public appeal on behalf of the detained scholars. This was an exceptionally risky and brave initiative. They stressed that the detentions have had """"a particularly strong impact on scholars based in Hong Kong who travel to the Mainland regularly for professional and personal reasons. Many scholars have recently canceled their trips to the Mainland and others have put on hold their planned academic projects to be conducted in China. . . Given the vital role scholarly exchanges and scholarship have played in China's modernization efforts and their continued importance for China's success in the world of nations, we respectfully urge the Mainland authorities to indicate China's commitment to pursue the course of the rule of law...by releasing those scholars immediately or by identifying with sufficient particulars the illegal acts"""" they allegedly committed.  I would add that I visited Hong Kong briefly in April. Legislators, U.S. businesspeople, lawyers, NGOs and the U.S. consul-general all expressed deep concern about the detentions of Hong Kong-based academics. This issue is a crucial test of the """"one country, two systems"""" formula for the SAR. If Hong Kong is totally powerless to protect its citizens from arbitrary arrest the minute they cross the border into the mainland, this poses a serious challenge to Hong Kong's long-term viability and autonomy. Yet Hong Kong officials I met, including the SAR solicitor general, Mr. Bob Alcock, seemed strangely indifferent to the detentions. And last week, when he was questioned by the Hong Kong legislature, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa downplayed concern about the detentions, declaring that academic exchanges with the mainland are in no way threatened. If anyone was arrested, it was because they were involved in """"spying"""" and this was not a violation of academic freedom, he said.  The """"Rule of Law""""  The detentions raise serious questions about the rule of law in China and whether it exists. There are safeguards in Chinese law which theoretically guarantee detainees access to counsel, limit the amount of time that can elapse between the date of detention and when the case is turned over to the procuracy for preparation of formal charges, and so on. But the law also contains many loopholes in cases involving """"state secrets,"""" subversion or espionage that allow security officials to hold any individual with virtual impunity and limited or no outside access.  Such arbitrary treatment in China is hardly unusual in a system in which the laws are applied in an unpredictable, inconsistent manner, where there are only extremely vague and open-ended definitions of """"spying"""" and """"state secrets,"""" and there is no independent judiciary. In April, the State Department issued a warning that Chinese state security officials may be deliberately targeting Chinese-American citizens or residents, especially those who have criticized Beijing or visited Taiwan.  The scholars may be victims of an internal Chinese political struggle, or pawns in a game Beijing is playing to test the new administration of George W. Bush. Perhaps China intends to interrogate them, then release them at a convenient time to try to gain international credit. In the worst case scenario, they could face secret trials, without any due process under international standards, and be sentenced to prison terms with little prospect for early release.  Human Rights Conditions in China  It's important to recognize the context in which these detentions have taken place. I would like to briefly describe the overall political climate and general human rights conditions in China today.  The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party seems obsessed with maintaining its grip on political power, while at the same time trying to prop up its credibility by promoting economic reforms and market openings. The preoccupation with preserving social stability is a perennial aspect of one-party rule, but it has been fueled in recent years by a rise in worker and farmer protests, serious urban unemployment, and separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. It is also related to the succession struggle now underway in Beijing in the run up to next year's Communist Party Congress.  Last December, as China's leaders became increasingly worried about growing social unrest, top officials began sounding the alarm, warning that China's entry into the World Trade Organization might trigger even greater unrest and instability. Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Party's Central Committee, urged public security and judicial departments to crack down on """"hostile forces both at home and abroad, elements that undermine ethnic unity, key members of cult organizations, criminal offenders and economic crime offenders,"""" according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency (December 2, 2000).  Then, this past January, police officials called on all cities to beef up their anti-riot police, complaining that existing anti-riot police were poorly trained and equipped and """"hardly capable of maintaining social peace and stability."""" Following the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, a paramilitary police force was created to handle large-scale protests. China's major cities are required to create anti-riot units of at least 300 officers. Meanwhile, the city of Beijing, as part of its bid to host the Olympics in 2008, has touted the creation of a new anti-terrorist squad, designed to prevent terrorist groups from disrupting the games.  The leadership gathered for a two-day National Public Order Work Meeting in Beijing on April 2, and, on April 3, President Jiang Zemin announced the launching of another major """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign, making it clear that the authorities are determined to preserve social stability at all costs. The first such anti-crime campaign took place in 1983. Local authorities are given broad discretion to crack down on organized crime and corruption, suspected separatists, dissidents and others, using expedited arrest, trial and sentencing procedures. In the past, these campaigns have resulted in large-scale human rights abuses as even the minimal protections and legal safeguards in Chinese law are disregarded, and arbitrary arrests and summary executions become routine.  """"The drive is not an expedient response to the recent explosions and other violent crimes, but a long-term endeavor to achieve the ultimate goal of improving China's public order,"""" said Xiao Yang, president of People's Supreme Court, according to Xinhua.  Already there has been an upsurge in arrests and executions. Amnesty International has cited China as the world's leading executioner, with at least 1,263 executions in 1999 and 2,088 death sentences, many obtained through unfair trials and the use of torture to extract confessions. Many are given the death sentence for violent crimes. With the """"Strike Hard"""" campaign underway, the government-controlled media is putting the public spotlight on the tough official response. On one day alone in April, it said, at least 37 persons were executed and 50 sentenced to death in several cities across the country. Mass rallies took place in cities in Guangdong province to announce the formal arrests of 5,485 people """"suspected of involvement in organized crime, drug trafficking, and murder,"""" the official media declared.  But even before """"Strike Hard,"""" throughout the year 2000 the Chinese government systematically suppressed independent political activities of all kinds. It tightened controls on the Internet, and increased restrictions on unofficial religious activity as potentially subversive, while singling out the Falun Gong meditation group for particularly harsh repression. Members of the China Democracy Party have been given prison terms ranging from less than five years to thirteen years.  Some of the worst abuses continued to occur in the ethnic areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang. In Tibet, Chinese authorities suppressed suspected """"splittist"""" activities and exerted control over Tibet Buddhist religious institutions. Detention of monks and nuns for their peaceful pro-independence activities continued. China's vice president, Hu Jintao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March, said that """"while legal religious activities...will be protected, illegal activities under the cover of religion must be resolutely stopped and punished according to law.""""  In Xinjiang, the """"Strike Hard"""" campaign is aimed at suspected religious fundamentalists, violent terrorists, and """"splittists."""" Last September, Premier Zhu Rongji visited Xinjiang and called for an """"iron fist"""" approach to such groups. Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about Rebiya Kadeer, sentenced last March to eight years in prison. Once again, we call for her immediate and unconditional release and the release of her secretary, Kahriman Abdukerim, serving a three-year administrative sentence. Ms. Kadeer's son was freed from a reeducation through labor camp this past February.  U.S. Government Response and HRW's Recommendations:  We welcomed President Bush's public statement on May 11, urging China to treat fairly U.S. citizens who have been detained; he also expressed support for expanded economic ties with China. Earlier, when Vice Premier Qian Qichen visited Washington, DC, President Bush raised the detention of Dr. Gao directly with Qian. If China is to be a reliable trading partner, the rule of law is essential, and China's government must demonstrate its willingness to observe international rules and standards. This includes international rules and standards -- which Beijing says it supports -- governing respect for fundamental human rights.  Last week, the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick, at a meeting in Shanghai, warned his Chinese counterpart that the mistreatment of Chinese-Americans visiting his country could create problems in the upcoming Congressional debate on renewal of China's trading status. """"We still have differences with China,"""" he said at a press conference, """"We have differences in security matters. We have differences in the treatment of our nationals and residents.""""  Clearly, the administration should continue to speak up, and work through private diplomatic channels at senior levels to quickly clarify and resolve these cases. The international academic community should continue its advocacy. But more must be done. We would recommend the following initiatives:  1) Appointment of a special envoy:  The President should immediately appoint a special, personal envoy to travel to Beijing to discuss the plight of the detained intellectuals and other urgent cases, their legal status and humanitarian needs. His envoy should make it clear at the highest levels that these detentions could spoil the atmosphere for President Bush's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Cooperation (APEC) forum in Shanghai in late October. The White House should indicate that President Bush will be unable to accept the invitation for a state visit to Beijing unless China clarifies these cases, and releases those being held solely for the exercise of their rights of belief, free expression and association. The administration should also insist on broader progress on human rights and religious freedom prior to the president's planned visit.  This message can be reinforced when Secretary of State Colin Powell travels to Vietnam late next month for the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) annual meetings, and will likely have an opportunity to meet with the Chinese foreign minister.  The administration should approach other countries with close ties to Beijing -- including China's other major trading partners and those conducting bilateral human rights """"dialogues"""" with China such as Canada, Australia, Japan, and the European Union -- to ask for their assistance with private diplomatic appeals.  2) Congressional action:  Several members of Congress have written to President Jiang about the detentions. I urge members of this Committee to directly contact the Chinese ambassador and in other ways communicate their concerns to Chinese authorities. A """"sense of the Congress"""" resolution expressing deep concern and calling for action by the Chinese government -- and the U.S. administration -- would certainly be helpful.  Under the PNTR (Permanent Normal Trade Relations) bill enacted last year, a Congressional-Executive Commission on China was created to promote human rights, labor rights, religious freedom and the rule of law. Thus far, the Senate leadership has appointed members, and I hope that the House leadership and the executive branch will move quickly to get all the commission members in place. Sen. Chuck Hagel was appointed as chair by Senator Lott. The commission should take up the cases of the detained scholars as one of its first urgent matters of business, and perhaps convene a panel of distinguished jurists and academics to lend their assistance.  3) Business community:  Several of those detained have strong connections with the U.S. business community. Some have worked for U.S. companies. American businesspeople should use their personal contacts in Beijing to protest the detentions and underline the chilling affect these actions have on those doing research related to China's economic development, as well as the negative impact on relations between the U.S. and China. A delegation of CEO's might travel to Beijing to deliver this message as a group.  Companies involved in the planning of a CEO forum in Shanghai at the APEC meeting should repeatedly raise these cases in all of their meetings with Chinese officials involved in APEC.","Asia, United States, China and Tibet",""

We are writing today to convey Human Rights Watch's concerns about Yugoslavia's continued failure to cooperate with the Tribunal and in particular to provide an assessment of the draft Law on Cooperation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the International Criminal Tribunal (the """"Draft Law"""") that is being considered in Belgrade.   When Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica was in Washington he repeatedly cited the adoption of a law as the necessary precondition for cooperation with the Tribunal. Human Rights Watch, however, has never believed that the adoption of a cooperation law was necessary for Yugoslavia to arrest and surrender the individuals indicted by the Tribunal. Recently, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and other officials have acknowledged this fact. The real test of Yugoslavia's cooperation rests in the willingness to arrest and surrender those indicted by the Tribunal. As you know, no such surrenders have occurred since your April certification that Belgrade was cooperating with the Tribunal. Moreover, for the reasons elaborated below, we believe the Draft Law currently being considered in Belgrade has many loopholes and ambiguities that will obstruct the Tribunal's work. Although the law was drafted to be submitted for adoption to the Yugoslav Parliament, the concerns addressed in this Human Rights Watch analysis also would apply if the authorities in Belgrade instead submit it to the Serbian Parliament. The Draft Law can only be seen as further evidence of a lack of will to cooperate with the Tribunal.   General Provisions Section   The Draft Law compares negatively with the relevant provisions of Slovenia's law on cooperation with the Tribunal. The Slovenian legislation acknowledges the primacy of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It states explicitly that """"proceedings before the International Tribunal shall always have precedence over proceedings relating to the same matter before a Slovenian court."""" By contrast, in the Yugoslav Draft Law there is no acknowledgement of the primacy of the Tribunal over proceedings in Yugoslav courts nor any acknowledgement of Yugoslavia's overarching obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal.   The Draft Law states that """"[a] request for cooperation or the realization of certain decisions by the International Criminal Tribunal shall be accepted if it is based on the provisions of the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal and if it does not contravene the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia."""" (emphasis added.)   Given this wording, it is unclear which entity has the ultimate authority to decide whether a Tribunal request is based on the provisions of the Tribunal's Statute and Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The language could be construed to empower the Yugoslav courts to determine not only whether a request for cooperation contravenes the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also whether the Tribunal is acting in accordance with its own Statute and Rules. This interpretation would make the Yugoslav judiciary the master of the Tribunal's competence. Such a relationship blatantly reverses the obligations of United Nations member states articulated in Security Council Resolution 827 (1993). This ambiguity highlights the need for amendments throughout the Draft Law to clarify the authority of the Tribunal and give it full effect.   The Draft Law further states that the Tribunal """"cannot act in a way that would jeopardize Yugoslavia's sovereignty or national security interests."""" Because some may consider the type of crimes the Tribunal will be prosecuting as relevant to issues of sovereignty, these particular criteria are inappropriate and bound to cause conflict and delay. It is significant that neither """"sovereignty"""" nor """"national security interests"""" appear in the corresponding Slovenian or Croatian cooperation laws.   In addition, the procedural aspects of this provision are disturbingly vague. The Draft Law provides that the government of a constituent republic may request that the Federal Minister of Justice lodge a complaint with the Tribunal that an act of cooperation could jeopardize national sovereignty or security interests. We are concerned that the Draft Law leaves unclear how any resulting conflict between Yugoslavia and the Tribunal would be resolved. Deferral of Jurisdiction to the Tribunal   The Tribunal Statute, adopted by the U.N. Security Council, gives the Tribunal authority to require a national court to defer its jurisdiction over a domestic criminal case to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Draft Law provides that a Yugoslav court shall reject a Tribunal request for deferral if the indictee has already been sentenced by a competent Yugoslav court, except for situations covered by Article 10(2) of the Tribunal's Statute. Article 10(2) provides for retrial in certain limited circumstances-namely if: (a) the act for which the person was tried was characterized as an ordinary crime; or (b) the national court proceedings """"were not impartial or independent, were designed to shield the accused from international criminal responsibility, or the case was not diligently prosecuted."""" While the reference to Article 10(2) of the Statute is appropriate, we are concerned that the Draft Law fails to clarify whether the Yugoslav court or the Tribunal would make the ultimate determination of whether the criteria set forth in that article have been met.   Of equal concern is a provision in the Draft Law specifying that Yugoslavia may reject a Tribunal deferral request if it does not pertain to the """"same crime"""" at issue in the domestic case. Yet, under the Tribunal's Rules of Procedure and Evidence, there is no such limitation on the Tribunal's authority to require national courts to defer to its jurisdiction. In fact, those Rules explicitly contemplate deferral when the Tribunal's case does not pertain to exactly the """"same crime"""" at issue in a case before domestic courts, i.e., when the domestic proceedings characterize an act under Tribunal investigation as """"an ordinary crime""""; or when the domestic case is """"closely related to, or otherwise involves significant factual or legal questions which may have implications for investigations or prosecutions before the Tribunal."""" This difference between the Draft Law and the Tribunal Rules is problematic because a deferral request that is appropriate under the Tribunal's Statute and Rules could nonetheless be rejected by Yugoslav courts pursuant to the Draft Law.   Surrender of Individuals   The most decisive section of the Draft Law enumerates the conditions required for surrendering an indictee to the Tribunal. These include confirming the identity of the person whose surrender is requested and determining that the crime falls within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Under the Draft Law, a court in a constituent republic of Yugoslavia would decide whether the conditions for surrender had been satisfied and would forward its decision to the government of the republic. The government then would decide on the surrender of the person.   By having courts and governments of constituent republics ascertain whether the alleged crime falls within the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the Draft Law creates yet another instance in which courts and government officials can potentially interfere with requests for surrender. Moreover, given that only the courts and governments of the constituent republics of Yugoslavia would be involved, and not the federal government of Yugoslavia, there is also a concern that an indictee could raise potential constitutional challenges relating to the authority of constituent republics to surrender indictees to the Tribunal.   For all these reasons, we believe the current Draft Law does not provide the legal groundwork for full and prompt cooperation between Yugoslavia and the Tribunal. In fact, the loopholes in the Draft Law could seriously delay or obstruct the kind of meaningful cooperation that the Bush Administration is on record as supporting. Human Rights Watch believes that, together, the weaknesses in the Draft Law, the Yugoslav authorities' failure to surrender any indictee to the Tribunal after March 31, 2001, and their failure to commit publicly to surrendering Milosevic, should dictate that the U.S. government will press for further postponement of the June 29 Donor Conference or withhold its participation from the meeting.

Human Rights Watch said that holding a conference raising billions in economic assistance for Yugoslavia would be inappropriate given Yugoslavia's complete failure to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. While opposing economic aid, the rights group supports continued humanitarian assistance to Yugoslavia.     In early April U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell certified that Yugoslavia was beginning to cooperate with the tribunal and therefore eligible for U.S. economic assistance. Powell announced, however, that U.S. participation in the donor conference would depend on further cooperation. Human Rights Watch has called on the European Union to adopt the same approach. Since April, the authorities in Belgrade have not arrested one person indicted by the tribunal, Human Rights Watch said. They also have made no public commitment to surrender former president Slobodan Milosevic.     """"Any claim that Yugoslavia has made progress on cooperation would be patently false,"""" said Richard Dicker, director of the International Justice Program at Human Rights Watch. """"This is the moment for the international community to insist on full cooperation.""""     The Bush administration is reported to have communicated to the Yugoslav authorities in late May the conditions necessary for U.S. participation in the donors' conference. These include passing a law authorizing cooperation with the war crimes tribunal, sending more of the indicted individuals to The Hague, and starting the process that will surrender Slobodan Milosevic to the war crimes tribunal. Not even one of these steps has been taken.     Prior to his visit to the United States in May 2001, Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica repeatedly denigrated the Hague tribunal as a politicized and anti-Serb court. During his visit President Kostunica changed the tenor of his criticism in public appearances and claimed that Yugoslavia would adopt a cooperation law as a first step towards full cooperation with the tribunal.     Human Rights Watch has never believed that the adoption of a cooperation law was necessary for Yugoslavia to arrest and surrender the individuals indicted by the tribunal. Recently Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and several Yugoslav officials have acknowledged that no law is necessary to transfer Milosevic and other indictees to the Hague.     This week the federal cabinet submitted a law on cooperation to the federal parliament. In a detailed analysis of the draft law sent today to U.S. and E.U. officials, Human Rights Watch pointed to several loopholes that could seriously delay or obstruct meaningful cooperation.     """"Not only is this law unnecessary, the draft itself represents a step backward, not forward,"""" said Dicker.     The draft law does not acknowledge Yugoslavia's overarching obligation to cooperate with the tribunal, Human Rights Watch said. The law also gives Yugoslav courts the authority to decide whether the tribunal is abiding by its own rules, said the rights group. The draft states that the tribunal cannot act in a way that would """"jeopardize Yugoslavia's sovereignty or national security interests."""" It leaves unanswered who has the ultimate authority to resolve any disagreement between the tribunal and the government of Yugoslavia on these issues.     The draft law is still under discussion in the Yugoslav parliament. In the latest version of the law, the governments of Serbia and Montenegro, the two constituent republics of Yugoslavia, have been given the authority to make the final decisions on surrendering indictees. Transferring this authority to the governments of the republics creates an opportunity for an accused to challenge the law's validity under the Yugoslav constitution, further delaying cooperation as a result.     Given the composition of Yugoslavia's parliament, this weak text is likely to get weaker in the final version. The parties opposing the transfer of Yugoslav citizens to The Hague are in the majority in the federal parliament.     """"President Kostunica has been ducking all questions about cooperating with the tribunal by saying that Yugoslavia needs this law first,"""" said Dicker. """"But if the law is not a good one, Belgrade's record on cooperating with the tribunal is not going to get any better. The real test is whether Kostunica starts handing over indictees-including Milosevic-to The Hague.""""     Slobodan Milosevic is currently detained in a Belgrade prison after his arrest on April 1 on corruption charges. Yugoslav and Serbian officials have repeatedly stated that Milosevic will be tried for domestic crimes. They have failed to clarify whether and when they intend to surrender him to the war crime tribunal in The Hague.     The tribunal indicted Milosevic and four former Serbian and Yugoslav officials for crimes against humanity in Kosovo in early 1999, as well as three Yugoslav Army officials on charges relating to the capture of Vukovar in Croatia in November 1991.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

We are writing today to convey Human Rights Watch's concerns about Yugoslavia's continued failure to cooperate with the Tribunal and in particular to provide an assessment of the draft Law on Cooperation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the International Criminal Tribunal (the Draft Law) that is being considered in Belgrade.   Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has repeatedly cited the adoption of a law as the necessary precondition for cooperation with the Tribunal. Human Rights Watch, however, has never believed that the adoption of a cooperation law was necessary for Yugoslavia to arrest and surrender the individuals indicted by the Tribunal. Recently, Serbian Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic and other officials have acknowledged this fact. The real test of Yugoslavia's cooperation rests in the willingness to arrest and surrender those indicted by the Tribunal. As you know, no such surrenders have occurred since April. Moreover, for the reasons elaborated below, we believe the Draft Law currently being considered in Belgrade has many loopholes and ambiguities that will obstruct the Tribunal's work. The Draft Law can only be seen as further evidence of a lack of will to cooperate with the Tribunal.   General Provisions Section    The Draft Law compares negatively with the relevant provisions of Slovenia's law on cooperation with the Tribunal. The Slovenian legislation acknowledges the primacy of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. It states explicitly that proceedings before the International Tribunal shall always have precedence over proceedings relating to the same matter before a Slovenian court. By contrast, in the Yugoslav Draft Law there is no acknowledgement of the primacy of the Tribunal over proceedings in Yugoslav courts nor any acknowledgement of Yugoslavia's overarching obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal.  The Draft Law states that [a] request for cooperation or the realization of certain decisions by the International Criminal Tribunal shall be accepted if it is based on the provisions of the Statute and the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the International Criminal Tribunal and if it does not contravene the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. (emphasis added.)   Given this wording, it is unclear which entity has the ultimate authority to decide whether a Tribunal request is based on the provisions of the Tribunal's Statute and Rules of Procedure and Evidence. The language could be construed to empower the Yugoslav courts to determine not only whether a request for cooperation contravenes the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also whether the Tribunal is acting in accordance with its own Statute and Rules. This interpretation would make the Yugoslav judiciary the master of the Tribunal's competence. Such a relationship blatantly reverses the obligations of United Nations member states articulated in Security Council Resolution 827 (1993). This ambiguity highlights the need for amendments throughout the Draft Law to clarify the authority of the Tribunal and give it full effect.   The Draft Law further states that the Tribunal cannot act in a way that would jeopardize Yugoslavia's sovereignty or national security interests. Because some may consider the type of crimes the Tribunal will be prosecuting as relevant to issues of sovereignty, these particular criteria are inappropriate and bound to cause conflict and delay. It is significant that neither sovereignty nor national security interests appear in the corresponding Slovenian or Croatian cooperation laws.   In addition, the procedural aspects of this provision are disturbingly vague. The Draft Law provides that the government of a constituent republic may request that the Federal Minister of Justice lodge a complaint with the Tribunal that an act of cooperation could jeopardize national sovereignty or security interests. We are concerned that the Draft Law leaves unclear how any resulting conflict between Yugoslavia and the Tribunal would be resolved.  Deferral of Jurisdiction to the Tribunal   The Tribunal Statute, adopted by the U.N. Security Council, gives the Tribunal authority to require a national court to defer its jurisdiction over a domestic criminal case to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Draft Law provides that a Yugoslav court shall reject a Tribunal request for deferral if the indictee has already been sentenced by a competent Yugoslav court, except for situations covered by Article 10(2) of the Tribunal's Statute. Article 10(2) provides for retrial in certain limited circumstances namely if: (a) the act for which the person was tried was characterized as an ordinary crime; or (b) the national court proceedings were not impartial or independent, were designed to shield the accused from international criminal responsibility, or the case was not diligently prosecuted.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/06/17/grant-clemency-juan-raul-garza","Grant Clemency to Juan Raul Garza","Grant Clemency to Juan Raul Garza","Letter to President Bush","06/17/2001","We are writing to urge you to grant clemency to Juan Raul Garza, who is scheduled to be executed Tuesday, June 19, and to commute his death sentence to life imprisonment. Mr. Garza was convicted of murdering one person and ordering the killing of two others. While he should certainly be held accountable and punished for his crimes, we support clemency for him because all state-sponsored executions are inherently cruel and violate fundamental human rights. In addition, Mr. Garza's execution, if carried out now, would violate the government's obligation to ensure that all criminal punishments are sought and applied fairly, with reasonable uniformity, and without intentional or unintentional bias or discrimination. There can be no justification for proceeding with an execution when serious questions about the fairness of the federal death penalty system remain unresolved.  Last September, the Department of Justice released the results of its initial inquiry into the administration of the federal death penalty, documenting stark racial and geographic disparities: 80 percent of the cases submitted by federal prosecutors for death penalty review during the five-year-period studied involved racial minorities as defendants and fewer than ten percent of federal districts accounted for some 43 percent of prosecutorial recommendations of the death penalty. Last December, President Clinton granted Mr. Garza a temporary reprieve until June 19, 2001 to give the Department of Justice time to explain those disparities. Currently, of the twenty prisoners on federal death row, seventeen are members of minority groups.  On June 6, the Justice Department issued a supplemental report concluding there was no evidence that minority defendants are subjected to bias or otherwise disfavored in decisions concerning capital punishment. That conclusion was not supported by the data in the report. Indeed, the report notes the impossibility of acquiring the data necessary for a comprehensive assessment of the fairness of the federal death penalty in the six-month period established by President Clinton. Your response should therefore be an extension of Mr. Garza's reprieve and a delay of all federal executions until such time as a proper and complete study can be completed.  For example, it is impossible to make any sound conclusions about the origins of high proportion of minorities among federal capital defendants when the Justice Department lacks racial information on the pool of death-eligible federal defendants. Federal prosecutors have great discretion to select defendants for federal capital prosecution. It is not possible to know whether the exercise of that discretion has led to unjustified racial disparities without knowing the race and crime of those they chose not to select, as well as of those whom they selected. We also note that the department's June 6 report argues that race-of-defendant discrimination does not exist, but does not consider race-of-victim discrimination, even though the earlier Justice Department report did document disparities on the basis of the victim's racial background. The new study also fails to evaluate the gross geographic differences in federal prosecutors' use of the death penalty or to evaluate the decision-making process by which some federal defendants are offered plea bargains that would spare them the death penalty and others are not.  The June 6 report suggests a reason for the disproportionate number of minorities on death row: that drug-trafficking organizations that engage in violence are disproportionately composed of members of minorities. The report does not, however, provide a breakdown of how many of the federal defendants for whom authorization for the death penalty has been sought or given committed murders connected to gangs or trafficking organizations. We note that of the twenty people currently on federal death row, only seven appear to have committed capital crimes connected to gangs or drug-trafficking. Nor does the June 6 report provide any substantiation for its claim about the racial composition of drug organizations that engage in violence. On its face, the claim seems inconsistent with federal data showing that whites commit more than 32 percent of all drug-related homicides and 56 percent of gang-related homicides. Finally, the June 6 report offers no data indicating whether the Department of Justice pursues the death penalty against white organized crime defendants who commit murder as frequently as it does against minorities who commit gang-related violence. The need for such comparative data is underscored by the fact that lawyers for Mr. Garza have compiled a list of scores of cases in which either no authorization for the death penalty was sought or pleas bargains were accepted for whites who committed murders in connection with criminal enterprises. We are troubled by the apparent conclusion of the June 6 report that there is no racial inequity in the administration of the federal death penalty because there is no evidence of discriminatory intent or actual bias on the part of federal prosecutors. The United States is, as you know, a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (CERD), an international treaty that prohibits practices that have the purpose or effect of discriminating on the basis of race. It requires remedial action whenever there is an unjustifiable disparate impact upon a racial group even in the absence of racial animus. It is thus not enough to find prosecutors are not motivated by racial considerations. Given the racial disparities that have been documented in the federal death penalty system, the department has the obligation to affirmatively establish that those disparities can be justified and that there are not alternative ways of pursuing the department's mission that would not have such a racially disparate result.  Finally, we note that Mr. Garza's death sentence arose from sentencing hearings marked by prosecutorial misconduct and procedural flaws. The jurors in his case were informed of Garza's alleged criminal behavior in Mexico, even though he was never arrested or prosecuted-much less convicted-for those crimes. In April, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organization of American States (OAS) found that this action had violated Mr. Garza's human rights, and recommended that the U.S. provide Garza with an effective remedy, including commutation. Permitting the execution of a man whose sentencing was marked by such unfairness cannot be squared with the national commitment to justice. Human Rights Watch opposes capital punishment in all circumstances because of its cruel and inhumane nature. The cornerstone of human rights is respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person. These principles cannot be reconciled with the death penalty, a form of punishment that is unique in its barbarity and finality. The intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons may be executed. Mr. Garza's case is particularly troubling because the U.S. government is prepared to execute him even though it has not been able to satisfactorily explain why such members of minorities are disproportionately represented on federal death row.  We urge you to commute Mr. Garza's sentence to life imprisonment. In the alternative, he should receive a stay of execution until the Justice Department completes its promised comprehensive study of racial and geographic disparities in the use of the federal death penalty.

The rights group called on the United Nations to make a concerted effort to obtain access to the district for verification of the reports. It also urged Taliban authorities to cooperate with a U.N. investigation and to release all arbitrarily detained civilians. """"The U.N. must press the Taliban to protect civilians and civilian property, and to hold its commanders accountable for abuses,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"No one has been held accountable for past abuses in Afghanistan - and that has contributed to massive civilian displacement and allowed further attacks on civilians to take place.""""  Control of Yakaolang has shifted several times over the last six months between the Taliban and Hizb-i Wahdat, a largely Shi'a Muslim and ethnic Hazara party in the northern-based United Front coalition. During a brief occupation of the district last January, Taliban forces summarily executed about 170 civilians in an apparent effort to punish and deter collaboration with Hizb-i Wahdat. The detentions and killings were extensively documented in a February 2001 Human Rights Watch report, """"Massacres of Hazaras in Afghanistan."""" The report can be accessed at the following web address: https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/afghanistan/ On June 5, Hizb-i Wahdat recaptured Yakaolang, ending a month-long occupation of the district by the Taliban. After retreating, Taliban forces countered with a series of air raids in which their planes reportedly bombed the administrative center of Yakaolang, including the district hospital and an aid agency office. They entered the administrative center on June 10, where the following day they were said to have carried out widespread burning of houses and public and commercial buildings. About sixty civilians who had taken refuge in outlying regions of Yakaolang were reportedly arrested, and their whereabouts remain unknown. The Taliban's Bakhtar Information Agency reported on June 10 that Mullah Dadullah, a senior Taliban field commander, was in charge of what it termed a """"mopping up"""" operation in central Yakaolang. Dadullah, whose presence in the district was confirmed by other sources, leads a unit that includes a high proportion of foreign nationals. Many of these fighters are affiliated with extremist Sunni Muslim movements, compounding the security concerns for the civilians remaining in Yakaolang, an overwhelmingly Shi'a district.  A large majority of Yakaolang's population of 60,000 - as much as 90 percent in some villages -was already displaced by the time Taliban forces retook the district on June 10, a result of continued fighting between the warring factions and the arrests and killings of civilians during the Taliban occupation in January. A majority of the residents have relocated to neighboring districts in the Hazarajat region, where they remain without humanitarian assistance. The office of the U.N. Coordinator for Afghanistan announced last month that Taliban authorities had repeatedly blocked humanitarian access to communities in need of assistance, particularly in Hazarajat.

Thousands of these workers, typically women, enter the United States every year to work for diplomats, officials of international organizations, foreign businesspeople, and U.S. citizens temporarily back in the U.S. from their homes abroad. In the fifty-six-page report, Human Rights Watch documents the cases of dozens of workers but believes that many more are exposed to some form of abuse. """"Often these employers come from a powerful, elite class, and they are abusing the rights of some of the most powerless,"""" said Carol Pier, researcher for the U.S. Program of Human Rights Watch and author of the report. """"This is a serious human rights abuse in the United States, but it has remained largely hidden from public view. This has to stop."""" The most effective recourse for workers in abusive employment relationships is to change jobs. But under U.S. law, these workers' visas are tied to their employers and in most cases they cannot legally change employers. If they leave, they lose immigration status and can be deported. In about ten percent of the cases that Human Rights Watch reviewed, workers were trafficking victims. Employers lured the workers to the United States with false promises about their employment conditions and then held them in servitude. These women worked long hours, up to nineteen per day, and were often paid less than $100 per month. They were rarely allowed outside and were prohibited from speaking to strangers. Some were physically or sexually abused. In the cases Human Rights Watch reviewed, the average hourly wage was $2.14, from which deductions for room and board might, according to U.S. law, still be made. The average workday was fourteen hours. Most of the workers were not allowed to leave their employers' homes without permission, and most were only allowed to leave on their one day off per week-Sunday. The report, """"Hidden in the Home: Abuse of Domestic Workers with Special Visas in the United States,"""" sharply criticizes the structure of the special visa programs that allow these workers to enter the U.S. No government department or agency monitors the migrant domestic worker visa programs. No laws establish specific employment conditions that must be provided these workers. Unless these workers publicly complain about employer abuse, they are ignored by the U.S. government. """"The U.S. government has developed visa programs that facilitate the abuse of migrant domestic workers,"""" said Pier. """"These workers trust that because they are following the rules and coming to the U.S. legally, the U.S. government will protect them from abuse. In too many cases, they are sadly mistaken."""" Workers who want to publicly complain face many obstacles. Most workers do not speak English and do not know where to go or how to complain. If a worker complains while still with her employer, she risks being fired and losing her legal immigration status. If she complains once she has left the employer, she is already undocumented and risks discovery by the Immigration and Naturalization Service and deportation. Even workers who sue or press charges against their employers might not find justice. The INS is not required to allow the workers to remain in the U.S. to have their day in court. Even if they are allowed to stay, the INS may deny them the right to work. Since they are also ineligible for federal public benefits, such as welfare and food assistance, survival during this time may be exceedingly difficult. If a domestic worker actually manages to sue or press charges against her employer, she finds she does not enjoy the same labor and employment protections as many other workers. Live-in domestic workers are not covered by federal laws governing overtime pay, workplace health and safety, the right to organize, and sexual harassment. Human Rights Watch called on the U.S. government to establish an effective monitoring mechanism for the visa programs, under the Department of Labor, and urged Congress to amend immigration law to include mandatory employment conditions for these workers and to allow them to transfer employers when their rights are violated. Human Rights Watch said that all workers seeking justice against their employers should be allowed to stay in the U.S. to do so and to work during that time. The rights organization also urged international institutions, such as embassies, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, whose employees hire these workers, to adopt and effectively enforce internal codes of conduct governing the workers' employment. Below are testimonies from the Human Rights Watch report """"Hidden in the Home: Abuse of Domestic Workers with Special Visas in the United States."""" Rokeya Akhatar, a Bangladeshi domestic worker employed by the family of a Middle Eastern businessman from approximately July 1998 through September 1998, told Human Rights Watch: I couldn't go out for even one second . . . I wasn't allowed to leave the house [alone] at all. [The family] told me that if I went outside, the police would arrest me because I did not have my papers [with me]. They said that without a green card, the police would arrest me. [They said] America is bad and that it would be bad if I went outside as a single woman, so I never went outside. I was like a bird in a cage. Akhatar explained that the reason that she did not have her papers was that, upon her arrival in the United States, a member of the family for whom she worked confiscated her passport. Akhatar continued, """"Now I know that I can go outside, but at that time I did not."""" According to her attorney, Akhatar left her employer's premises only once or twice during her employment to accompany a family member grocery shopping. Akhatar recounted that on those few occasions that she was allowed to leave her employer's premises, the family member """"said [I had to] cover my head and hair and not speak to anyone in Hindi."""" Fariba Ahmed is a Bangladeshi domestic worker who was employed from December 1998 through August 1999 by a representative of a Middle Eastern mission to the U.N. During her approximately nine-month employment, Ahmed was allegedly paid only $100 per month-money which she said she never saw because it was sent directly to her husband in Bangladesh. Ahmed claimed that during her employment, she performed typical household duties for her employer and cared for the couple's two children, a four-year-old boy and an infant girl, seven days a week, with no days off, for an average of fourteen hours per day-from 6:00 AM until 10:00 PM. Ahmed stated that when she arrived in the United States, her employer confiscated her passport at the airport and that during her employment she was not allowed to leave her employer's apartment alone. According to her civil complaint, Ahmed was """"allowed to leave the apartment only on two occasions, both times to go to the market to assist [her employer's wife].""""","United States, Immigrants’ Rights and Border Policy, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Child Labor, Migrant and Refugee Children, Migrants, Women's Rights, Domestic Workers, Refugees and Migrants"

Human Rights Watch said it had evidence of the practice continuing as recently as May 2001. It urged business and labor leaders, as well as member states of the International Labor Organization (ILO) now holding its annual conference in Geneva, to press the Burmese government to take immediate action to enforce the October 27, 2000 ban and verify compliance through regular access to Burma by independent monitors.  """"If Burmese authorities are serious about ending forced labor, they should mount a nationwide program to enforce their own ban,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Then they should invite independent monitors in to see for themselves.""""  Migrants coming into Thailand from Mon, Karen and Arakan States and Pegu and Rangoon Divisions told Human Rights Watch that they personally had taken part in or witnessed forced labor between February and May 2001. They said some people conscripted to work were able to avoid doing forced labor by paying off local authorities. But a migrant from the city of Martaban in Mon State told Human Rights Watch that in late April a local official (a ward-level Peace and Development Council officer) had forced him and a group of others to dig trenches; some of the workers were as young as ten years old. Several of the twenty military police supervising the work struck two men with batons and kicked them when they did not work fast enough. The witness said that resisting the order was not an option: """"If you refuse to work you could be arrested and detained,"""" he said. """"No one ever refuses--everyone is too scared.""""  The ruling Burmese State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) issued the executive order last year just prior to a decision by the ILO to call on all governments, employers, workers and UN agencies to """"review"""" their relationship with the Burmese government because of its refusal to comply with its obligations to end forced labor. Previous orders prohibiting the practice had been issued by the Burmese government in 1995 and 1999, but they were never enforced. The October 2000 order, however, for the first time stated explicitly that all violators, including military personnel, would be held accountable under the Burmese penal code. The United Nations General Assembly and UN Commission on Human Rights have repeatedly condemned forced labor in Burma.  On October 29, 2000, Burmese Foreign Minister Win Aung wrote to the director-general of the ILO and assured him that the latest order would be """"strictly enforced."""" However, there are significant obstacles to its implementation:  ?There is no evidence of prosecutions. Human Rights Watch is not aware of a single case in which a Burmese official has been sanctioned for violating the order under Section 374 of the penal code, which provides for a penalty of up to one year in prison, a fine, or both. Without a sustained effort that includes highly publicized prosecutions of those who violate the ban -- both military and civilian officials -- the SPDC's order will amount to little more than a public relations effort.  ?Public awareness of the ban is limited. The executive order was supposed to be circulated to village headmen who in turn were expected to announce the ban to local villagers. It was also reportedly published in the official Myanmar Gazette, which carries all laws and legislative orders. But most of those interviewed by Human Rights Watch had never heard of the ban. Human Rights Watch called on the SPDC regularly to publicize the order through public media, including newspapers and magazines, radio, and television, and to distribute it in ethnic minority languages as well. It said that village headmen should explain the decree and what villagers can do if local authorities fail to respond.  ?No international monitoring is allowed. The ILO has asked to station international monitors in Rangoon who would be able to conduct regular, objective assessments of conditions throughout the country. Monitors should be given guaranteed freedom of movement to all parts of Burma, including ethnic minority regions. Credible, outside monitoring is crucial to ensure that further guarantees or promises by the Burmese government are fully implemented.

Beni is the administrative capital of parts of northeastern Congo occupied by Uganda and nominally controlled by the Ugandan-backed rebel Front for the Liberation of Congo (FLC). The clashes have erupted between opposing factions of the Army for the Liberation of Congo (ALC): those loyal to the FLC's leader Jean-Pierre Bemba, and those loyal to Mbusa Nyamwisi, a local rebel leader who had left the town soon after joining forces with the FLC.  The fighting has disrupted civilian life, forcing residents to hunker down in their homes, and bringing schools, markets, and other civilian activities to a standstill. An eyewitness who fled Beni yesterday told Human Rights Watch that the population was fleeing to the surrounding bush following the arrival on the same day of five truckloads of troop reinforcements for Bemba's camp. The witness said seventeen people were killed in the market area alone, while others were hit by stray bullets as they fled. Soldiers looted the empty stands in the market after the traders fled. The official Ugandan daily New Vision on Saturday reported that fifty people were killed in the fighting. Human Rights Watch has learned that the casualties included many civilians.

The government's massive plan to reorganize life in the rural areas, known as the National Habitat Policy, decreed an end to Rwandans' customary way of living in dispersed homesteads. Many homeowners were forced to destroy their own homes and many families lived for more than a year in hovels made of sticks, mud, and banana leaves.     Some who resisted the plan were punished with fines or jail terms, the Human Rights Watch report says. The 91-page report, """"Uprooting the Rural Poor in Rwanda,"""" says that from early 1997 through the end of 2000 hundreds of thousands of Rwandans living in Kibungo, Mutara, Kigali-rural, and Ruhengeri provinces left their homes for the sites. Ninety percent of Rwandans live in the countryside and are supposed to be affected by the policy.     """"The Rwandan government has caused terrible suffering for the poor people out in the hills,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It has also made many people angry at a time when opposition political movements are growing among Rwandans inside and outside the country.""""     The policy has affected both the minority Tutsi, the people targeted by a genocide in 1994, and people of the majority Hutu ethnic group. The genocide and a simultaneous war between the then government of Rwanda and the Rwandan Patriotic Front left many widows and orphans. According to the report, many households headed by these women and children have suffered most from the enforced relocation.     Commenting on the absence of substantial protest against the relocation, one Tutsi widow told Human Rights Watch researchers, """"You can't expect us to sleep with an empty stomach and then have the strength to complain."""" Using the Kinyarwanda term for the government-designated sites, she continued, """"We need to deal with living in the umudugudu just like we deal with losing members of our family.""""     Many donors knew money given to resettle refugees who returned from exile beginning in 1994 also facilitated the rural reorganization that forced tens of thousands of people from their homes, but they continued nonetheless to deliver millions of dollars of aid.     While implementing the relocation, government authorities ordered landholders to divide their lands with returnees or even to cede them all their fields. Those who gave up all their land moved to the government-established sites where they now have only small gardens. In some cases, military officers or businessmen with government connections have appropriated large holdings of land from the poor, a practice purportedly justified by the supposedly greater productivity of larger holdings. The government is now focusing on reforming landholding rather than on forcing further villagization. It is proposing to eliminate all the small holdings of millions of poor farmers and is seeking international funding to pay for this.     """"Making agriculture more productive is imperative, but progress towards that laudable goal must not be made at the expense of the human rights,"""" said Des Forges.

At least 300,000 of these children are actively fighting in 41 countries. The 450-page survey, """"Global Report on Child Soldiers 2001,"""" is the most comprehensive study to date on the use of child soldiers. The report provides new details on military recruitment by government armed forces, civil militia, paramilitaries, and non-state armed groups in 180 countries.  The report finds that overall, the situation has improved in Latin America, the Balkans, and the Middle East in recent years, while new generations of children are at risk in Africa and parts of Asia and the Pacific.  """"We've had some movement towards a global ban on child soldiers, but we need to move faster,"""" said Jo Becker, chairperson of the Coalition and children's rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. """"The problem is not confined to developing countries in the midst of conflict.""""  Industrialized countries facing personnel shortfalls have also increased efforts to attract young recruits. The United Kingdom recruits children as young as sixteen and routinely sends 17-year olds into combat. The United States has deployed under-18 groups in the Gulf War, Somalia and the Balkans.  """"The widespread availability of modern lightweight weapons has contributed to the child soldier problem, enabling even the smallest child to become an efficient killer,"""" said Rory Mungoven, Coordinator of the Coalition.  International political and military support for armed forces and armed groups using children, sometimes linked to the exploitation of natural resources like diamonds or oil, has in many cases deepened conflicts and the involvement of children.  """"When even a few children are involved as soldiers in a conflict, all children in that particular community come under suspicion,"""" said Mr. Mungoven. The report's Colombia entry cites the case of a party of schoolchildren that were killed after the army mistook them for a guerrilla unit in Antioquia province.  """"It is not just children in conflict areas who are at risk: often children are recruited from second countries, among refugee communities or ethnic diasporas, or trafficked across borders,"""" said Mr Mungoven.  Children have been recruited from countries in Europe and North America by Kurdish and Kosovar armed groups. Cross-border recruitment in Africa is also common. Since last June, 80 countries have signed a new treaty barring the use of children in armed conflict, but only five have ratified it. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict was adopted by the UN General Assembly on May 25, 2000. It prohibits the participation of children under the age of 18 in hostilities and all forced recruitment of children. It also calls on states to raise the minimum age for military recruitment.  """"In recent years more and more governments have stopped recruiting children under-18 into the military. Even some armed groups have committed themselves to this principle,"""" said Ms. Becker.

These troops are evidently loyal to rebel leader Mbusa Nyamwisi. This was only the latest episode of a string of factional rebel disputes in Congo that over the last two years had left countless civilians dead, and caused untold suffering among survivors.  In an attempt to disarm the mutineers, a senior ALC commander lost his life. Fighting intensified on Wednesday, when another senior ALC commander and his soldiers reportedly switched camps and joined the mutineers. By Sunday, June 10, a tense stand-off prevailed in Beni, with a spokesperson for the FLC telling Human Rights Watch that some thirty mutineers, whom he described as armed bandits, had surrendered, and that operations were underway to round up the others. At the same time, the mutineers circulated a declaration, a copy of which has reached Human Rights Watch, in which they claimed that they had the upper hand, and gave the other ALC troops a 24-hour ultimatum to return to their native Equateur. The Front for the Liberation of Congo is unraveling largely along ethnic and regional lines, notwithstanding claims by both factions that they resorted to fighting in an attempt to end the other camp's abusive behavior against the local population. The Front resulted from the merger, in January 2001, of the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba, which controls much of Equateur province in the north of Congo, and another less-organized rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML), also known as RCD-Kisangani, which claimed to control parts of North Kivu and Orientale provinces in northeastern Congo. At the time of the merger negotiations, the head of the RCD-ML, Wamba dia Wamba, opposed the process and left the region to live in exile. However, several other RCD-ML leaders joined the Front, most prominently Mbusa Nyamwisi, RCD-ML's prime minister, and a native of Beni. Mbusa in turn left to exile in South Africa soon after the merger, reportedly due to his discomfort at the predominance of MLC cadres in the military and civilian command structures of the new Front.  The current fighting pits soldiers from Equateur province, described as Lingala speakers, against local fighters, otherwise known as pro-Mbusa or Swahili Speakers, who remained loyal to Mbusa Nyamwisi, even during his prolonged and continuing absence. The pro-Mbusa forces have reportedly complained about the absence of local representatives in the senior military and civilian echelons of the FLC. Uganda initiated the establishment of the FLC in late 2000 by proposing a merger of all the Congolese rebel groups under its patronage: the MLC, RCD-ML, and the less known RCD-National. Underscoring the urgency of the unification process from the Ugandan perspective, Lt. Col. Noble Mayombo, chief of military intelligence, and considered by many observers as the architect of the merger, declared: """"Uganda wants the rebellion in Congo to merge and to have one territory, one army, one programme, one enemy and to sustain itself economically by organizing the resources it controls."""" (See: Congo rebels agree to merge, New Vision, Kampala, January 16, 2001.) Wamba, the RCD-ML leader who refused to join the new front, insisted at the time that the Congolese partners were not allowed to discuss the merger among themselves, and later complained that the creation of the FLC was """"imposed"""" by Uganda on its Congolese rebel allies.  During the current crisis, the Ugandan army dispatched its acting chief of staff, Brig. James Kazini, on Friday, June 8, to help diffuse the growing tensions within the FLC. Commenting on the visit, the official New Vision on June 9 said that the insecurity in the region has forced the Ugandan soldiers, who were getting ready to pull out of Congo, to redeploy, and added that the Ugandan army had recently reinforced its positions in Beni. The newspaper also reported, without further details, that Ugandan army was forced to join Bemba's troops when the pro-Mbusa militia appeared to be gaining ground.  The ongoing fighting in Beni is reminiscent of the situation that plagued the neighboring town of Bunia throughout the year 2000. The Ugandan army appeared to be supporting both sides of a similar rebel dispute there as partisans of Mbusa Nyamwisi, then prime minister of the RCD-ML, repeatedly attempted to oust Wamba dia Wamba, the chairman of the group, with civilians killed in the crossfire at each attempt.  It was the disintegration of the RCD-ML following these repeated coup attempts that led the Ugandan backers to engineer the creation of the FLC. The merger appears at present to be failing due to rejection by the local RCD-ML cadres of what they perceive as MLC dominance in their region. Here as in Bunia, Uganda had trained both armed groups for rebel strongmen whom it had elected as allies, even when it seemed likely that these groups would be used in local ethnic and partisan conflict rather than as part of a disciplined military force.  Due to the remoteness of the region, and lack of modern means of communications there, little of this situation has come to the attention of the international community. A United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo has no presence in Beni, having deployed military liaison officers and observers to the neighboring town of Bunia, which used to be until late 2000 the headquarters of the RCD-ML. The U.N. peacekeeping mission has yet to deploy liaison officers and observers in Beni, where the chief of the FLC had elected to establish the eastern headquarters of the front.  In mid-2000, fighting between the occupying Rwandan and Ugandan armies and their respective Congolese rebel clients for the control of Congo's third largest city Kisangani, and its rich diamond trade, had led to the deaths of more than 750 Congolese civilians and the injury of thousands. Hundreds of schools, dozens of hospitals and clinics, and infrastructure necessary for the survival of the population were partially or totally damaged in the crossfire. That tragedy took place less than a year after a first round of fighting between the two camps in which 200 Kisangani residents were killed.  As the influence of the FLC comes under increasing challenge in northeastern Congo, not only the town of Beni, but the entire northeastern Congo, including its other urban poles of Butembo and Bunia, appear on the verge of total destabilization.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",""

We are not opposed a priori to China's hosting the games. We are concerned, however, that every previous major international event that China has hosted, from the 1990 East Asian Games to the 1995 International Women's Conference, has been preceded by arrests designed to eliminate any sign of protest or dissent, and evictions of migrants or homeless people whose presence might be considered unsightly. The Chinese government has also sought to restrict access to such events, refusing visas to journalists and to individuals linked in some way to Taiwan, Tibet, or Xinjiang, or to organizations that have taken stands critical of Chinese government policies. If the I.O.C. were to request and secure written commitments on human rights protections now, it would reassure many around the world who are disturbed by China's human rights practices. If the I.O.C. failed to receive such commitments, on the other hand, the desirability of selecting Beijing might well be questioned.  We believe the I.O.C., at a minimum, should seek two specific commitments:  That if Beijing is chosen, the international media covering the Games will have unrestricted access to the country and that there will be no discrimination against journalists or participants based on their political or religious views or country of origin.  That if Beijing is selected, China will allow the IOC to set up a monitoring committee that includes at least one human rights expert to review security plans for the Games and try to ensure that safeguards against human rights violations are built in. Independent monitors should also have regular access to building sites to ensure that migrant workers and other residents of the areas in question are treated in accordance with international human rights standards. We know the I.O.C. does not take political factors into account in making its choice of host city. But protecting human rights is about fairness, dignity, and equality, values that are intrinsic to the Games themselves. To seek assurances from a potential host that no one will suffer because of the Games would seem to be firmly in keeping with the Olympic ideal.

Accountability Prosecuting the perpetrators of crimes against civilians committed by servicemen in Chechnya would be the best indicator that the Russian government is committed to justice, preventing abuses, and enforcing military professionalism and discipline. This, in turn, would foster an environment conducive to eventual reconciliation. But Russian efforts to date provide no such indication. To the best of our knowledge, none of the 293 criminal cases investigated by the civilian procuracy and police has been tried. Of the sixty-five cases handled by the military procuracy, few appear to relate to torture, summary execution, arbitrary detention, and forced disappearances-the main abuses perpetrated in this conflict. Seven have been tried in court, resulting in one active prison sentence (for manslaughter); many others have been either suspended or dismissed, or referred to local law enforcement agencies.  The Russian authorities have offered the high-profile trial of Yuri Budanov-a former colonel and tank commander charged with abducting and murdering an eighteen-year-old Chechen woman-as proof of their commitment to accountability. But Budanov's high-profile trial is an exception. No progress has been made on investigating three massacres perpetrated by Russian forces in 1999 and 2000, which killed at least 130 civilians. At least 150 civilians have """"disappeared"""" after being taken into Russian custody, but not one of the opened investigations has located a single victim or identified a single perpetrator.  The meagerness of these efforts has encouraged continued abuses. The discovery of a mass dumping ground of fifty-one bodies at the end of February 2001 near Russia's main military base in Chechnya is the latest evidence. As Human Rights Watch has reported, of the nineteen bodies identified, sixteen had been extrajudicially executed. Yet autopsies on these bodies were incomplete and important evidence was not collected.  Russia's high-level command has so far escaped scrutiny for any complicity in abuses and for its failure to prevent them. Minister of Defense Sergei Ivanov's recent expression of personal sympathy for Budanov suggests little scrutiny can be expected. It is also instructive to note the treatment of Gen. Vladimir Shamanov, whose forces committed a well-documented massacre of civilians in Alkhan-Yurt in December of 1999. Although relieved from duty in Chechnya soon after the Alkhan-Yurt massacre, Shamanov nonetheless received the Hero of Russia award, and successfully ran for governor of Ulianovsk, reportedly at the Kremlin's bidding.  We applaud your administration's strong support for this year's United Nations Commission on Human Rights resolution on Chechnya, which condemned the slow pace of investigations into these abuses. We ask that you press President Putin for implementation of the resolution, by opening an investigation into the responsibility of General Vladimir Shamanov for the abuses committed in Alkhan-Yurt, and by providing a detailed accounting of investigations and prosecutions of human rights violations, including of the mass dumping site in Chechnya.  Access for international monitors International monitors in the region can help fill the void left by Russia's poor record on accountability. U.N. thematic rapporteurs or representatives on summary executions, forced disappearances, torture, and arbitrary detention should visit Chechnya. Taken together, their authoritative reports constitute the best chance for an official record of some of the worst abuses perpetrated in the conflict. Also, the deployment of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's Assistance Group to Chechnya would provide sustained international monitoring. The U.N. resolution called on Russia to allow both sets of monitors to work in the region.  The Russian government has repeatedly failed to live up to its promise to allow the redeployment of the Assistance Group. In the past, each public commitment-including that made by Foreign Minister Ivanov last month to Secretary of State Powell-was followed by lame excuses and obfuscation. We hope the Russian Foreign Ministry's announcement yesterday that the Assistance Group will be redeployed next week will mean that the monitors are actually on their way to the region by the time you meet with President Putin on Saturday. Meanwhile, Russian authorities have consistently and flatly refused to grant invitations to the U.N. monitors mentioned above. We hope that you will press President Putin to issue invitations to U.N. monitors by July's G-8 summit. You should also signal that the deployment of OSCE monitors is not an end in itself, but a means to secure human rights improvements and progress on accountability.  Beyond the Summit Your administration has rightly stressed that Russia will not be fully accepted by the international community until it respects the rights of its people. But Russia may discount that message unless it is consistently delivered by the United States and its European partners. We hope you will raise the need to speak with one voice on Chechnya when you meet with European leaders on the other stops of your trip. Because Russia will exploit our differences and inconsistencies, we hope your administration will coordinate with the E.U. its benchmarks for progress in Chechnya.  In the long run, your message may also be undermined if Russia feels that its conduct in Chechnya has no practical consequences in its relationships with key partners.  For example, Russia will again share the world stage with the United States at the G-8 summit in July. In order to come to the table as a worthy member of this distinguished group of the world's leading democracies, the Russian government should be urged to take concrete steps toward compliance with the U.N. resolution and the creation of a meaningful accountability process.  The conduct of Russia's military in Chechnya should also raise serious questions for continued military cooperation with the U.S. in such areas as Partnership for Peace and Balkans peacekeeping. The United States must scrutinize the Russian military's lack of discipline and professionalism in the Chechnya campaign, examine the record of specific Russian units with which it may have military contacts, and emphasize the need for accountability in the context of the U.S.-Russia joint military contact program.  Ultimately, the growing military and security cooperation you envision between the United States and Russia requires a frank assessment of whether, in light of its record in Chechnya, the Russian military is indeed a worthy partner. A military that decorates officers whose troops have murdered, raped, and looted surely is not a military with which the United States should carry on business as usual. The nature and degree of U.S. cooperation with the Russian military should depend on progress on these issues.  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you or your staff has any questions regarding our findings or recommendations. Thank you for your attention to these concerns. We wish you a productive summit.

As an international organization committed to the defense of basic human rights, we oppose all executions, including that of McVeigh. But executing McVeigh would also have the unfortunate consequence of ending the de facto moratorium on federal executions, in effect since 1963. The last-minute revelation that the Federal Bureau of Investigation withheld from McVeigh's defense counsel massive quantities of materials-especially in a case as closely scrutinized as this one-underscores the inherent imperfections and fallibility of criminal prosecutions and the unacceptable nature of irreversible punishments.  We recognize the appalling nature of the crime for which McVeigh has been convicted and the horror, anger, and sorrow about the tragic loss of life and injury that his bombing of a federal office building in Oklahoma City caused. What he did cannot be excused. But executions must be rejected as a punishment no matter how heinous the crime.  Recognition that the death penalty violates basic human rights has fueled a growing movement to abolish capital punishment around the world. However, the United States thus far remains wedded to a practice that its democratic allies rightly consider unworthy of modern societies. It is significant to note that the treaty to create an International Criminal Court does not include the death penalty as an option for punishing war criminals, providing another clear indication of the international community's rejection of capital punishment in all cases.  The cornerstone of human rights is respect for the inherent dignity of all human beings and the inviolability of the human person. These principles cannot be squared with the death penalty, a form of punishment that is unique in its barbarity and finality, and, as practiced in the United States, a punishment inevitably plagued by arbitrariness, prejudice and error. The intrinsic fallibility of all criminal justice systems assures that even when full due process of law is respected, innocent persons may be executed.  We urge you to exert human rights leadership with regard to the death penalty and to use your presidential powers to commute McVeigh's death sentence to life imprisonment without parole.

""""For the first time, a Guatemalan court has ruled that army officers cannot get away with murder.""""  A three-judge tribunal found retired army Col. Byron Lima Estrada and his army captain son Byron Lima Oliva guilty of murder and sentenced them each to 30 years in prison.

Bishop Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in April 1998 two days after he released the Catholic Church's report on wartime abuses, titled """"Guatemala: Never Again."""" The report concluded that the Guatemalan military was responsible for the vast majority of the war's 200,000 dead. A 1999 report by a U.N.-sponsored truth commission confirmed the church's findings, finding that the army had engaged in systematic human rights violations, including torture, forced disappearance and acts of genocide.  Until now, no military officer had been successfully prosecuted for human rights abuses in Guatemala. A major obstacle to carrying out prosecutions has been the intimidation of prosecutors, judges and witnesses through terror tactics. In this regard, the Gerardi trial was no exception. One judge, one prosecutor and several witnesses were forced by death threats to flee the country. Grenades exploded in the backyard of another judge two days before the trial began.

""""The anti-Albanian riots in Bitola present a dangerous escalation of the crisis in Macedonia,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The local police must fulfill their responsibility to stop the violence, not exacerbate it.""""  Wednesday's anti-Albanian rioting broke out one day after five policemen, three of them from Bitola, were killed by insurgents of the ethnic Albanian National Liberation Army (NLA) on Tuesday night outside the town of Tetovo, located 150 kilometers north of Bitola. Similar anti-Albanian riots broke out in the city in late April, when eight policemen, including four from Bitola, were killed in an NLA ambush near Tetovo. Bitola, located some 170 kilometers south of Skopje, is Macedonia's third largest city, and ethnic Albanians compromise about 15 percent of its population. There has been no NLA fighting in or near the city of Bitola.  Human Rights Watch visited fourteen ethnic Albanian homes that had been gutted by fire during Wednesday night's riots and received information about other burned homes as well as extensive damage to the Albanian commercial district. The targeted homes appeared to have been carefully selected and included the homes of prominent ethnic Albanian politicians such as the Deputy Health Minister and the wealthiest ethnic Albanians.  A village mosque was also vandalized by the rioters. Grave markers were broken, and several graves had been broken open. The windows of the mosque were broken, and rioters had set the carpets inside the mosque on fire but did not succeed in burning it down. On the exterior wall of the mosque, rioters had painted several swastikas and written """"Death to the Shiptars."""" The term """"Shiptar"""" is an ethnic slur when used by non-Albanians.  The available evidence strongly suggests that the Bitola police did not take any actions to stop the anti-Albanian attacks and that a significant number of Bitola police officers, in and out of uniform, took part in the rioting. The police took no apparent action to enforce the 10 p.m. curfew it had announced for the town, and the rioting continued until after 1 a.m., according to official police statements. The rioting crowds claimed to be revenging the deaths of Bitola police officers that were ambushed near Tetovo.  Some of the witnesses reported that Bitola police officers had taken an active part in the rioting. According to Zini K. (see testimony below), at least one uniformed police officer and one uniformed soldier took part in the destruction and burning of his restaurant. According to Hamdi S., police officers stopped him from attempting to put out the fire to his home, and were shouting """"Burn, burn for Macedonia.""""  Human Rights Watch called on the Macedonian Ministry of Interior to carry out an immediate investigation into the conduct of the Bitola police during the riots and urged the international community to assist and participate in the investigation.  """"The conduct of the Bitola police in yesterday's riots is deeply worrying,"""" said Cartner. """"The Interior Ministry and the international community need to act now to prevent a further deterioration in police discipline.""""  Anti-Albanian sentiment in Bitola is rapidly growing into a campaign by extremists to rid Bitola of its ethnic Albanian population. Witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated that the rioters had yelled slogans including """"Death to Albanians,"""" """"Pure Bitola,"""" """"Albanians Out of Bitola,"""" """"Get Out Albanians,"""" and other such statements. The rioters told some of the ethnic Albanians that they had a week to get out of town before being targeted again. Many ethnic Albanians have fled their homes in Bitola in the aftermath of Wednesday's riot because they are afraid of further attacks.  """"Bitola's ethnic Albanians are scared to death of what could happen next,"""" said Cartner. """"Urgent action is required to protect this vulnerable population from further attacks.""""  The rioting in Bitola started at about 8 p.m. in the Albanian shopping and restaurant district of the town. Sixty-four-year-old Zini K. was in his restaurant when the crowds attacked: """"They entered inside [the restaurant], destroyed the place and put it on fire. Then they went to another one and they burned it as well. I had a motorbike, and they put it inside the restaurant and burned it."""" Zini K. managed to put out the fire, but returned the next day to find his restaurant looted and burned to the ground: """"After I left, they came back to the restaurant and burned it again. It is now completely burned. Everything was looted -- our kitchen tools, tables, dishes, radio, telephone -- there is nothing left.""""  Zini K. then went home to Czar Samuel Street and was again faced with a very large mob shortly after 10 p.m. The mob, after damaging a mosque at the end of the street, proceeded carefully to select Albanian homes on the street and burned them down:  They had burned down my nephew's home and another relative's home. Our steel door was locked. They broke it down and started yelling, """"Where are you Shiptar, Where are you Shiptar."""" I stepped back inside and when they saw me retreat they started throwing flames at the house. They also started burning the store in front. Then they went down a little lower and began burning another house. Hamdi S., aged forty-two, was at home on the same street with his wife and three children when the mob approached:  At around 10:20 p.m., the lights in the houses suddenly went out. Then we heard a very big noise. First we could hear shooting. I said to my wife that they must have started burning the houses. When I went out I saw that my uncle's house was burning. After they burned his house, they came to my house. I took out my children, my eleven-year-old daughter first. At that moment, the first [Molotov] cocktail was thrown and I told my boys and my wife to run away. The crowd started shouting, """"You have one week to leave Bitola, and if you don't go to Albania we will kill you, we will make you disappear from this world."""" They were behaving so brutally. They were mostly from eighteen to fifty years old, no women. There were about 800 to 1,000 people in the street; the whole street from my house to the mosque was filled with people.... They were yelling """"Death to the Albanians, Go to Albania"""" and they were also using dirty curses.  The crowd also beat some ethnic Albanians. Among those beaten was a fifty-year-old former local leader of the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) and his forty-seven-year-old wife. A witness who saw the beating described what he witnessed:  They broke down the fence and entered inside. First five people entered inside. They were breaking the tables inside, ripping up papers and pouring something out of a bottle. One of them set the home alight. A man and woman were on the top floor of the house when it started burning. The two were taken out of the house. They were taken into the basement and then I couldn't see them anymore. After fifteen or twenty minutes, they came back outside. They were covered with blood. The Macedonians were slapping their faces. The beating victims had fled Bitola, but other neighbors confirmed the beatings to Human Rights Watch.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia",""

""""These villagers were clearly not combatants,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The NLA has a responsibility to respect international law, just as much as the Macedonian government does.""""  According to interviews conducted in Macedonia this week by Human Rights Watch, the NLA arbitrarily detained two different groups of Serbian civilians in the mosque of Matejce, a village with a mixed Serbian and Albanian population west of Kumanovo. The village has been the location of ongoing fighting between the NLA and Macedonian forces for much of the past week.  Both Albanian and Serbian witnesses said that all of the villagers of Matejce had decided to try to avoid the fighting between the NLA and Macedonian forces, and ethnic Albanian elders of the village had requested that the NLA stay out of the village. However, following heavy fighting in the nearby villages of Vaksince and Slupcane, NLA fighters entered Matejce around May 24 and attacked the government police station, pulling the village of Matejce into the conflict.  Sixty-year-old Krunislav Filipovic, an ethnic Serb, was taken from his home by NLA fighters on the evening of May 24. He was taken to the village mosque together with three other elderly ethnic Serbs, he told Human Rights Watch. All four were fathers of Macedonian policemen, apparently the reason for their detention. At the village mosque, NLA fighters beat the four men with their fists and gun butts and kicked them. On several occasions, the men were subjected to mock executions, and NLA fighters sharpened knives in front of the men, threatening to behead them. The men were kept in detention, abused for four days, and then released in the village of Otla, where they were told to walk towards Macedonian government positions. NLA soldiers fired above their heads as they fled.  Two of Filipovic's fellow captives remain hospitalized in Kumanovo as of June 8. Police guards at the hospital refused to allow Human Rights Watch researchers access to the men, thereby preventing the researchers from documenting their injuries and providing a more complete description of the incident. Human Rights Watch's investigation was further impeded by the refusal of the Macedonian police to allow access to the Serbian-inhabited village of Umni Dol.  Seventy-eight-year-old Bozidar Trojanovic was also detained at the village mosque by NLA fighters on May 25, together with three other men and three women, most of them elderly. The four men in the group were beaten at the mosque, according to Trojanovic, although the women were not physically abused:  They started kicking our [the men's] legs with their boots. We kept silent; there was nothing we could do. Then they ordered us to stand up and face the wall, and to bend our heads. They kept hitting us on the back of the head. Then they told us to turn around and to turn our faces to one side. They slapped my [male relative] four times on each side. Then they told him to hit his brother just like that.  The second group of ethnic Serbs was detained in a guarded basement with ten other Serbs from Matejce for four days before being released. On May 28, they were released when the ethnic Albanian inhabitants of Matejce left the village.  Human Rights Watch has also looked into a number of other reports of NLA abuse that have appeared in the Macedonian-language press or come from the Macedonian government. To date, Human Rights Watch researchers have not been able to confirm many of these reports, but are continuing to investigate these allegations. Human Rights Watch has also asked the Macedonian authorities for specific details on a number of allegations they have made regarding NLA abuses, but has received no concrete information to date.","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

Preliminary Human Rights Watch research has found both that the attacks have continued, and that law enforcement officials have taken no significant measures to prevent them or hold the perpetrators accountable. In a March 28 letter to President Shevardnadze, Human Rights Watch expressed concern about a pattern of attacks on adherents of non-Orthodox faiths that took place in the month following the February 22 Supreme Court ruling upholding the deregistration of the Jehovah's Witnesses organization. I am attaching the letter for your convenience. Preliminary Human Rights Watch research has found both that the attacks have continued, and that law enforcement officials have taken no significant measures to prevent them or hold the perpetrators accountable. Information that you could provide about the investigation and prosecution of such attacks would yield a better understanding of what has been done to end impunity for them. Human Rights Watch interviewed the victims of five incidents in which vigilantes violently disrupted Jehovah's Witnesses prayer gatherings. In nearly every case, the perpetrators planned the attacks in advance, forcibly entered the private homes in which the prayer gatherings were held, physically assaulted those gathered, and destroyed property; in no case, to our knowledge, did police question the victims with a view to identifying the perpetrators:  • On February 27, at about 3:00 p.m., a group led by Basili Mkhalavishvili broke up a large prayer gathering in a private home in the Isani district of Tbilisi. While police were present at the scene, according to one eyewitness they not only did nothing to deter or stop the attack, but in fact abetted it by forcing open the house gates for the attackers. The attackers beat Rudolph Mikirtumov, a Jehovah's Witness; he sustained multiple injuries to his face, which required his brief hospitalization. Mikirtumov told Human Rights Watch that instead of questioning him about the details of the attack, procuracy investigators said that neighbors had been complaining about the noise level from his home. They also reportedly stated that information about police having forced open the gate for the attackers was """"unnecessary.""""  • On March 5, a group of about 150 people, which included four priests from a local parish, attacked a prayer gathering in the town of Sashkhere; the previous day, the priests reportedly warned Jehovah's Witnesses that the Patriarchate authorized them to break up all Jehovah's Witnesses prayer gatherings. According to Savle Gotsadze, an eyewitness, the attackers broke household items belonging to the Itchkitidze family, who hosted the prayer gathering, and burned religious literature. Gotsadze told Human Rights Watch that a forensic doctor examined him for injuries he sustained during the attack. While the chief of police expressed regret to Gotsadze and Itchkitidze about the incident, to our knowledge, no investigation is under way.  • On April 7, a group of about twenty people- led by Paata Bluashvili, of the Cross organization-broke up a prayer gathering, ransacking the apartment where the gathering was held, and beating those gathered and neighbors who came to their defense. The attackers burned seized religious literature in a bonfire. According to an eyewitness, Ardoteli Kviria, police accused the Jehovah's Witnesses of violating public order by meeting in a private home; according to our information no investigation into the attack is under way.  • In another incident in Rustavi, on April 29, Jehovah's Witnesses began to disperse after hearing threats shouted through the door. Neighbors then beat those who attempted to escape the home through the window and seized their religious literature, which they allegedly burned in the front yard. Ilya Eterishvili, one of those beaten, told Human Rights Watch that while police asked him to write a statement about the attack, no investigation followed.  • In a particularly vicious incident on April 30, a group wielding sticks spiked with nails broke up a prayer gathering in the Svanetisubani district of Tbilisi. The attackers broke windows, furniture and electrical equipment, and beat those gathered with the spiked sticks. As a result, three victims were hospitalized. Among them was Tamaz Nachkebia, who sustained multiple contusions and whose head injuries required five stitches. A Human Rights Watch representative saw the open wounds to Nachkebia's left hand, right arm, left foot, as well as the bruises to his right ribcage and left cheek. While police who arrived at the scene after the attack ended took statements from eyewitnesses, to our knowledge no one has been detained in relation to the assault.

The Optional Protocol is a strong expression of the international consensus against the use of children as soldiers - to date, it has already been signed and/or ratified by 79 governments. As a country that has been directly affected by the use of children in armed conflict, the commitment of your government to end the use of children as soldiers is particularly welcome, and we hope, will set an example for other countries affected by armed conflict.  As you know, the protocol prohibits the forced recruitment or participation of children under age 18 in hostilities, and any recruitment or use of children by non-governmental armed groups. Article 3(2) of the protocol also requires States to make a declaration upon ratification, regarding the age at which national forces will permit voluntary recruitment. We understand from Minister Ntumba Luaba that your government has not yet made such a declaration.  We urge you to deposit a binding declaration as soon as possible establishing a minimum age for voluntary recruitment of at least eighteen. Such a declaration would be in line with the standards set in the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, recommendations by the UN Secretary General, and the general definition of childhood as set forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It will also help contribute to a strong international norm rejecting any recruitment of children under the age of eighteen, whether compulsorily or """"voluntarily.""""  We also urge your government to take immediate steps in accordance with Article 6 (3) of the protocol to demobilize or otherwise release all children currently serving the armed forces of the DRC, and to provide them with appropriate assistance for their physical and psychological recovery.  Various sources estimate that thousands of children are currently serving in the FAC. Many children who fought with the Alliance of Democratic Forces for Liberation (ADFL) during the 1996-97 war continued to serve in the government Congolese Armed Forces (FAC) after the change of regime. Other children have also been recruited or allowed to enlist more recently, and no substantial demobilization of children has taken place, despite a June 9, 2000 decree issued by the late President Laurent Kabila, for the demobilization and reintegration of all vulnerable populations, including child soldiers.  We understand that your government's Ministry of Human Rights, together with UNICEF, is prepared to launch a major awareness raising campaign in the army, to convince commanders to immediately demobilize child soldiers. We would welcome such an initiative, and believe that such demobilization would set a positive example for other parties engaged in conflicts in the region and elsewhere in the world.

The result of work spearheaded by HRW, the indictment represented the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. In March 2001, however, after political interference, Senegal's Court of Final Appeals ruled that Habré could not be tried in Senegal for crimes allegedly committed in Chad. We are now working with Habré's victims to seek his extradition to Belgium where a judge has opened an investigation. The United Nations Committee against Torture, in a rare move, has asked Senegal not to let Habré leave Senegal except via extradition. In the meantime, the case has opened new possibilities for justice in Chad itself, where the victims have filed cases against many of Habré's accomplices who remain in powerful positions.

Denied a childhood and often subjected to horrific violence, some 300,000 children are serving as soldiers in current armed conflicts. These young combatants participate in all aspects of contemporary warfare. They wield AK-47s and M-16s on the front lines of combat, serve as human mine detectors, participate in suicide missions, carry supplies, and act as spies, messengers or lookouts.    Amman Declaration on The Use of Children as Soldiers (April 8-10 2001)    Berlin Declaration on the Use of Children as Soldiers (October 20, 1999)    Montevideo Declaration on the Use of Children as Soldiers (July 8, 1999)   Kathmandu Declaration on the Use of Children as Soldiers (May 18, 2000)    Maputo Declaration on the Use of Children as Soldiers (April 22, 1999)    U.S. Congress, October 1998    European Parliament, December 1998    World Council of Churches, December 1998     Physically vulnerable and easily intimidated, children typically make obedient soldiers. Many are abducted or recruited by force, and often compelled to follow orders under threat of death. Others join armed groups out of desperation. As society breaks down during conflict, leaving children no access to school, driving them from their homes, or separating them from family members, many children perceive armed groups as their best chance for survival. Others seek escape from poverty or join military forces to avenge family members who have been killed. Child soldiers are being used in more than thirty countries around the world. Human Rights Watch has interviewed child soldiers from countries including Angola, Colombia, Lebanon, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Sudan and Uganda. In Sierra Leone, thousands of children abducted by rebel forces witnessed and participated in horrible atrocities against civilians, including beheadings, amputations, rape, and burning people alive. Children forced to take part in atrocities were often given drugs to overcome their fear or reluctance to fight. In Colombia, tens of thousands of children have been used as soldiers by all sides to the country’s ongoing bloody conflict. Government-backed paramilitaries recruit children as young as eight, while guerrilla forces use children to collect intelligence, make and deploy mines, and serve as advance troops in ambush attacks. In southern Lebanon, boys as young as twelve years of age have been subject to forced conscription by the South Lebanon Army (SLA), an Israeli auxiliary militia. When men and boys refuse to serve, flee the region to avoid conscription, or desert the SLA forces, their entire families may be expelled from the occupied zone. Girls are also used as soldiers in many parts of the world. In addition to combat duties, girls are subject to sexual abuse and may be taken as “wives” by rebel leaders in Angola, Sierra Leone and Uganda. In Northern Uganda, Human Rights Watch interviewed girls who had been impregnated by rebel commanders, and then forced to strap their babies on their backs and take up arms against Ugandan security forces. Because of their immaturity and lack of experience, child soldiers suffer higher casualties than their adult counterparts. Even after the conflict is over, they may be left physically disabled or psychologically traumatized. Frequently denied an education or the opportunity to learn civilian job skills, many find it difficult to re-join peaceful society. Schooled only in war, former child soldier are often drawn into crime or become easy prey for future recruitment.","",""

(para. 98, amended indictment) Milosevic's authority: As President of Yugoslavia, Milosevic was Supreme Commander of the Yugoslav Army. (para. 28) Milosevic also exercised extensive de facto control over the Serbian police and other institutions nominally under the jurisdiction of Serbia. (para. 30.) In addition, under the Yugoslav Law on Defense, during a state of war, the Serbian and federal police come under the command of the Yugoslav Army. (para. 29.) A state of war was declared in Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999, which gave Slobodan Milosevic, as supreme commander of the army, both de jure and de facto control of the police. Specific criminal acts:  Murder:  Forces of Yugoslavia and Serbia murdered hundreds of Kosovo Albanians between January 15, 1999 and June 20, 1999. The killings occurred in a widespread or systematic manner. (para. 24.)

(paras. 23 and 99)  Persecution on political, racial and religious grounds: In addition to the murder and deportation, forces of Yugoslavia and Serbia, acting in concert, engaged in a well-planned and coordinated campaign of destruction of property and personal identity documents belonging to Kosovo Albanian civilians. (paras. 20 and 22) Throughout Kosovo, these forces looted and pillaged the personal and commercial property owned by Kosovo Albanians and forced them from their homes. (para. 19) They also harassed, humiliated, and degraded Kosovo Albanian civilians based on the latter's ethnicity and religion. This took the form of physical and verbal abuse, including insults, racial slurs, degrading acts, beatings, and other forms of physical mistreatment based on ethnicity and religion. (para. 21) Criminal Charges (para. 26): Count 1 - crime against humanity (deportation), Art. 5(d) of the Tribunal Statute Count 2 - crime against humanity (murder), Art 5(a) of the Tribunal Statute Count 3 - violation of the laws or customs of war (murder), Art. 3 of the Tribunal Statute; Count 4 - crime against humanity (persecution), Art. 5(h) of the Tribunal Statute All acts and omissions charged as crimes against humanity were part of a widespread or systematic attack.

During those wars, Serb military, paramilitary and police forces forcibly expelled and deported non-Serbs in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina from areas under Serb control. They utilized the same method of operations as those used in Kosovo in 1999: heavy shelling and armed attacks on villages; widespread killings; destruction of non-Serbian residential areas and cultural and religious sites; and forced transfer and deportation of non-Serbian populations.

The police of the Montenegrin Republic remained loyal to the Montenegrin government and were not active in Kosovo. From the time he became president of Serbia in 1989, Slobodan Milosevic gradually strengthened and expanded the Serbian police over the federal police and the Yugoslav Army, both of which he viewed as less loyal forces. Friction between the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army occasionally emerged over the increased resources and prestige provided to the former. Only the Serbian regular police, special police, and possibly state security special forces were active in Kosovo in the first half of 1998. The army, although present in the province, was restricted to maintaining security along the borders with Macedonia and Albania. This changed in April 1998, when the army participated in military actions in southwestern Kosovo along the border with Albania. The army and the police cooperated from that point on, but for the most part, actions against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) remained the responsibility of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs throughout 1998. The primacy of the MUP began to change in late 1998 and early 1999 when President Milosevic reshuffled some key members of the Serbian police and Yugoslav Army, placing known loyalists in top positions. Among other changes, Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic replaced Momcilo Perisic as General Chief of Staff of the Yugoslav Army and Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic was promoted to commander of the VJ's Third Army, which has responsibility for southern Serbia and Kosovo. Radomir Markovic replaced Jovica Stanisic as head of Serbia's security service (secret police). In late March 1999, when faced with attacks by NATO, the police, army, paramilitaries and other irregulars units coordinated their defense against air strikes, attacks on the KLA, and actions against civilians. Serbian state security played a major role in Kosovo throughout the 1990s, monitoring Kosovar Albanian political circles, especially the KLA. State security also had a special operations unit called the JSO (Jedinica za Specijalne Operacije, or Special Operations Unit), known informally as """"Frenki's Boys"""" (after the group's supposed founder Frenki Simatovic), which was active in Kosovo in 1998 and 1999 and earlier in Bosnia and Croatia. Commander of the unit during the Kosovo war was Milorad Lukovic (formerly Milorad Ulemek), also known as """"Legija."""" Serbia's state security was also involved in organizing and arming the various paramilitary groups active in the former Yugoslavia and Kosovo, including Arkan's Tigers and the White Eagles. The composition and command structure of the various paramilitary forces and the precise connections they each had to the Serbian and Yugoslav governments remains unclear. But the evidence reveals that they operated in Kosovo with the approval and ongoing political and logistical support of the government, and often in close coordination with regular forces. Unlike in Bosnia, Serbian paramilitaries fighting in Kosovo were largely integrated into more formal police and army structures. Chain of Command The chain of command for the Yugoslav Army is transparent. As set out in the attached diagram, local commanders in Kosovo reported to the commanders of the Pristina Corps, led by Maj. Gen. Vladimir Lazarevic. The Pristina Corps reported to the Third Army, commanded by Col. Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, who reported to the General Staff, commanded by Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic. The supreme commander of the VJ was Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who chaired the Supreme Defense Council. The structure of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs is more complicated due to the profusion of units and groups within the MUP. Although these groups were clearly coordinated by the Serbian government firmly under the control of Milosevic, their precise relationship to the government and interior ministry remains unclear. The same is true for the paramilitary forces active in Kosovo, most of whom fought within the official structures of the army or police. According to the Serbian and Yugoslav constitutions, Yugoslav President Milosevic did not have de jure authority over the Serbian police in a time of peace. Milosevic, however, exercised extensive de facto control over the police and other institutions nominally under the competence of Serbia. In addition, under the Yugoslav Law on Defense, during a state of war, the Serbian and federal police come under the command of the Yugoslav Army. A state of war was declared in Yugoslavia on March 24, 1999, which gave Slobodan Milosevic, as supreme commander of the army, both de jure and de facto control of the police. The MUP's de jure structure as presented in the diagram does not necessarily reflect the de facto reality. Various lines of command and control within and between state security, public security, the paramilitary forces, and the president are still unknown. Various individuals of lesser rank sometimes played more important roles than their formal superiors. Lastly, the methods and structure of cooperation between the MUP and VJ remain unclear, including a possible coordination center in Pristina. Despite this, some individuals in the ministry during the war were clearly in positions of authority over forces in Kosovo. These include Col. Gen. Radomir Markovic, head of the state security service, and his deputy for Kosovo, David Gajic; Col. Gen. Vlastimir Djordjevic, head of the public security service; Col. Gen. Obrad Stevanovic, head of Serbia's police department, and his deputy for Kosovo, Col. Sreten Lukic (currently Serbia's Assistant Minister of Internal Affairs); Col. Zivko Trajkovic, commander of the Anti-terrorist Forces (SAJ); and Milorad Lukovic, commander of the state security service's Special Operations Unit (JSO). Command Responsibility The case against the Serbian and Yugoslav leadership is convincing. According to Article 7 of the tribunal's statute, the direct perpetrator of a crime, as well as the military or political leaders who ordered that crime, can be prosecuted. Paragraph three adds that a superior is accountable for crimes committed if he or she knew or had reason to know about such acts and failed to take steps to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators. The extent and systematic nature of the crimes in Kosovo make it highly implausible that the Serbian and Yugoslav leadership did not know that crimes were being committed. Numerous statements by the Serbian and Yugoslav government or military demonstrate that the top leadership was regularly apprised of the security situation in Kosovo. Well-distributed reports by the media and nongovernmental organizations repeatedly documented abuses by Serbian and Yugoslav forces. Despite this, there is no evidence to suggest attempts by the Milosevic government to hinder government or paramilitary operations, despite repeated and credible reports that they had committed atrocities. Rather than being held accountable, hundreds of army and police personnel were promoted or given awards after the war, such as such as Order of the National Hero and Order of the Yugoslav Flag, including most of the top military and police leadership. On May 24, 1999, citing war crimes committed in Kosovo, the tribunal indicted Slobodan Milosevic and four other former Serbian or Yugoslav officials who, as of June 30, 2001, remain at large: former Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, former Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, former Serbian Minister of Internal Affairs Vlajko Stojiljkovic, and former Yugoslav Army Chief of Staff General Dragoljub Ojdanic. The Kosovo Liberation Army is also under investigation for war crimes committed against Serbs, Roma, and other non ethnic-Albanians, as well as against Kosovar Albanians considered """"collaborators"""" with the Serbian state. The new Serbian and Yugoslav governments took some initial steps toward accountability after the fall of Milosevic in October 2000. On April 1, 2001, Milosevic was arrested on charges of corruption, although without mention of war crimes or his transfer to the tribunal in The Hague. Under intense pressure from the international community, he was transferred to The Hague on June 28. In May 2001, a Yugoslav Army military court charged 193 VJ soldiers and reservists with criminal offenses against the life and property of the Albanian community in Kosovo, although details of the charges remain unclear. The Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced a similar investigation into abusive police. Command Responsibility in International Law The culpability of superior officers for atrocities that their subordinates commit is commonly known as command responsibility. Although the concept originated in military law, it now also embraces the responsibility of civil authorities for the abuses committed by persons under their direct authority. There are two forms of command responsibility. The first is direct responsibility for orders that are unlawful. When an official authorizes or orders rapes, massacres, deportations or other grave abuses, that individual is criminally responsible for these acts, whether or not the superior who initiated or conveyed the order also carries out the atrocity or has subordinates perform it. The other form of command responsibility is an imputed responsibility for the crimes of subordinates where those crimes are not based on direct orders. In this case, responsibility pivots on whether the superior had notice of the subordinates' atrocities. Notice may be direct, either by the commander witnessing the crimes or being informed of them shortly thereafter. It may also be constructive, where the offenses were so numerous or notorious that a reasonable person could come to no other conclusion than that the officer must have known of their commission or of the existence of an understood and acknowledged routine for their commission. Another formulation of constructive notice is that the officer should have known of the offenses, but displayed such serious personal dereliction as to constitute willful and wanton disregard of the possible consequences--an extreme form of negligence. The failure of the officer to take appropriate measures to control the subordinates under his command and prevent atrocities, and the failure to punish offenders, are further elements in showing command responsibility. An individual found to have command responsibility for a crime committed by a subordinate is deemed culpable to the same degree as the subordinate: that is, if the officer stood by while the subordinate committed murder, the officer is also guilty of murder. With regard to the crime of rape, some courts have been reluctant to impute command responsibility for what is seen as a random and private crime. However, the requirements of command responsibility do not vary according to the particular crime; the commander is no more permitted to stand by while rape is committed than to stand by while murder is committed. Thus, if a superior had reason to know that subordinates under his command committed rape (such as news reports, or widespread commission of this abuse), and failed to use all feasible means under his command to prevent and punish it, he too may be found guilty of rape. Command responsibility is a part of customary international law. In other words, it has become such an accepted feature of international and national criminal law, through usage and inclusion in treaties, that it is now a universally recognized precept. It is also an explicit feature of many treaties, including the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia, which has jurisdiction over any war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide committed with regard to the conflict in Kosovo. Article 7(3) of the Tribunal's statute provides in relevant part: The fact that any of ... [the listed criminal acts] was committed by a subordinate does not relieve his superior of criminal responsibility if he knew or had reason to know that the subordinate was about to commit such acts or had done so and the superior failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to prevent such acts or to punish the perpetrators thereof.  Subordinates, in turn, may not be absolved of responsibility if it is found that their commanders were responsible, through either direct acts or omission, for the atrocities the subordinates committed. The doctrine of superior orders is not a defense to criminal liability; however, it may be used to mitigate the sentence of a subordinate who acted pursuant to the order of a superior (see, for example, Article 7(4) of the Statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia).","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","Crisis and Conflict"

The call by Human Rights Watch came as Prime Minister Sharon begins a visit to the United States. The Israeli leader´s visit here comes as controversy mounts in Europe over his responsibility for the 1982 killings. “There is abundant evidence that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed on a wide scale in the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, but to date, not a single individual has been brought to justice,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “President Bush should urge Prime Minister Sharon to cooperate with any investigation.” As Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon had overall responsibility over the Israeli Defense Forces and allowed Phalangist militias to enter the camps where they terrorized the residents for three days. Human Rights Watch said that the United States had a substantial interest in the case because the Israeli occupation of West Beirut followed written U.S. assurances that Palestinians remaining there would be safe, as part of an arrangement that saw the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization forces. The debate in Europe erupted following a BBC documentary on the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, which was aired in the United Kingdom on June 17. The day after, survivors of the massacre lodged a complaint against Sharon in a Belgian court. During the BBC program, Morris Draper, the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East at the time, said that U.S. officials were horrified when told Sharon had allowed Phalange militias into West Beirut and the camps “because it would be a massacre.” He told the BBC that after the killings began he cabled Defense Minister Sharon, telling him, “You must stop the slaughter…. The situation is absolutely appalling. They are killing children. You have the field completely under your control and are therefore responsible for that area.” The Kahan Commission (named after the President of the Israeli Supreme Court) that investigated the massacre in 1983 concluded that “Minister of Defense [Sharon] bears personal responsibility” and should “draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office.” The commission recommended that Prime Minister Menachem Begin remove Sharon from office if he did not resign. Sharon did resign as minister of defense, though he subsequently assumed other cabinet positions. Annexes of the commission report have not yet been made public, and it is not known if they contain additional information specific to Sharon´s involvement. Human Rights Watch said that the findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, could not substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that would bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. Human Rights Watch recognizes that Sharon, in his capacity as Prime Minister, may invoke temporary immunity; however, that should not preclude an active criminal investigation into his conduct whether in Israel, or elsewhere. “Criminal investigations and prosecutions must include militia leaders like Elie Hobeika in Lebanon who carried out these atrocities,” Megally said. “But the Israeli government also has a responsibility to conduct an investigation into the actions of its own high officials who knew – and, in any case, certainly should have known -- that atrocities were likely to occur and did not act promptly to stop them once they knew the killing had started.” Background Details of the massacre: The massacre at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps occurred between September 16 and 18, 1982, after Israel Defense Forces (“IDF”) then occupying Beirut and under Ariel Sharon´s overall command as Israeli Defense Minister permitted members of the Phalange militia into the camps. The precise civilian death toll most likely will never be known. Israeli military intelligence estimated that between 700 and 800 people were killed in Sabra and Shatilla during the sixty-two-hour rampage, while Palestinian and other sources have claimed that the dead numbered up to several thousand. The victims included infants, children, women (including pregnant women), and the elderly, some of whom were mutilated or disemboweled before or after they were killed. Journalists who arrived on the scene immediately after the massacre also saw evidence of the summary execution of young men. To cite only one contemporaneous account, that of Thomas Friedman of the New York Times: “[M]ostly I saw groups of young men in their twenties and thirties who had been lined up against walls, tied by their hands and feet, and then mowed down gangland-style with fusillades of machine-gun fire.” By all accounts, the perpetrators of this indiscriminate slaughter were members of the Phalange (or Kata´eb, in Arabic) militia, a Lebanese force that was armed by and closely allied to Israel since the outbreak of Lebanon´s civil war in 1975. It must be noted, however, that the killings were carried out in an area under IDF control. An IDF forward command post was situated on the roof of a multi-story building located some 200 meters southwest of the Shatilla camp. Findings of the Kahan Commission: In February 1983, the three-member Israeli official independent commission of inquiry charged with investigating the events known as the Kahan Commission named former Defense Minister Sharon as one of the individuals who """"bears personal responsibility"""" for the Sabra and Shatilla massacre. Former Defense Minister Sharon´s decision to allow the Phalange into the camps: The Kahan Commission report detailed the direct role of former Defense Minister Sharon in allowing the Phalangists into the Sabra and Shatilla camps. For instance, then-Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Rafael Eitan testified that the entry of the Phalangists into the refugee camps was agreed upon between former Defense Minister Sharon and himself. Thereafter, former Defense Minister Sharon went to Phalangist headquarters and met with, among others, a number of Phalangist commanders. A document issued by former Defense Minister Sharon´s office containing “The Defense Minister´s Summary of 15 September 1982” states: “For the operation in the camps the Phalangists should be sent in.” That document also stated that “the I.D.F. shall command the forces in the area.” Former Defense Minister Sharon´s disregard of the consequences of that decision: As to former Defense Minister Sharon´s testimony that “no one had imagined the Phalangists would carry out a massacre in the camps,” the Kahan Commission concluded that “it is impossible to justify [Sharon´s] disregard of the danger of a massacre” because “no prophetic powers were required to know that a concrete danger of acts of slaughter existed when the Phalangists were moved into the camps without the I.D.F.´s being with them.” In fact, the Commission found: “In our view, everyone who had anything to do with events in Lebanon should have felt apprehension about a massacre in the camps, if armed Phalangist forces were to be moved into them without the I.D.F. exercising concrete and effective supervision and scrutiny of them…. To this backdrop of the Phalangists´ [enmity] toward the Palestinians [in the camps] were added the profound shock [of Bashir Jemayel´s recent death]….” The Kahan Commission further found that: If in fact the Defense Minister, when he decided that the Phalangists would enter the camps without the I.D.F. taking part in the operation, did not think that that decision could bring about the very disaster that in fact occurred, the only possible explanation for this is that he disregarded any apprehensions about what was to be expected because the advantages . . . to be gained from the Phalangists´ entry into the camps distracted him from the proper consideration in this instance. The Commission explained that “if the decision were taken with the awareness that the risk of harm to the inhabitants existed, the obligation existed to adopt measures which would ensure effective and ongoing supervision by the I.D.F. over the actions of the Phalangists at the site, in such a manner as to prevent the danger or at least reduce it considerably. The Defense Minister issued no order regarding the adoption of such measures.” The Commission concluded: “In our view, the Minister of Defense made a grave mistake when he ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population in the refugee camps.” As its ultimate recommendation, the Kahan Commission recommended that Sharon be discharged from serving as Minister of Defense, and that, if necessary, the then-Prime Minister should consider removing him from office. * * * Human Rights Watch takes the position that what happened at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, and that all those responsible need to be brought to justice. Enough questions are raised by the Kahan Commission report to warrant a criminal investigation by Israel into whether former Defense Minister Sharon and other Israeli military officials—including some who knew the massacre was occurring but took no actions to stop it—bear criminal responsibility. The findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, cannot substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that will bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. The Lebanese government should institute a similar investigation into the Sabra and Shatilla massacre.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/30/macedonian-police-abuses-documented","Macedonian Police Abuses Documented","Macedonian Police Abuses Documented","Ethnic Albanian Men Separated, Tortured at Police Stations","05/30/2001","Macedonian forces are systematically separating out ethnic Albanian males fleeing fierce fighting in northern Macedonia, and severely beating some of the men at police stations, Human Rights Watch said today. In the most severe cases documented by Human Rights Watch, the ill-treatment appears intended to extract confessions or information about the National Liberation Army (NLA) and amounts to torture. The fear of violence at the hands of the Macedonian police is also stopping many ethnic Albanians from fleeing to safety into government-controlled territory. """"Ethnic Albanian men fleeing the fighting in Macedonia face severe ill-treatment by the police,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"We have documented serious beatings and torture of ethnic Albanians at the Kumanovo and Skopje police stations in the last week. The victims we interviewed have the bruises and injuries to back up their claims of abuse.""""  On May 22, Macedonian forces launched an offensive against ethnic Albanian fighters of the NLA who had seized control of villages located in the vicinity of the northern Macedonian town of Kumanovo. An estimated fifteen thousand civilians remain in the NLA-controlled territory, sparking concerns of significant civilian casualties if the fighting continues. Since the beginning of the renewed offensive, Macedonian forces have separated out men from the civilians fleeing the fighting and have severely beaten some of them.  Human Rights Watch researchers have documented cases of severe beating at the Kumanovo police station, located in the region where the latest fighting is taking place, as well as at the Skopje police station, located in the capital city of Macedonia. Some of the tactics involved hundreds of blows to the soles of the victims' feet-a torture technique known as falanga which causes severe pain and swelling and can lead to kidney failure-as well as extended beatings on the hands, buttocks, arms, and heads of the victims. The men interviewed by Human Rights Watch indicated that they had heard the screams of many other beating victims at the police stations, suggesting that the scope of such abuse may be widespread and condoned at the police stations.  Human Rights Watch said that the ill-treatment violates international human rights law, and in the most severe cases amounts to torture.  Many of the ethnic Albanians are reluctant to talk to international observers because they fear further retaliation from the Macedonian police, and have in some cases been warned by their abusers not to discuss their maltreatment. For this reason, identifying details are withheld from the testimonies summarized below. Some of the men were forced to sign confessions under torture and to implicate others in NLA-related activities. Large numbers of men continue to be separated out from convoys of fleeing civilians and taken to police stations.  On Tuesday, May 29, Human Rights Watch researchers observed a group of approximately thirty-five ethnic Albanian men from the village of Matejce who were separated from their female relatives and taken into the police station at Kumanovo.  """"Jevit Hasani,"""" (not his real name), a seventeen-year-old villager from Vaksince, an NLA-controlled village recaptured by government forces over the weekend, was arrested and taken to the Skopje police station after fleeing fighting in the village. He described the treatment he experienced in the police station:  They took us in a corridor. Suddenly I was hit on the head with a wooden stick, and then ten or so people began beating me until I fainted. When I came to, I was in a room. They were swearing, insulting my mother and sister, calling me an NLA fighter, a terrorist nationalist. … I was lying on the ground on my side, facing the wall when I woke up, and my shoes were off. They started beating me on the feet and the buttocks. At the beginning they would just beat me. They would count ten hits as one, and went all until fifty or sixty [i.e. five hundred to six hundred hits]. This was before they asked me questions. [After being questioned and beaten more], they wrote a confession. Then they made me read the confession in front of a camera in another room. I had to confess I was a spy, and they made me read a list of names of people in the NLA which they had prepared, and say that the NLA had refused to let the civilians go out and abused us.  """"Jevit Hasani"""" was released after forty-eight hours in custody. He showed Human Rights Watch researchers the deep bruises and hematoma on his buttocks caused by the severe beatings, and explained he had continued to suffer the after effects of beatings to his private parts. According to """"Jevit Hasani"""" many other people were undergoing beatings while he was being detained at the police station: """"I heard other people screaming while I was being interrogated, in other rooms. They were screaming in pain, there were a lot of them."""" A second witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch offered an essentially similar account of his beating at the Skopje police station, and also had deep bruises and hematoma on his buttocks and swollen hands, but did not want his ordeal publicized out of fear of police retaliation.  """"Ymer Aqifi,"""" (not his real name) a fifty-one-year-old father of six from Slupcane, was beaten at the Kumanovo police station on Sunday, May 27. He described the beatings he and eight other men he was detained with sustained:  We were taken into a corridor. Four [police investigators] made me lie down flat on my stomach. They beat me with an iron bar on the wrists, a wooden stick on my head, a [police] baton on my buttocks, and kicked with their feet however much they wanted. They were swearing, insulting my mother and sisters, all kinds of curses. They were asking who is NLA, where the Imam [religious leader] of the village was, where the civilian defenses were, where the headquarters were. But no one wrote down anything, they didn't wait for answers. That lasted for about an hour… I lost consciousness. Then they poured water on me. Two policemen came when I regained consciousness and they took me and the others to another corridor. … Down there, all night long, there were screaming people beneath us. You could hear how they beat them.  """"Ymer Aqifi"""" showed Human Rights Watch researchers the deep bruises and hematoma on his buttocks, deep bruises on his arms, bruises on his forehead and the sides of his head, and his swollen hands. Twenty-five-year-old """"Adem Yimeri"""" (not his real name), a farmer from Vaksince, was also beaten at Kumanovo police station. He described the beating to Human Rights Watch:  They took us to offices and there were three [police investigators]. They took me to an office by myself. … He said to write down who is in the NLA. They asked me about my relatives in Kosovo. … A person entered with a wooden stick covered with tape and he hit me on the back. Then they hit me on the sides of the head [above the hairline] so the bruises wouldn't show. They hit me twice on the hands with the bat. Then they said, """"If it doesn't hurt like that, put them on the table and we will make sure you never pick up a rifle again."""" Then they hit me ten more times on the hands. Then they made me bend over a chair. One of them would hit me in the kidneys, and another hit me on the head. They said they would destroy my kidneys so I could never work again. From 12 to 4 p.m., they beat me like that.  """"Ethnic Albanian men remaining in the villages under NLA control fear ill-treatment and torture at the hands of Macedonian forces,"""" commented Cartner. """"There is little doubt that this fear is one of the reasons why so many ethnic Albanian men are refusing to leave their homes in the conflict zone."""" Police forces have also abused ethnic Albanian civilians this past week during raids against suspected NLA sympathizers in Tetovo, the scene of earlier fighting between the NLA and government forces. Human Rights Watch researchers documented the cases of ten ethnic Albanian men who were beaten during police raids in the villages of Dzepciste and Poroj on May 25. During the raid on the Dzepciste home of Naser Junizi, a schoolteacher and village leader accused by the Macedonian government of assisting the NLA, police commandos beat Naser Junizi, two of his brothers, his sixty-eight-year-old father, and his eighteen-year-old son. Police also entered the Poroj compound of the Saiti family, kicking and breaking three ribs of thirty-six-year-old Rami Saiti and attacking his seventy-three-year-old father and seventeen-year-old cousin before apparently realizing they had entered the wrong home and rapidly leaving.  Human Rights Watch noted that police abuse of ethnic Albanians, as well as of Macedonian Slavs who run afoul of the police, is endemic in Macedonia, as documented in two earlier Human Rights Watch reports issued in 1996 and 1998. The NLA has claimed that one of the main reasons for its armed rebellion is the failure of the Macedonian government to address police abuse as well as other forms of discrimination against ethnic Albanians.  Although the Macedonian police appear responsible for the majority of beating cases, Macedonian military forces have also been implicated in beatings. Macedonian military troops appear responsible for the beating of a family of seven in the village of Runica, in which many houses were reportedly burned down by Macedonian troops on May 21, 2001. Human Rights Watch called for an immediate end to torture and other ill-treatment at police stations and urged the international community closely to monitor the treatment of ethnic Albanians by the Macedonian forces.  """"The international community must do its part to bring an end to police abuse of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia,"""" said Cartner. """"International support for the Macedonian government should not mean remaining silent in the face of such severe ill-treatment.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Macedonia","Children's Rights"

The 203-page report is based on in-depth interviews with 140 youth and 130 teachers, administrators, counselors, and parents in seven states: California, Georgia, Kansas, Massachusetts, New York, Texas, and Utah.  The report, Hatred in the Hallways: Discrimination and Violence Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Students in U.S. Public Schools, found that teachers and administrators frequently ignore bullying and even violence against these students. School officials often refuse to accept reports of harassment or to hold the perpetrators accountable; in some instances, they have encouraged or have themselves participated in such abuse.  """"The U.S. school system gets a failing grade when it comes to providing a safe place for gay students to get an education,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch and a coauthor of the report. """"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender kids face a greater risk of bullying than any other students in American high schools. That has to stop.""""  Students told Human Rights Watch that they spend an enormous amount of energy figuring out how to get to and from school safely, avoiding the hallways when other students are present in order to escape slurs and shoves, and cutting gym classes to escape being beaten up-in short, attempting to become invisible. One student told Human Rights Watch that attending school meant being in """"survival mode.""""  The harassment takes a serious toll on these students' emotional and physical health and on their academic studies. Some drop out of school. Others commit suicide. A growing number are demanding that school administrations ensure their safety and that they be allowed to organize gay-straight student groups.  Every state requires youth to attend school. Yet only a handful of states have enacted legislation to protect students from harassment and violence based on sexual orientation or gender identity. This leaves the vast majority of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students vulnerable to abuse.  """"School systems and teachers are really failing these kids,"""" said Widney Brown, advocacy director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch and a coauthor of the report. """"And the consequence is that they are not getting an education.""""  Human Rights Watch called for immediate action by school districts, the states, and the federal government to end these abuses:  All school district policies should explicitly prohibit harassment and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. School districts should also ensure that these policies are implemented fully; where gaps exist between policy and practice, they should take immediate measures to close the gap by training all staff and students.  State legislatures should enact laws to protect students from harassment and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.  The U.S. Department of Education should monitor school districts for compliance with the principle of nondiscrimination, intervene where policies are failing, and include sexual orientation and gender identity in data collection tools measuring discrimination in education.  Federal and state government should enact legislation to protect administrators, teachers, counselors, other school staff, and all employees from discrimination in employment on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.","United States","Children's Rights, LGBT Rights, Women's Rights, Education"

The report, """"Reluctant Recruits: Children and Adults Forcibly Recruited for Military Service in North Kivu,"""" details recruitment efforts since late 2000 by the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma (RCD-Goma) and the Rwandan army troops who support it. RCD-Goma has repeatedly pledged to demobilize its child soldiers, but has not fulfilled these promises, the report says.     """"Children are being abducted and sent to battle by the very soldiers who are supposed to protect them,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Adviser to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"RCD-Goma must live up to its agreements to end this terrible practice.""""     As part of the 1999 Lusaka Accords, RCD-Goma agreed to halt the use of children as soldiers. In May 2000, RCD-Goma said it would create a commission to supervise demobilization of child soldiers, but a year later the commission is not functioning effectively. In April 2001, authorities of the rebel movement promised to deliver several hundred children in training at military camps to representatives of the United Nations. But several days later, they reportedly allowed some 1800 new recruits between the ages of 12 and 17 to graduate from training at one of these camps. Each child soldier received a new uniform and firearm.     In the early months of the recruitment campaign, RCD-Goma soldiers and their Rwandan allies simply abducted children and young men who were sent for military training and later service in the rebel forces. Recruiters picked up children on their way to school or church and took adults en route to work or the market. In some cases, they raided homes, taking away anyone who might be made into a soldier. In some communities parents refused to send their children to school for fear of their being kidnapped. In others, families slept outdoors to avoid raids on their houses or organized to create an uproar when military raiders arrived in the community so that children and young men might escape. As the use of child soldiers attracted increasingly critical comment from international observers, RCD-Goma moved recruiting efforts further from urban centers, making it harder to document their activities. They are also increasingly using promises of rewards to enroll poor and hungry children who lacked other sources of support.     The RCD-Goma military forces pressure local civilian authorities to deliver new recruits. To ensure their cooperation with this and other efforts, RCD-Goma and their Rwandan backers in February 2001 transported more than 400 Congolese officials and traditional chiefs to Rwanda for five weeks of ideological and paramilitary training at a Rwandan military camp. """"According to observers on the spot, trucks are still rolling through Goma, transporting children to military camps in the Congo and even to Rwanda for training,"""" said Des Forges.

Six members of one family were wounded by mortar fire and one man was killed. Seven others civilians were severely beaten. """"Our investigations show that Macedonian forces burned civilians' homes and beat some villagers last week in the village of Runica,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"These crimes must be impartially investigated, and those responsible brought to account.""""  Human Rights Watch located and interviewed witnesses from Runica, a mountain hamlet with approximately 100 inhabitants near Kumanovo, who had been displaced inside Macedonia or fled to Kosovo. Interviewed separately, they provided highly consistent accounts of the attack on the village.  The government's attack began without warning around 4:00 a.m. on May 21 with mortars, tank shells, and helicopter fire, all of the villagers said. Most of the approximately ten families that lived in the hamlet fled immediately into the mountains to escape the shelling.  About 150 meters from their home, the Hyseni family was struck by what is believed to have been a mortar. Six members of the family were wounded, as well as another villager, Mexhit Hamide, aged thirty-one and father of three. He died four days later from his injuries.  Villagers carried three of the wounded through the mountains for ten hours to the border with Kosovo. Three men then returned to retrieve the other three wounded they had left behind. When they arrived back at Runica, they testified, virtually the entire village of approximately fifty houses had been burned to the ground, including the mosque and the school, which had been constructed with help from the humanitarian organization Caritas.  One family with four daughters did not flee the village during the May 21 attack because they could not evacuate their elderly and infirm father. When Macedonian government ground forces entered the village, the family was caught and badly beaten. Macedonian forces beat all members of the family, and twice doused the thirty-one year old son with gasoline and threatened to set him on fire. The family was walked down the only street of the village and continuously beaten and kicked while the Macedonian forces burned most of the houses in the village with gasoline. The men and women of the family showed Human Rights Watch researchers the deep bruises they had obtained from the beatings, and the bloody clothes they had worn that day.  Fifty-six year old Advie Hamidi, the mother of the family, testified to Human Rights Watch:  [The Macedonian forces] broke down the door and right away started beating us, kicking us with their feet and with the butts of their guns.?I don't know how many times I was hit, with fists, with guns, they dragged us by the hair and dragged us.?Then they put gasoline on the house and lit it on fire.?Then they took us out in the street.?They burned all the houses, the mosque and the school.?When we reached the bottom of the village, they put the barrel of an automatic rifle in my husband's mouth. He was lying down and they stepped on his chest, almost killing him. Then they took my eldest son. They twisted his arms [behind his back] almost breaking them?Then they hit him in the head with a rifle and a lot of blood started flowing. Then they took the can of gasoline [and poured it on him]. Me and all my daughters rushed to him to try and protect him.?From the morning hours until 11:30 a.m., they never stopped beating us. All of the villagers, interviewed separately, vehemently claimed that the Albanian insurgency-the National Liberation Army (NLA)-had never been present in the village, although this could not be confirmed by Human Rights Watch. Other villages in the region, such as Slupcane and Vaksince, had an NLA presence.  Human Rights Watch called on the Macedonian government to open an official and impartial investigation into the incident. The European Union, U.S. government, and OSCE, should encourage and participate in this inquiry.  """"The government's actions are at odds with its legal obligations and stated intent to minimize civilian casualties,"""" added Ms. Cartner.

""""To have a truly meaningful dialogue, all opposition leaders should be free to express their views and ideas.""""  Saunders noted that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in April demanded the release of all political prisoners in Burma. He urged Japan and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to insist that Burma take concrete steps to improve basic human rights before it rewarded Rangoon with economic assistance for beginning a dialogue.  In elections on May 27, 1990, opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) won over 80 percent of the 485 seats at stake, and many smaller parties, some representing ethnic minorities, also won seats. Military authorities intervened, however, and none of those elected was ever seated. Some of the parliamentarians have been held since 1990, but most were arrested in subsequent crackdowns on the political opposition.  Others fled and went into exile or were pressured to resign from their political parties. At least four are believed to have died in detention.  Since October 2000, Burma's ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has held a number of meetings with opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and has released more than one hundred political prisoners as a """"confidence-building measure."""" None of the parliamentarians has been released, however, and at least 1,000 other political prisoners remain in detention, including students, members of ethnic minority groups, political party members, journalists, and lawyers.  Hard data on political prisoners is difficult to come by in Burma. The SPDC often does not provide basic information on prisoners, including what offenses they are charged with, the time and place of trials, and where they are detained or imprisoned.  Human Rights Watch's list of eighty-five MPs currently in prison or detention includes their place of detention and the charges and sentences imposed on those convicted of offenses. Human Rights Watch believes that all of the MPs are being detained for peaceful expression of their political views.  Of the eighty-five, forty-five have already been sentenced, most on charges of attempting to """"undermine state security"""" under article 5j of Burma's Emergency Provisions Act. The sentences range from two years to thirty-seven, with most facing seven years or more in prison. Of the forty-five, thirty-eight are members of the NLD, three are from the Mon National Democratic Front, and one each are from the Arakan League for Democracy and the National Democratic Party for Human Rights. The parliamentarians sentenced most recently are Naing Naing, an NLD MP from Rangoon, sentenced to twenty-one years on December 14, 2000, and Min Shwe, an NLD Irrawaddy Division MP, sentenced to three years in March 2001.  The remaining forty parliamentarians being detained have not yet been tried or sentenced. With the exception of one Party for National Democracy MP, all are members of the NLD. Most of those being held without charge were first detained after participating in opposition efforts in September 1998 to form a parallel parliament, which they called the Committee Representing People's Parliament (CRPP), and most are being held in """"guest houses"""" at various military bases, allowed to visit their homes only on weekends.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)",""

On May 15, the Mai-Mai abducted 26 persons, including a Kenyan, Swede and twenty-four Thai nationals, at the compound of DARA-Forest, a Thai-Ugandan logging company, near the town of Mangina. Negotiations for release of the hostages broke down when the Mai-Mai insisted on the pullback of soldiers from the occupying Ugandan army and from the local Ugandan ally, the Front for the Liberation of Congo (FLC).  """"All sides must show restraint so as to avoid endangering the lives of the hostages and jeopardizing the security of the local population,"""" said Suliman Baldo, Senior Researcher for the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, who recently completed a mission to the area. """"Unfortunately, the international community is not giving this matter the attention it deserves."""" The Mai-Mai are demanding that representatives of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Congo (MONUC) and of one or more embassies in the region observe the negotiations. Among the nations whose representatives would make acceptable observers, the Mai-Mai named the United States, France, Belgium, Sudan, Libya, Zimbabwe, and Angola. Zimbabwe and Angola are allied with the government of Congo, now at war with Uganda and the FLC. In the past the Ugandan forces and their local allies have tried to win over Mai-Mai into their ranks, but in other cases they have fought against them. Human Rights Watch documented extra-judicial executions of wounded Mai-Mai combatants by Ugandan soldiers in August 2000 and reprisal killings of civilians thought to support the Mai-Mai by Ugandan soldiers and Congolese rebels in late 2000. These incidents took place in the same region where the hostages are currently held.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",""

Human Rights Watch urged countries with diplomatic or informal relations with the Taliban to advise its leaders against issuing and enforcing such an edict. """"The decision is further evidence of the ascendancy of hardliners within the Taliban,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"And it will leave the Hindu minority vulnerable to harassment and intimidation. In effect, Afghan Hindus are being forced to wear a badge of second-class citizenship.""""  Although a formal edict does not yet appear to have been issued, reports carried on May 23, 2001 by the Taliban's Radio Shariat and Bakhtar news agency said that a decision requiring Hindus to wear distinctive clothing had been made by the Kabul-based Council of the Ulema. Taliban representatives have said that the measure is intended to protect Hindus from being stopped by the religious police belonging to the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice.  Human Rights Watch said requiring Afghan Hindus to wear distinguishing marks is likely instead to have a stigmatizing effect and does not have an apparent protective function. Afghans who expect to have dealings with officials already carry identification cards issued by the Interior Ministry that indicate their religion. Moreover, the identity of local Hindus is well-known in the communities where they live.  There have been credible reports of arbitrary arrests and extortion of other ethnic and religious minorities in Taliban-held areas of Afghanistan, and the new decision aimed at Afghan Hindus raises concern that they may be vulnerable to similar treatment. The Taliban's move to publicly identify Hindus is also likely to hasten their exodus from Afghanistan. The Hindu population has already been reduced by at least one-half through emigration in recent years.  The planned restrictions on Afghan Hindus appear to reflect the increasing strength of hardline elements in the Taliban movement. The death from cancer of Mullah Mohammad Rabbani earlier this year removed an important moderating influence within the Taliban leadership, and there have been reports the Taliban's main consultative bodies, or shuras, are no longer functioning. The narrowing of the Taliban's power structure to a hardline circle is also believed to underly recent measures that have restricted the provision of humanitarian aid.  Last week, police from the Ministry for the Prevention of Vice and Promotion of Virtue raided an Italian-funded emergency hospital in Kabul, beating several staff members and forcing the hospital to suspend operations because male and female staff allegedly mixed in the dining area and operating wards. Taliban authorities have also recently blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid to large parts of the Hazarajat region, which is populated mainly by Shi'a Muslims and includes centers of armed opposition activity.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

Two are accused of spying, although no evidence has been produced to justify the charges. They may all be victims of internal Chinese politics, or pawns in a game Beijing is playing to test the new administration of President George W. Bush. Nevertheless, the detentions have sent a shock wave through the international academic community, causing many researchers worry about the risks of working in China. And frustration in the U.S. Congress is building at a time of growing tensions between Beijing and Washington. President Bush should immediately send a personal representative to Beijing to discuss the plight of the detained intellectuals, their legal status and humanitarian needs. Currently, there is no American ambassador in Beijing. Former President Bill Clinton's ambassador, Joseph Prueher, has returned home, and his replacement has yet to be confirmed. Other urgent cases should also be on the agenda, including that of Liu Yaping, a businessman and permanent U.S. resident detained in Inner Mongolia, whose Chinese lawyers say is extremely ill. Mr. Bush has publicly appealed for """"fair treatment"""" and due process for the detainees, but thus far China seems to feel no obligation to listen. Beijing is gloating over two recent diplomatic victories. Last month, the Chinese delegation mustered support among the 53 members of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights to quash a U.S.-sponsored resolution critical of China's human rights performance. Once again, China escaped censure. Then on May 8 the U.S. lost its seat on the commission, giving Beijing even more reason to brag. The official Chinese state-run media blasted U.S. """"arrogance"""" and bullying. Loss of its seat in Geneva, the media said, was due to America's """"long-biased condemnation of other countries using the camouflage of human rights."""" Looking tough in a tug of war with Washington helps boost the image of Chinese President Jiang Zemin and the current leadership while it is engaged in a succession struggle. Meanwhile, the detention of the four scholars has put the White House in a bind. Li Shaomin, an American citizen educated at Princeton University and professor of business at City University in Hong Kong, was charged with spying May 15. Also accused of spying is Gao Zhan, a permanent U.S. resident and researcher at American University in Washington, D.C. The others being held, inexplicably and without charge, are Wu Jianmin, a U.S. citizen, and Qin Guangguang, a permanent resident. They have all been denied access to lawyers and family members. This kind of treatment is hardly unusual in a system in which what passes for law is arbitrarily applied, where there are no precise definitions of """"spying"""" and """"state secrets,"""" and no independent judiciary. The U.S. State Department has warned that Chinese security officials may be deliberately targeting Chinese-American citizens or residents, especially those who have criticized Beijing or visited Taiwan. Perhaps China intends to interrogate then release the four just in time for the July 13 decision on Beijing's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2008. Equally possible is that they could face secret trials and prison terms, with few prospects for release any time soon. But the U.S. does have some leverage. The president's envoy should make it clear that these detentions could spoil the atmosphere for Mr. Bush's attendance at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Shanghai in October. The administration also should indicate that Mr. Bush will be unable to accept an invitation for a state visit to China unless Beijing clarifies the alleged wrongful acts committed by the four intellectuals and releases those held solely for the exercise of their rights of belief, free expression and association. Mr. Bush should also insist on broader progress on human rights and religious freedom prior to any state visit. The U.S. Congress can help. A new Congressional-Executive Commission is being formed to deal with human rights in China, as mandated by the law on permanent normal trade relations adopted last year. The chair of the commission is Sen. Chuck Hagel, a strong supporter of trade with China. Mr. Hagel and other key members of Congress should send a clear message to Jiang Zemin that resolving these cases and taking other significant steps to improve human rights are essential for building a positive relationship with the United States. China's leaders can't afford to let relations with the U.S. -- an important source of trade and investment -- spiral out of control. It is in China's own long-term interest to limit the damage already done by these detentions.

Torricelli , Mitch McConnell , Charles Schumer and Sam Brownback","05/22/2001","Human Rights Watch wrote letters to US Senator Robert G. Torricelli, Mitch McConnel, Charles Schumer and Sam Brownback in wchich HRW commend their sponsorship of federal legislation to support improvements in voting procedures.HRW is concerned that the legislation as currently proposed ignores the greatest flaw in the nation's electoral process: the disenfranchisement of at least 1.4 million ex-felons. This serious infringement of the right to vote is documented in the enclosed report published in 1998 by Human Rights Watch and The Sentencing Project, """"Losing the Vote: The Impact of Felony Disenfranchisement laws in the United States."""" Unreliable voting machines, burdensome registration procedures, confusing ballots: none of these are as much of an assault on the nation's commitment to democracy than the laws in the thirteen states that prohibit men and women convicted of crimes from voting in state or federal elections even after they have served their sentences and have rejoined society. They may be hard working, tax paying, law-abiding people, but they remain cast out of the national body politic. As one ex-felon noted, """"without a vote, I am a ghost inhabiting a citizen's space."""" The electoral impact of the disenfranchisement of ex-felons is significant. Indeed, in Florida the outcome of the presidential election was affected more by the disenfranchisement laws than by hanging chads and baffling butterfly ballots: more than 400,000 ex-offenders in Florida were denied the vote. No other democratic country in the world denies as many people - in absolute or proportionate terms - the right to vote because of prior felony convictions. The extent of disenfranchisement is even more disturbing given that the right to vote can be lost for relatively minor offenses such as shoplifting. In the states that disenfranchise ex-felons, an eighteen-year-old first-time offender who receives probation upon conviction for a single sale of drugs faces a lifetime of disenfranchisement. The racial impact of disenfranchisement laws is particularly troubling. In seven states, at least one in four black men is disenfranchised as an ex-felon. In Florida and Alabama, the number soars to one in three. Given current rates of incarceration, 40 percent of the next generation of African American men is likely to be permanently disenfranchised. Disenfranchisement laws are a vestige of medieval times when offenders were banished from the community and suffered """"civil death."""" Brought from Europe to the colonies, they gained new political salience at the end of the nineteenth century when disgruntled whites in many Southern states adopted them and other ostensibly race-neutral voting restrictions in an effort to exclude blacks from the vote. State laws that govern voting in federal as well as state elections form of national """"crazy-quilt."""" The right to vote in federal elections is thus subject to the arbitrary accidents of geography. A person convicted of theft in New Jersey, for example, automatically regains the right to vote after release from prison, while a person convicted of the same crime in New Mexico is denied the vote forever unless a pardon can be secured from the state governor. The disenfranchisement of ex-felons serves no discernible legitimate purpose. To the contrary, it arbitrarily denies ex-offenders the ability to vote regardless of the nature of their crimes or the severity of their sentences. It distorts the country's electoral process and diminishes the black vote, countering decades of voting rights gains. We urge you to include within any federal aid to states to modernize their voting systems a condition that no such aid can be granted to states that retain the most damaging electoral anachronism of all - the denial of the franchise to ex-offenders.","United States",""

Powell's stop in Mali. The U.S. was instrumental in galvanizing the U.N. Security Council to support a special court for Sierra Leone, but the process has slowed considerably in recent months. The U.N. Secretary-General has set a deadline of May 23 for interested states to contribute to the U.N. fund for the court. Sec. Powell's visit comes at a critical moment for the U.S. to make a strong and public commitment to the special court.   The United States is training and equipping seven West African battalions for peacekeeping duty in Sierra Leone, including five battalions from Nigeria. Given that the Nigerian military has been responsible for serious abuses in Sierra Leone in January 1999, as well as atrocities in Nigeria itself, any U.S. training must be accompanied by vetting of participating troops, effective training in international humanitarian and human rights law, and monitoring of their behavior in the field. The U.S. should call on President Olusegun Obasanjo to carry out thorough and credible investigations and prosecutions for human rights abuses by the Nigerian armed forces in Nigeria as well as in Sierra Leone. Similar concerns apply to the Guinean military, which is being considered for inclusion in the U.S. """"train-and-equip"""" program and has already received limited military assistance. The Guinean military has been responsible for recent abuses in Sierra Leone, including indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas.   Tens of thousands of Liberian and Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea have been victims of violence by various state security forces and rebel groups in what is essentially a regional war in West Africa. The U.S. should provide greater financial and logistical support for the protection of refugees in Guinea by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees and the Guinean government to deal with the current crisis.  South Africa   South Africa has an important role to play in response to the current crisis in Zimbabwe. South African President Thabo Mbeki has reportedly made behind-the-scenes representations to President Robert Mugabe, but he has not openly condemned the Zimbabwean government's mobilization of arbitrary violence against commercial farmers and farmworkers and critics of government policy. Sec. Powell should urge South Africa to play a more active role in resolving the Zimbabwe crisis, to speak out against the government's deliberate undermining of the rule of law and to mobilize other countries in the region to do the same.  Kenya   The government of President Daniel arap Moi continues to undermine the rule of law. Despite years of promises, President Moi has yet to begin the process of constitutional reform, although he agreed this month to let civil society groups participate. Sec. Powell should publicly recognize the importance of constitutional reform and the need for it to proceed without interference from the executive.  Sudan   While in Kenya, Sec. Powell will also focus on the crisis in Sudan. The government of Sudan remains a gross human rights abuser; rebel groups also commit human rights abuses. In the eighteen-year civil war, the government has recently stepped up its brutal expulsions of southern villagers from oil production areas and trumpeted its resolve to use the oil income for creating a domestic arms industry.   The United States has begun a high-level review of its policy toward Sudan, which should make human rights conditions its centerpiece. The Sudan government should allow complete access for U.N. and humanitarian groups to rebel areas and the Nuba mountains, and end all flight bans. It should also cooperate with the U.N. special rapporteur for human rights in Sudan, providing him full access to the country. The abduction and slavery of women and children, a practice conducted almost entirely by the government-backed militia of the Baggara tribe in western Sudan and by the Sudan army, must stop, and those responsible prosecuted.   Factional fighting among rebel forces in the southern Sudan could widen into a devastating famine unless the U.S. intervenes diplomatically with rebel forces and others. Sec. Powell should try to use U.S. leverage with both the Dinka and Nuer communities to head off what could become a bloody border war.  Uganda   Uganda's presidential election in March 2001 was marked by arrests, harassment and violence against opposition supporters. New legislation is now being discussed that would restrict the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Uganda - another attempt by President Yoweri Museveni to muzzle his critics. Sec. Powell should criticize that attempt, and clearly enunciate U.S. support for freedom of expression and assembly. He should also indicate that the US government will closely follow the campaign for the upcoming parliamentary elections and condemn any arrests, harassment or other attacks on parliamentary candidates and their supporters.  Ugandan-Occupied Areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo   Although some Ugandan military forces are withdrawing from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), these troops have played a decisive - and sometimes brutal - role in local affairs in the areas they have occupied. In the northeastern DRC, Ugandan troops have intentionally exacerbated local ethnic disputes in order to enhance their own control. In the last two years, as many as 7,000 people have been killed in what began as a small-scale dispute over land between Hema and Lendu peoples. At least 150,000 people have been displaced from their homes. The assistance of Ugandan soldiers as well as the provision of training and arms to local forces resulted in a larger number of civilian casualties in these conflicts than would otherwise have been the case. All parties to the conflict, including the Ugandans, have recruited and trained children to serve as soldiers. A recent U.N. report has also documented Uganda's role in the illicit exploitation of Congo's natural resources.   Secretary Powell should publicly call for Uganda to investigate these reports of war crimes committed by its troops in the Congo. The United States should be supporting calls for an international investigation into war crimes against humanity by all parties to the war in Congo.","Africa, United States, Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Sudan, Uganda, US Foreign Policy","International Justice, Free Speech"

The Supreme State Security Court sentenced Saad Eddin Ibrahim, Director of the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Development Studies in Cairo, and 27 co-defendants to between one and seven year prison terms. Charges included accepting foreign funds without authorization, disseminating false information harmful to Egypt's interest and embezzlement.  """"We believe that the charges against Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim were politically motivated. This trial falls in the context of a number of blows intended to muzzle civil society in Egypt,"""" said the organizations in the joint statement.  Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim and his co-defendants have been tried before a court that """"fails to meet international standards of fair trial,"""" the international organizations said today.  Contrary to international standards for fair trial, defendants facing trial before such a court do not have the right to appeal against the verdict before a higher court on the substance of their case. Any challenge to the verdict before the Court of Cassation can only be based on procedural grounds.  The speed with which the verdict was reached raises grave concerns about how seriously the defense team's evidence - some of which was still being submitted today - was considered.  """"We fear that the decision to convict had already been made prior to the conclusion of the trial,"""" said the organizations.  Further concerns arose during the pre-trial and trial proceedings, including interrogation of witnesses without the presence of a lawyer. Among them was Nadia 'Abd al-Nur who was interrogated for more than two weeks following her arrest without her lawyer present. After the trial began, defense lawyers were only given a short time - a matter of hours - to examine the numerous trial documents.  Background  Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim and the other defendants, the majority of them being staff members of two non-governmental organizations (NGOs) - the Ibn Khaldoun Center for Development Studies and the Egyptian Women Voters' Support Center - have been tried on a variety of charges. According to the indictment these include receiving unauthorized funding, forgery and bribery stemming from their work to promote voter participation and election monitoring in connection with national parliamentary elections that were conducted in October and November 2000.  Over the course of June and July 2000, activists of the two NGOs, including Dr. Saad Eddin Ibrahim, were arrested and detained for days or weeks without being formally charged. By the end of August 2000 all detainees had been released from custody. The trial against the 28 men and women began on 18 November 2000 and was attended by a number of foreign and Egyptian journalists and foreign observers, including an Amnesty International delegation.

Seventy people have been expelled in the last ten days alone. """"These forced returns violate the cardinal rule of international refugee law - the principle of non-refoulement,"""" said Rachael Reilly, Refugee Policy Director for Human Rights Watch. """"Governments must not send people fleeing persecution back to countries where their lives and liberty could be at risk."""" Reilly said the whereabouts and current condition of the detainees were unknown.  Human Rights Watch called on the Cambodian government to launch an immediate investigation into the forced deportations, which were carried out by provincial authorities and which represented a breach in commitments made by Cambodia's Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, and the Director General of the National Police. All three had declared that Vietnamese asylum seekers fleeing to Cambodia would not be deported. At a minimum, the deportations show that policies publicly announced in Phnom Penh are not being implemented in the provinces.  Human Rights Watch also urged the Vietnamese government to immediately clarify the whereabouts and conditions of the eighty-nine people who were forcibly returned from Cambodia, and said they should be given immediate access to diplomatic representatives, international organizations, and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It said there are real fears for their safety because the Vietnamese Criminal Code provides for harsh punishment for non-violent political activity deemed to be """"anti-government.""""  The indigenous Vietnamese minorities seeking protection in Cambodia, collectively known as Montagnards, are primarily from the Jarai, Pnong, and Ede (also known as Rhade) ethnic groups that have been targeted in a recent government crackdown in Vietnam. After thousands of indigenous minority people in the Central Highlands demonstrated in February against land confiscations and religious repression, the Vietnamese government sent more troops to the area, barred free access by diplomats and the international media, cut phone lines, and arrested at least twenty people.  Human Rights Watch called for action by the Cambodian government and UNHCR to provide protection to new arrivals in order to avoid further deportation of refugees. The Cambodian government, as a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, has a binding legal obligation to respect the international principle of non-refoulement, which prohibits the forcible return of refugees to situations in which they would be subject to persecution and where their lives and freedom could be threatened.  """"All refugees should have prompt access to UNHCR officials when they arrive in Cambodia in order to determine whether they are in need of international protection,"""" said Reilly. """"And the Vietnamese government should allow UNHCR access to the central highland region to help address the root causes of the refugee flows.""""  Cambodian authorities have forcibly returned at least eighty-nine Vietnamese asylum seekers in recent weeks:  --At 11 a.m. on March 26, the First Deputy Police Commissioner of Mondolkiri province, accompanied by the commander of the provincial Gendarmerie, transported nineteen ethnic Jarai men from Koh Nhek district in Mondolkiri province to the Bou Praing border crossing, where the group was sent back to Vietnam at 5 p.m. on March 27. The third deputy governor of Mondolkiri province signed a document authorizing the transfer, which was also signed by Vietnamese authorities as the """"receivers."""" The Mondolkiri Police Commissioner subsequently issued an official report to Hok Lundy, the Director General of the Cambodian National Police, dated March 29, on the """"transfer and delivery of nineteen Vietnamese illegal immigrants"""" into the hands of the provincial governor, military commander, and police chief of neighboring Dac Lac province in Vietnam.  --On May 8, Y Lim (also known as Dien Y Lien), his wife Maria Nam Linh and their five children--ethnic Pnong asylum seekers who had received official UNHCR protection documents on April 25--were loaded onto a truck in Mondolkiri by Cambodian police and sent back to Vietnam. On April 26, May 1 and again on May 2, UNHCR met with Mondolkiri provincial authorities to secure assurances that persons seeking asylum would not be deported. The day before the family of seven was deported, Hok Lundy met with U.S. Ambassador Kent Wiedemann and assured him that no deportations would take place.  --On May 15, Cambodian district police in Ratanakiri province accompanied two vehicles carrying fourteen Montagnards from Vietnam--including five women and three children--to the Cambodia-Vietnam border, where they were treated as illegal immigrants lacking documents and returned to Vietnam. Several of the Montagnards wept as they were handcuffed by Vietnamese police and taken away.  --At approximately 11:30 p.m. on May 15, the Ratanakiri provincial police commissioner accompanied three vehicles carrying forty-nine Jarai (forty-eight men and one woman) to the Cambodia-Vietnam border, where they were subsequently sent back to Vietnam.  The most recent deportations, on May 15 and 16, were put in motion the same day that UNHCR Regional Representative Jahanshah Assadi was meeting with top Cambodian police official Hok Lundy. At a meeting on May 15, Hok Lundy assured Assadi that Vietnamese asylum seekers would be protected. That very day, Cambodian police officials in Ratanakiri transported sixty-three ethnic Jarai in two groups to the Vietnam border, where they were subsequently deported.  Ratanakiri provincial officials, upon being contacted by U.N. personnel and human rights workers, indicated they were aware of the deportations but stated that the responsibility lay with the immigration police. The Ratanakiri provincial police commissioner told rights workers that in facilitating the deportations, he was carrying out an order received several years ago from the Director General of the National Police and the Ministry of Interior instructing police to deport any individuals who enter the country illegally.  Other Vietnamese asylum-seekers may still be at risk. On May 11, after the deportation of the family of seven Pnong described above, UNHCR staff escorted approximately 150 ethnic minority asylum seekers (thirty families) from several hiding places in the forest in Mondolkiri to an encampment in the provincial capital of Sen Monorum. Upon arrival, provincial officials stated that UNHCR would only have access to the asylum seekers for forty-eight hours, at which time Cambodian immigration laws would take effect, putting the asylum seekers at risk of deportation.  Following the transfer of the asylum seekers to Sen Monorum there was considerable Cambodian police presence around the refugee encampment, with provincial authorities making several attempts to arrest some of the asylum seekers, despite the fact that all had been issued letters documenting the fact that they were """"persons of concern"""" to UNHCR. After extensive negotiations between UNHCR and provincial authorities, the police presence around the camp decreased and the forty-eight hour deadline passed without further incident.","Asia, Cambodia, Vietnam","Refugees and Migrants, Asylum Seekers, Religious Freedom, Migrants"

On December 9, the eve of International Human Rights Day, they had attempted to stage a peaceful sit-in near the gates of parliament in downtown Rabat to demand that those responsible for torture and """"disappearances"""" in Morocco be brought to justice.  Police broke up the gathering just as it got under way, pushing and beating the demonstrators as they hustled them into police wagons and placed them under arrest. Forty-two men and women spent the night in detention and thirty-six were later charged with staging an unauthorized gathering. Three journalists were also arrested and released the same day, after materials were confiscated from them.  """"It was distressing enough to see our colleagues getting beaten up and hauled away for a peaceful sit-in that did not obstruct the flow of traffic,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division. """"Sentencing them to prison confirms that civil liberties are in a precarious state in Morocco despite the many pledges made by King Mohamed VI.""""  AMDH contended that it had informed the authorities well in advance of their intention to hold the gathering. They got no response until just before it was to take place, when the Rabat Municipality issued a written order forbidding the event on unspecified grounds of public order. Human Rights Watch considers this ban a violation of the right of peaceful assembly, a right guaranteed by article 21 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Morocco has ratified.  The December 9 sit-in followed a series of actions by human rights organizations to demand an end to impunity for abuses, particularly the """"disappearances,"""" arbitrary imprisonments, and acts of torture committed during the reign of the late King Hassan II. On December 4, the AMDH addressed an open letter to parliament asking for the creation of a commission of inquiry to examine responsibility for past abuses. The letter named several individuals the AMDH considered implicated in grave abuses, including current officials and a member of parliament.","Middle East/North Africa, Morocco/Western Sahara",""

On May 18, the Federal High Court in Addis Ababa returned to custody for further detention Prof. Mesfin Woldemariam, the founder and first chairman of Ethiopia's Human Rights Council (EHRCO), and Dr. Berhanu Nega, an academic and human rights activist. The two were arrested on May 8, 2001 on claims that they instigated student protests that took place in Addis Ababa University in mid-April. Both men were also denied bail during a first court appearance on May 8, and neither has been formally charged so far.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/18/letter-us-secretary-state-colin-powell-ahead-his-trip-africa","Letter to US Secretary of State Colin Powell Ahead of His Trip to Africa","Letter to US Secretary of State Colin Powell Ahead of His Trip to Africa","","05/18/2001","Dear Mr. Secretary:   Human Rights Watch welcomes your forthcoming trip to Africa, and the focus that such a high-level visit will provide to the many pressing issues on the continent. Since the beginning of this administration, you have underscored the ongoing U.S. commitment to Africa, which has sent an important signal that the U.S. intends to remain engaged there. There are many challenges confronting U.S. policy in Africa, from curbing the flow of illicit weapons and resources to preventing genocide and crimes against humanity. In developing strategies to address these crises, we urge you to ensure that human rights concerns are effectively integrated into U.S. policy. The costs of ignoring human rights and accountability in Africa can be seen in terms of ongoing cycles of violence against civilians, huge refugee flows, destabilization of neighboring countries and economic devastation.   While in Africa and upon your return, we also urge you to speak out publicly about the crucial human rights issues. Targeted use of public diplomacy is an essential component of condemning human rights abuses by governments and rebel groups that has often been under-utilized by U.S. officials.   In preparation for your trip, we would like to raise a number of key issues that should be raised at each of your stops.   Mali - Sierra Leone Crisis   The stopover in Mali provides a platform to publicly raise issues relating to the crisis in Sierra Leone. As you are well aware, the conflict in Sierra Leone has been characterized by systematic atrocities against civilians. Accordingly, we are particularly concerned about the need to proceed swiftly to establish the Special Court for Sierra Leone as a means toward ending impunity and ensuring respect for the rule of law. The U.S. was instrumental in galvanizing the U.N. Security Council to support the court, but the process has slowed considerably in recent months and your direct engagement is required. Given that May 23 is the deadline set by the Secretary General for interested states to contribute to the U.N. trust fund, it is a critical moment for the U.S. to make a strong and public commitment to the court, reaffirming that there can be no impunity for perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity by any side to this conflict. While we understand your concerns relating to the budget assessment issued by the U.N. secretariat, we believe that the solution is for the U.S. to work actively with other donors to resolve the outstanding financial questions and move ahead with the establishment of an effective and efficient court. U.S. leadership on this issue is essential and would serve to encourage other member states to assist in financing the court.   Another area that requires attention involves U.S. training and equipping of seven West African (five Nigerian) battalions for peacekeeping duty in Sierra Leone. It is vital that the participating troops are thoroughly vetted, in accordance with the Leahy amendment which prohibits U.S. military assistance to units believed to be responsible for serious human rights abuses; and that the program includes effective training in international humanitarian and human rights law for all troops, an essential precondition to their deployment in such a difficult environment. Given that the Nigerian military has been responsible for serious abuses in Sierra Leone in January 1999, as well as atrocities in Nigeria itself, it is especially important that any U.S. training be accompanied by monitoring of their behavior in the field and efforts to ensure that any troops responsible for abuses will be held accountable. We therefore urge you to call on President Olusegun Obasanjo to carry out thorough and credible investigations and prosecutions for human rights abuses by the Nigerian armed forces in Nigeria as well as in Sierra Leone. Similar concerns apply to the Guinean military, which is being considered for inclusion in the U.S. train and equip program and has already received limited military assistance. The Guinean military has been responsible for recent abuses in Sierra Leone, including indiscriminate attacks on civilian areas, which means that any increased U.S. military engagement must be carefully evaluated, based on an investigation into allegations of abuses by the Guinean armed forces, with mechanisms for monitoring and accountability ensured.   The regionalization of the conflict in Sierra Leone is a cause of great concern, highlighted by the ongoing arms flows into the country, incursions into neighboring territory by rebel and government forces, and the attacks against refugees in Guinea. In the past year, hundreds of thousands of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees in Guinea have fallen victim to violence by various state security forces and rebel groups at the border area. Many have been trapped in fighting at the border area for months without humanitarian assistance. Other refugees have been subjected to anti-refugee violence and harassment at the hands of Guineans who blame the refugees for the destabilization. Protection issues appear to have fallen far behind humanitarian assistance as a priority for UNHCR and most of its implementing partners. It is imperative that the U.S. provide greater financial assistance to UNHCR and the Guinean government to deal with the current refugee crisis, and that the U.S. play a strong role to ensure the protection of refugees in Guinea.   Mali is the current chair of the Economic Community of West Africa States (ECOWAS), which has been deeply involved in the conflicts in the subregion. While we recognize their efforts to facilitate peace in the region, we are nonetheless concerned that human rights issues are not high enough on their agenda. For example, in April l999 ECOWAS committed itself to conduct an investigation into serious abuses perpetrated by West African peacekeeping (ECOMOG) troops in Freetown during the January l999 rebel offensive. This investigation has yet to take place. In addition, two ECOWAS brokered ceasefire agreements between the government of Sierra Leone and Revolutionary United Front rebels, signed in Abuja in November 2000 and May 2001, lacked adequate focus on protection of civilians. We urge you to encourage ECOWAS to follow up on their commitments and make human rights concerns more central to their agenda.   South Africa   South Africa is a key country for the stability of the southern African region, and in particular has an important role to play in the international community's response to the current crisis in Zimbabwe. While President Mbeki has reportedly made behind-the-scenes representations to President Mugabe, he has not openly condemned the Zimbabwean government's mobilization of the so-called war veterans to visit arbitrary violence on those in the commercial farming sector (farmworkers and farm owners) and those criticizing government policy, including opposition activists. The US should urge South Africa to play a more active role in resolving the Zimbabwe crisis, to speak out against the government's deliberate undermining of the rule of law and to mobilize other SADC countries to do the same.   Kenya    Democratization is an ongoing area of concern in Kenya, and the government of President Daniel arap Moi continues to undermine prospects for the rule of law. Power remains concentrated in the presidency, there are insufficient checks on the executive branch, and there is a lack of accountability for government officials responsible for human rights abuses and corruption. The government continues to ban rallies by a pro-democracy coalition of opposition and civil society organizations called Muungano wa Mageuzi (Peoples Movement for Change).   Constitutional reform is a critical starting point towards genuine democratization in Kenya. Despite repeated promises by President Moi for years, the constitutional reform process remains unresolved. In May 2001, President Moi finally agreed to include broad-based civil society groups in the process. The recently passed law will create a twenty-seven-member Constitution Review Commission, with both parliamentary and civil society representatives, that will embark on the process of consulting Kenyans about the government they want. While this recent development is a good starting point, we urge the U.S. to pay continued attention to ensure that the new constitutional commission is able to complete its work without executive interference. We hope that you will speak out publicly to let Kenyans know that you consider that the outcome of this issue, which promises to grow in urgency with the national election's approach by 2002, to be a critical juncture in Kenya's history.   Sudan    While in Kenya, you will undoubtedly be focusing attention on Sudan. The government of Sudan remains a gross human rights abuser. Rebel groups also commit human rights abuses. In the eighteen-year civil war, the government has stepped up its brutal expulsions of southern villagers from oil production areas and trumpeted its resolve to use the oil income for creating a domestic arms industry, from bullets to tanks. Under the leadership of President (Lt. Gen.) Omar El Bashir, the government has intensified its bombing of civilian targets in the war, denied relief food to needy civilians, killed captured combatants, and abused children's rights, particularly through its military and logistical support for the Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), which holds an estimated 6,000 Ugandan children captive on government-controlled Sudanese territory. The government also arms and supports southern militias, which are responsible for serious abuses. As for the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A), the principal armed movement, its forces continued to loot food (including relief provisions) from the population, sometimes with civilian casualties, and kill captured combatants. On both sides, impunity is the rule.   Before the U.S. considers any heightened engagement with the Sudan government, you should call on the government to take clear and concrete steps toward improving its human rights record, including: allowing complete access for the U.N. and humanitarian NGOs to rebel areas throughout the south, east, and the Nuba mountains; ceasing its flight bans throughout the war-affected areas; cooperating with the U.N. Human Rights Commission's mechanisms, including the special rapporteur for human rights in Sudan, and provide him full access to the country; and prosecuting those involved in the abduction, forced labor and slavery of women and children, a practice conducted almost entirely by government-backed and armed militia of the Baggara tribe in western Sudan and by Sudan army troops, and directed mostly at the population of Bahr El Ghazal.   With regard to southern Sudan, the factional fighting could widen into a devastating famine unless the U.S. intervenes diplomatically with rebel forces and others. We urge you to use U.S. leverage with both the Dinka and Nuer communities to head off what could become a bloody border war. Despite the complexity of the situation in southern Sudan, early and skillful U.S. diplomatic intervention could make a significant difference in sparing the lives of tens of thousands of civilians. The Nuer-Nuer fighting, a war within a war, for now overshadows the civil war in ferocity of fighting and cost in civilian lives. But it is also very integral to the civil war, in which the government has successfully used divide and conquer strategies to open up oil fields for foreign investors and aggravate ethnic tensions in the south.   Uganda    In the wake of Uganda's flawed presidential election in March, we have been concerned about arrests, harassment and violence against opposition supporters, and about numerous irregularities in the electoral process. In April, President Museveni refused to sign the Political Organizations Bill which was adopted by Parliament in February 2001, insisting that an even limited opening of the political system is out of the question. New legislation is being discussed that would restrict the work of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The proposed legislation enables the government to refuse to register an NGO if its objectives are """"in contravention of any government policy or plan, or public interest"""". Not only does the proposed legislation give the government almost unlimited powers to interfere with NGOs, it also criminalizes NGO work by making NGOs and individuals liable to fines or imprisonment if they operate without authorization.   We urge you to use your visit to Uganda to press for freedom of expression and assembly and for the proposed laws restricting the freedom of NGOs to be changed accordingly. The US government should follow the campaign for the upcoming parliamentary elections closely and make clear that arrests, harassment or other attacks on parliamentary candidates and supporters will be condemned.   Ugandan-Occupied Areas in the Democratic Republic of Congo   Of particular concern is Uganda's role in the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Ugandan military forces have played a decisive role in local affairs in the areas under their occupation. Within the context of the broader war and the continuing political conflicts, a small-scale dispute over land between Hema and Lendu peoples in northeastern DRC has grown in scale and intensity. The Hema were thought to enjoy general support from the Ugandans, attributed to a supposed ethnic bond between the Hema of the DRC and those of Uganda. From the first violence in June 1999 through early 2000, an estimated 7,000 persons were killed and another 150,000 were displaced. In the most recent incident of violence in January 2001, another 400 people were killed during one day of violence in Bunia and at least 30,000 people were forced to flee the region. The assistance of Ugandan soldiers as well as the provision of training and arms to local forces resulted in a larger number of civilian casualties in these conflicts than would otherwise have been the case. All parties to the conflict, including the Ugandans, recruited and trained children to serve as soldiers. A recent U.N. report documented Uganda's role in the illicit exploitation of Congo's natural resources.   Uganda has long benefited from substantial U.S. support, not just because of its success in promoting economic development, but also because it offered assistance in curbing the power of Sudan. Throughout the crisis in the Congo, the U.S. has relied on """"quiet diplomacy"""" to raise concerns about human rights with the Ugandan government. Although U.S. officials maintain that they have criticized Ugandan conduct in the DRC, including in meetings with President Museveni, they have shunned any negative comment that might embarrass the Ugandan government. In so doing, they have missed numerous opportunities to underline concerns about human rights abuses and to insist on accountability for them. We urge you to use your visit to Uganda to raise these concerns about human rights, the reported involved of Ugandan soldiers in war crimes in Congo, and Uganda's role in the resource exploitation. Your public posture on these issues could contribute to changing the perception of U.S. bias in the region.   We thank you for your attention to these important issues.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/17/rampant-human-rights-abuses-and-occupation-drc-foreign-armies","Rampant Human Rights Abuses and Occupation of the DRC by Foreign Armies","Rampant Human Rights Abuses and Occupation of the DRC by Foreign Armies","Suliman Ali Baldo Testimony at the House Committee on International Relations","05/17/2001","(Washington, DC) - Thank you, Madam Chair, for the invitation to testify at this hearing on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). My name is Suliman Baldo, and I am a senior researcher at the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. This morning I will be commenting on the human rights abuses committed by the warring parties and the ensuing humanitarian crisis in the DRC. Human Rights Watch is deeply concerned about the continuing carnage and waste that the war has unleashed on the population of the DR Congo. From our own coverage of the humanitarian and human rights costs of local conflicts spawned by the larger war, we find tragically realistic the recent estimates by the International Rescue Committee and other humanitarian agencies that the conflict has caused upward of 2.5 million deaths among the Congolese population, resulting mainly from forced displacement and the resulting lack of food, water, and medical aid.   The link between rampant human rights abuses and the obviously man-made humanitarian disaster is becoming all too familiar, in particular throughout the areas controlled by the foreign occupying armies of Rwandan, Uganda, and Burundi, and the Congolese rebel groups backed by these regional powers. In addition to these forces, other perpetrators in the eastern half of the country include Rwandan and Ugandan insurgents fighting the armies of their respective national governments on Congolese soil. Among the Rwandan insurgents are some who participated in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. In many localities, local rural militia known as Mai-Mai are also committing abuses against the civilian population, although other Mai-Mai groups are protecting their communities. In the disputed territories of Equateur and northern Katanga, government forces (Forces Armées Congolaises, FAC) have also conducted recent reprisal attacks on civilians accused of supporting the rebels.   Whenever any of these forces attack villages, markets, churches, hospitals, or other civilian locations, large numbers of civilians flee their homes and fields. The destruction of their properties and crops renders them totally destitute and undermines their traditional survival strategies and community based support structures. Many heads of households are killed, and many of the young either are forcibly conscripted by the rebels and their backers, or opt to become Mai-Mai fighters to defend their communities against the generalized insecurity. A dearth of outside humanitarian assistance contributes to the aggravation of the crisis. As a result, malnutrition rises; infant mortality skyrockets, and people succumb to curable diseases because they can no longer afford even minimal medical care.   This conflict has spawned serious and widespread human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law throughout the entire region. To achieve lasting peace and security in Central Africa, the administration and the international community must make accountability for these abuses a fundamental tenet of their policy.   The peace process   Parties to the conflict generally ignored the Lusaka ceasefire agreement for more than a year and a half, responding hardly at all to diplomatic initiatives like the three days of discussion at the U.N. Security Council in January 2000 and numerous diplomatic missions to the region. But they finally began to move towards implementation in February 2001, following the death of Laurent Kabila and the installation of his son Joseph Kabila as the Congolese president. All of the major parties began pulling their troops back from their most advanced positions along the frontline of the international war.   Promising though these developments are, it is unlikely that this withdrawal will immediately end the many local conflicts that have been exacerbated by war at the national and international levels. We want to caution against early optimism: troops are disengaging but not withdrawing at present; the Rwandan Patriotic Army reportedly increased its presence in the Kivus; and support by the Kabila government for the Hutu combatants fighting the governments of Rwanda and Burundi has not yet entirely stopped.   Government-controlled territory   Promises of internal reforms   Joseph Kabila has promised new respect for civil liberties and a return to a state based on law but he has yet to initiate any reform of civilian justice. Action on this urgent question should include a review of persons currently detained in prison. President Kabila should order the release of all those held without charges or credible suspicion of guilt. The African Association for the Defense of Human Rights (ASAHDO), one of the leading monitoring groups in the Congo, estimates that at least 200 political prisoners continue to be detained without charge. ASAHDO itself has been harassed by the Congolese government and its security forces. Authorities detained the head of the Association's chapter in Lubumbashi in mid-February, and continue to hold him without charges on suspicion of involvement in the assassination of the late President Kabila. On May 15, agents of the National Intelligence Agency briefly detained the acting chairman and an activist of ASADHO in Lubumbashi and interrogated them overnight about a meeting they had at the Belgian consulate. Indicative of the distance between discourse and realities in the DRC is the fact that ASAHDO's national office in Kinshasa remains closed down following a 1998 government raid, despite informal promises by Joseph Kabila's minister for human rights that the association would be allowed to function openly. The new president has promised improvements in the military justice system. He should begin by abolishing the abusive Court of Military Order, whose rulings cannot be appealed. He should also insist on greater order and transparency in the investigation into the assassination of the elder Kabila. The international commission of inquiry in charge of this investigation, which has representatives from the allied governments of Zimbabwe and Angola in addition to Congolese officials, now detains fifty-eight persons incommunicado, without charges or legal representation. In January President Joseph Kabila established a commission to set terms for the national dialogue with other political forces, as specified in the Lusaka Accords. On March 4 the government and three main rebel groups signed the """"declaration of Lusaka"""" which laid down the general principles for the inter-Congolese dialogue. However, leading opposition parties in Kinshasa continued to boycott the preparatory commission since the current legislation does not recognize the existence of political parties. The political opposition and civil society groups continue their own preparations for the dialogue but are increasingly apprehensive that the government will focus its attention on the participation of the armed opposition and try to marginalize them. Much of the current ethnic tensions in the Congo are rooted in Mobutu Sese Sekou's attempts to strip Congolese of Rwandan ancestry of their right to Congolese citizenship. President Kabila should speak out firmly about the common citizenship and rights of all Congolese, regardless of ethnic group or region of origin.   Rebel Areas   The Congolese Rally for Democracy-Goma in Rwandan occupied areas   The rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy, known as RCD-Goma, controls parts of North Kivu, South Kivu, Maniema, Orientale, and Katanga provinces in the east and southeast. Human Rights Watch holds that these areas should be considered as under the occupation of Rwanda. Parts of South Kivu are also jointly occupied by Burundi. We have received credible reports indicating that Rwandan Patriotic Army troops withdrawn in mid-March from the front lines have not left the country, but were instead redeployed elsewhere in South and North Kivu. They may be intending to try to eliminate Rwandan combatants now known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda. Redeployment may also be meant to permit more intensive exploitation activities in certain mining zones.   As amply documented in Human Rights Watch's reports """"Eastern Congo Ravaged: Killing Civilians and Silencing Protest, May 2000"""" and """"DRC: Casualties of War: Civilians, Rule of Law, and Democratic Freedoms, Feb. 1999,"""" combat between the RPA and its Congolese allies of the RCD-Goma, on the one hand, and Rwandan combatants, on the other, frequently results in indiscriminate attacks on Congolese civilians accused of supporting the other side. Since the beginning of the current war, RPA-RCD-Goma soldiers have committed massacres against civilians in several villages of eastern Congo, including Kasika (19998), Makabola (1999), Katogota (2000), and Lusende (2000). Equally Hutu rebels and Mai-Mai militias have committed grave abuses, including massacres at Shabunda and Sake in 2000. Both parties have used sexual violence against women as a weapon of war to punish and humiliate communities they suspect of supporting their opponents. The RCD-Goma and the RPA continue to forcibly recruit Congolese adults and children, a campaign that has reached alarming rates as of the last quarter of 2000. They have also transferred from Rwanda the system of Local Defense Forces, which enroll local people, many of them children, in counterinsurgency at the village level.   Rwanda has recently launched an effort to assure it a lasting influence in the Kivus, even if it were to withdraw from the Congo. It has sent hundreds of Congolese community leaders, civil service officials, and youth and women activists to training sessions in Rwanda where they undergo intensive indoctrination and limited military training. On March 18, 2001, the top leadership of the RCD-Goma was on hand in Rwanda for the graduation ceremony of some 400 Congolese local leaders who had just finished a two-month session.   The RCD-Goma has a long record of harassing human rights defenders. The activities annually organized by local women rights groups in Bukavu to mark the international women day on 8 March were forbidden this year. Recently, RCD security agents repeatedly interrogated activists of Heritiers de la Justice, a leading monitoring group in South Kivu. In October 2000, RCD-Goma security agents broke up a coordination meeting among several human rights organizations in Bukavu; beat up the participants publicly, and briefly detained them in a military camp. In Goma, agents summoned activists of two other human rights organizations and told them not to speak to Roberto Garreton, the U.N. Special Rapporteur on the DR Congo, during his March visit to the region.   The Front for the Liberation of Congo in Ugandan occupied areas   The Movement for the Liberation of Congo (Mouvement pour la Libération du Congo, MLC), headed by Jean-Pierre Bemba, controls much of Equateur province in the north. By early 2001, it had established its sway over another, less well organized rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie-Mouvement de Libération (RCD-ML), which claimed to control parts of North Kivu, and Orientale provinces in eastern Congo. Uganda engineered this merger among its Congolese rebel allies to unify their military against the government alliance, and to shield it from increasing international scrutiny of its role in manipulating local political divisions and ethnic conflicts as a means of consolidating its control over these resource rich areas.   Uganda reacted angrily to the release in mid April of the report of the U.N. Panel of Experts on the Exploitation of National Resources and other Forms of Wealth of the DR Congo, threatening at one point to withdraw from the Lusaka peace process. Under international prodding, Uganda dropped the threat and committed to withdraw its troops from the country, saying that they have accomplished their mission of defeating the insurgent Allied Democratic Forces (ADF).   Human Rights Watch in March 2001 published the report """"Uganda in Northeastern DRC: Fueling Political and Ethnic Strife"""" which documented the following abuses in areas occupied by Uganda near the border between Uganda and the DRC:   Ugandan military forces have played a decisive role in local affairs, even changing administrative boundaries and designating provincial officials, taking advantage of an administrative void resulting from continuing disputes among the various offshoots of the Ugandan-sponsored RCD-ML.   Within the context of the broader war and the continuing political conflicts, a small-scale dispute over land between Hema and Lendu peoples in northeastern DRC, one of many which previously appeared to have been settled peacefully, grew in scale and intensity. The Hema were thought to enjoy general support from the Ugandans, attributed to a supposed ethnic bond between the Hema of the DRC and those of Uganda. From the first violence in June 1999 through early 2000, an estimated 7,000 persons were killed and another 150,000 were displaced. In the most recent incident of violence in January 2001, another 400 people were killed during one day of violence in Bunia and at least 30,000 people were forced to flee the region.   The perception that the Ugandan army supported the Hema was made real in many communities by Ugandan soldiers who helped Hema in defending their large farms against Lendu attack and who helped Hema militia attack Lendu villages. In some cases, these soldiers provided support in return for payments to themselves or their superior officers. In at least one case, Ugandan soldiers also assisted Lendu in attacking Hema. In one reported clash Ugandan soldiers backing different sides engaged in combat against each other. The assistance of Ugandan soldiers as well as the provision of training and arms to local forces resulted in a larger number of civilian casualties in these conflicts than would otherwise have been the case.   Under the guise of creating an army for the rebel movement, Congolese political leaders developed their own groups of armed supporters, bound to them by ties of personal and/or ethnic loyalty. On several occasions in the last two years, these armed supporters have engaged in operations in which civilians were killed. Uganda trained these groups even when it seemed likely that they would be used in local ethnic and partisan conflict rather than as part of a disciplined military force.   All parties, including the Ugandans, recruited and trained children to serve as soldiers. In August 2000 Uganda transported some 163 children, part of a larger group of 700 recruits, to Uganda for military training. Only in February 2001 did the government of Uganda grant various international agencies access to these children with a view to their demobilization and resettlement.   Contending RCD-ML political leaders Wamba dia Wamba and Mbusa Nyamwisi as well as Uganda People's Defence Force (UPDF) soldiers have illegally detained political leaders whom they have identified as opponents and held them under inhumane conditions. In some cases the UPDF and RCD-ML forces have tortured political opponents in detention.   The RCD-ML's """"prime minister"""" Mbusa Nyamwisi, a local leader from a third powerful ethnic group, the Nande, sought to increase his power base by allying with Mai-Mai forces, groups of local militia who had been fighting largely to expel foreign occupiers of their territory. Originally ready to tolerate this alliance, the Ugandans then rejected it. In subsequent conflicts with the Mai-Mai, Ugandan forces as well as Congolese rebels loyal to Mbusa extrajudicially executed captured Mai-Mai combatants. Subsequently, the UPDF attacked local people thought to have assisted the Mai-Mai, killing civilians and laying waste to their villages.   Ugandan soldiers also formed and supported the front organization called RCD-National, which appeared to be an operation to extract and market the rich mineral resources of the Bafwasende area rather than the political party which it claimed to be. This blatant exploitation of Congolese wealth for the benefit of both locally based and other more highly placed Ugandan military officers symbolized the larger exploitation of the whole region for the benefit of outside actors.   Recommendations to the United States   1. Strongly and publicly denounce violations of international humanitarian law by all parties in the DRC war and insist upon accountability for the perpetrators. Exert strong and consistent pressures on all foreign countries involved in the war as well as on the Congolese government to observe their obligations under international humanitarian and human rights law. Exert similar pressure on rebel groups and local militia to also observe the prescriptions of such law.   2. Support measures to document crimes against humanity and other gross violations of international humanitarian law during this conflict. The U.S. should encourage the U.N. Security Council to resume an investigation into these crimes stalled since 1998. It should ensure that adequate resources are provided for these investigations.   3. Press President Kabila to implement the promised reforms of the civilian and military judicial systems, to permit the promised openness to political parties, human rights groups and other forms of civil society. It should insist that he issue immediate orders that the Congolese army observe the rules of international humanitarian law and bring to justice those who violate this law.   4. Call on rebel groups and their backers to ensure that civil society be permitted to function undisturbed in zones under their control.   5. Insist that all parties to the conflict instruct their forces to immediately observe the rules of international humanitarian law and hold accountable any of their combatants who fail to do so. All parties should allow unfettered access and the neutral provision of humanitarian assistance to all populations in need.   6. Demand that all parties involved in the war immediately cease the recruitment and use of child soldiers and provide for their demobilization and reintegration into society.   7. Increase its humanitarian aid to the DRC and involve local nongovernmental organizations in its distribution.   8. Support the strengthening the human rights part of the mandate of the UN force in the DRC so that human rights monitors are deployed in all locations where observers are present.","Africa, United States, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

We also take note of your remarks quoted in As-Sabah of May 11, about accountability for public officials: """"We have not hesitated, nor shall we hesitate, to ask for an explanation of whosoever is guilty of neglect of duty or commiting an offence or an abuse, whatever his position."""" More generally, you vowed that human rights """"will be further enhanced and consolidated in the future.""""  To restore to Me. Hosni all of his rights as a citizen and lawyer would be among the most significant steps you could take in pursuit of this objective. It is our hope that the passports of Nejib and his wife Thouraya will be returned to them without delay, and that they will be free to travel. We also hope that Me. Hosni will be permitted to practice law without conditions and that his telephone service will be restored. And Me. Hosni, along with all other members of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia, should be free to meet, speak, and conduct activities on its behalf despite the refusal to date by the government to grant it legal recognition.  Me. Hosni was jailed in December 2000, first to serve a fifteen-day sentence on charges of disobeying a court order to refrain from practicing law, and then to serve the remainder of an eight-year sentence from which he had been conditionally released in 1996. That original eight-year sentence was imposed after Me. Hosni was convicted of drawing up and using a fraudulent contract, charges that were criticized by Human Rights Watch and many other human rights organizations as fabricated in order to punish Hosni for his outspoken human rights work.  Once again, we are gratified that Me. Hosni is home from prison and look forward to further signs that all human rights defenders will soon be able to work and speak freely in Tunisia.

The inquiry should examine whether the French government ordered or tolerated the use of torture and summary executions against supporters of Algerian independence in the mid-1950s, as recently alleged by General Paul Aussaresses, and lead to prosecution of those considered responsible, as such crimes are not barred by a statute of limitations. The government should also initiate criminal proceedings against Gen. Aussaresses.  In a letter to President Jacques Chirac, Human Rights Watch said the revelations in the book Special Services, Algeria 1955-1957, and in articles written by Gen. Aussaresses indicated that French civilian and military authorities may have been complicit in a policy of war crimes and crimes against humanity. In his book, Aussaresses described in detail his own participation in torturing prisoners to death and in extrajudicial executions of Algerian activists, including National Liberation Front leader Larbi Ben M'Hidi.  Aussaresses alleges that torture was """"tolerated, if not recommended"""" by high French officials who had an """"exact knowledge"""" of his actions.  """"The Aussaresses case has rekindled a national debate about how to address French activities in Algeria almost 50 years ago,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But that doesn't mean that France can avoid its responsibility to find the truth and to do justice.""""  Human Rights Watch commended President Chirac for saying that he was """"horrified"""" by Gen. Aussaresses disclosures and for calling for disciplinary sanctions against him and his suspension from the prestigious Legion of Honor. """"But the gravity of Aussaresses' crimes demands much more,"""" said Roth. """"For France to ignore allegations of war crimes as have been made in this case would seriously undermine efforts around the world to enforce these essential standards.""""  The rights group, based in New York, noted that opposing Algerian forces also violated humanitarian law by targeting civilians, but said this did not provide valid grounds or excuse for France to use summary executions or torture, nor excuse it from probing these matters now.  In its letter to President Chirac, Human Rights Watch said that the government should also initiate criminal proceedings against Gen. Aussaresses. It noted that a policy of summary executions and torture is a crime against humanity, which under international law is not subject to statutes of limitations or to the French amnesty laws that purport to cover the events in Algeria.  Human Rights Watch has recently made similar recommendations to the government of the United States regarding the allegations, which surfaced around the case of former Senator Bob Kerrey, that United States troops committed violations of international humanitarian law during the Vietnam War.","Europe/Central Asia, Middle East/North Africa, France, Algeria","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/15/china-human-rights-conditions-and-us-policy","China- Human Rights Conditions and US Policy","China: Human Rights Conditions and U.S. Policy","Statement by Mike Jendrzejczyk to the Congressional Human Rights Caucus","05/15/2001","The scope of political repression in China is well known. But it affects Chinese citizens in many ways, and not only dissidents are victims of abuse. Just last week, eight members of a book club were detained in Hunan province ?not for reading banned books, or inviting dissidents to speak ?but simply for holding a meeting without government permission. According to the wife of the book club's founder, Mr. Xiao Qingming, a former middle school teacher, the meeting was shut down because the book club had failed to register with the authorities. This rather bizarre incident is symptomatic of human rights conditions in China. On the one hand, there are now thousands of social organizations of all kinds, including consumer groups, environmental organizations, women's groups, and so on. They are allowed to function under official auspices of some kind ?so long as they register with the government. In China today, freedom of association remains tightly controlled. Any group ?a trade union, a religious congregation, an anti-corruption monitoring group, or even a book club, it seems ?can get into trouble if it tries to operate independently.  The leadership of the Chinese Communist Party seems obsessed with maintaining its grip on political power, while at the same time trying to prop up its credibility by promoting economic reforms and market openings. The preoccupation with preserving social stability is a perennial aspect of one-party rule, but it has been fueled in recent years by a rise in worker and farmer protests, serious urban unemployment, and separatist movements in Tibet and Xinjiang. It is also related to the succession struggle now underway in Beijing in the run up to next year's Communist Party Congress. Strike Hard"""" Anti-Crime Campaign: Last December, as China's leaders became increasingly worried about growing social unrest, top officials began sounding the alarm, warning that China's entry into the World Trade Organization might trigger even greater unrest and instability. Wei Jianxing, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Party's Central Committee, urged public security and judicial departments to crack down on """"hostile forces both at home and abroad, elements that undermine ethnic unity, key members of cult organizations, criminal offenders and economic crime offenders,"""" according to Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency (December 2, 2000). Then, this past January, police officials called on all cities to beef up their anti-riot police, complaining that existing anti-riot police were poorly trained and equipped and """"hardly capable of maintaining social peace and stability."""" Following the Tiananmen Square demonstrations in 1989, a paramilitary police force was created to handle large-scale protests. China's major cities are required to create anti-riot units of at least 300 officers. Meanwhile, the city of Beijing, as part of its bid to host the Olympics in 2008, has touted the creation of a new anti-terrorist squad, designed to prevent terrorist groups from disrupting the games.  Finally, the leadership gathered for a two-day National Public Order Work Meeting in Beijing on April 2, and, on April 3, President Jiang Zemin announced the launching of another major """"Strike Hard"""" anti-crime campaign, making it clear that the authorities are determined to preserve social stability at all costs. The first such anti-crime campaign took place in 1983. Local authorities are given broad discretion to crack down on organization crime and corruption, suspected separatists, dissidents and others, using expedited arrest, trial and sentencing procedures. In the past, these campaigns have resulted in large-scale human rights abuses as even the minimal protections and legal safeguards in Chinese law are disregarded, and arbitrary arrests and summary executions become routine. """"The drive is not an expedient response to the recent explosions and other violence crimes, but a long-term endeavor to achieve the ultimate goal of improving China's public order,"""" said Xiao Yang, president of People's Supreme Court said, according to Xinhua. Already there has been an upsurge in arrests and executions. Amnesty International has cited China as the world's leading executioner, with at least 1,263 executions in 1999 and 2,088 death sentences, many obtained through unfair trials and the use of torture to extract confessions. Many are given the death sentence for violent crimes. With the """"Strike Hard"""" campaign underway, the government-controlled media is putting the public spotlight on the tough official response. On one day alone in April, it said at least 37 persons were executed and 50 sentenced to death in several cities across the country. Mass rallies took place in cities in Guangdong province to announce the formal arrests of 5,485 people """"suspected of involvement in organized crime, drug trafficking, and murder,"""" the official media declared.  Ongoing Human Rights Violations: But even before """"Strike Hard,"""" throughout the past year the Chinese government systematically suppressed independent political activities of all kinds. It tightened controls on unofficial religious activity as potentially subversive, while singling out the Falun Gong meditation group for particularly harsh repression. Members of the China Democracy Party have been given prison terms ranging from five to ten years. Some of the worst abuses continued to occur in the ethnic minority areas, including Tibet and Xinjiang. In Tibet, Chinese authorities suppressed suspected """"splittist"""" activities and exerted control over Tibet Buddhist religious institutions. Detention of monks and nuns for their peaceful pro-independence activities continued. China's vice president, Hu Jintao, speaking at the National People's Congress in March, said that """"while legal religious activities...will be protected, illegal activities under the cover of religion must be resolutely stopped and punishment according to law."""" In Xinjiang, the """"Strike Hard"""" campaign is aimed at suspected religious fundamentalists, violent terrorists, and """"splittists."""" Last September, Premier Zhu Rongji visited Xinjiang and called for an """"iron fist"""" approach to such groups. Human Rights Watch remains deeply concerned about Rebiya Kadeer, sentenced in March 2000 to eight years in prison. Once again, we call for her immediate and unconditional release and the release of her secretary, Kahriman Abdukerim, serving a three year administrative sentence. Ms. Kadeer's son was freed from a reeducation through labor camp this past February. Some recent examples of the ongoing, widespread abuses of internationally recognized human rights in China: ?Crackdown on Falun Gong: On July 22, 1999 the Ministry of Civil Affairs, which registers all social organizations, labeled Falun Gong an illegal organization and accused it of spreading """"superstition"""" and """"endangering social stability."""" Thousands of Falun Gong members have been sent to reeducation through labor camps, though most have served only brief terms, then been released and returned to their home villages. Those considered the dangerous ring leaders or organizers have been given stiff prison terms.  Most recently, on April 24, a Falun Gong practitioner, Ms. Zhang Xueling, whose story was featured in a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in the Wall Street Journal, was reportedly sentenced to three years in a labor camp for """"using a cult to undermine the implementation of law."""" Zhang had protested the reported beating death of her mother (also a Falun Gong member) by police last year. At this past March's meeting of the National People's Congress, Premier Zhu Rongji made it clear that the fierce crackdown on Falun Gong will continue. He denounced the group as """"anti-human"""" and said Falun Gong was being used by """"domestic and overseas forces hostile to our socialist government."""" ?Controls on the Internet: Over the past year, new regulations and controls have been imposed on use of the Internet, including censorship of foreign news sites, the creation of special Internet police, and actions to shut down Internet sites posting information on corruption or articles critical of government. Internet cafes are required to register and inform the police about their customers. The Ministry of State Security has installed tracking devices on Internet service providers to monitor individual email accounts. And bulletin boards critical of the government have been shut down. On June 3, 2000 a computer engineer named Huang Qi, in Chengdu, Sichuan province, was detained for setting up China's first domestic human rights web site. It began as an electronic bulletin board to help trace missing persons, then last year was used to post messages on the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Huang Qi was officially charged with subversion. When he was first detained, Human Rights Watch asked U.S. companies involved with the Internet in China to intervene on his behalf, to urge the government not to put him on trial. This was at the height of the debate over Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China, when some U.S. business groups claimed they were """"sowing the seeds of democracy"""" by their presence in China. But to our knowledge, no company was willing to intervene, even privately, with Chinese officials. We also asked the World Bank to intervene, since the Bank says it is interested in promoting more openness in China through free exchange of information via the Internet. When Huang Qi went on trial in February, the American consulate in Chengdu and the European Union tried to send diplomatic observers to the trial, but they were turned away. The trial was suddenly adjourned when Huang Qi was taken ill. It has yet to resume. In mid-March, Yang Zili, another young computer specialist, was detained in Beijing by state security officials; his present whereabouts and legal status are unknown. While a student, he had set up a discussion group, and he also ran a website for exchange of ideas among intellectuals which was shut down after his arrest. Mr. Yang was known for his ability to run rings around firewalls and other government attempts to censor the Internet. ?Violations of workers rights: Violations of basic workers rights in China are an urgent concern that require greater attention by the international community. On February 28, 2001, China ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, an important UN human rights treaty. However, it took a reservation on part of a key provision in Article 8 of the treaty, covering workers' right to form and join trade unions of their choosing. China's laws currently recognize only one government-sponsored workers' organization, the All China Federation of Trade Unions. All attempts to organize independent unions have been systematically crushed.  For example, Zhang Shanguang tried to organize a free labor union in Hunan province. He was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1998, charged with endangering state security. Cao Maobing tried to organize workers in a silk factory in Jiangsu province; he was detained and is now being kept in a mental hospital. Yet it is in China's long term interest to allow greater freedom of association by Chinese workers. The dismantling of state-run enterprises has already created more than 20 million unemployed. Once China joins the WTO, pressures will increase on dislocated workers who risk losing medical, educational, housing and other work-related benefits. Disgruntled workers will have no other option but to take to the streets if they cannot peacefully organize to protect their rights and interests. The U.S. and other major trading partners should urge Beijing to immediately accept the offer of the International Labor Organization (ILO) to send a direct contact mission to China to help reform its labor laws and practices to bring them into conformity with ILO standards on the basic right of free association. ?Hong Kong (Special Autonomous Region): Hong Kong is facing a crucial test of its """"one country, two systems"""" formula. I was in Hong Kong a few weeks ago, and the SAR's solicitor general assured me that so long as Falun Gong members obeyed Hong Kong's laws, they could function freely in Hong Kong. Yet Mr. C.H. Tung, Hong Kong's chief executive, has repeatedly threatened the organization, using the same rhetoric to attack it as is used in Beijing. This has raised fears among many that if Jiang Zemin was embarrassed by the Falun Gong protests during his visit to Hong Kong to speak at an international business conference on May 8-10, the group may also be banned in Hong Kong, or that Falun Gong's activities could be used as a pretext to pressure Hong Kong to enact an anti-subversion law or an anti-cult law. Jiang used his speech to criticize those """"creating tension"""" in Hong Kong. Although SAR authorities did allow Falun Gong members and pro-democracy activists to demonstrate, more than 100 Falun Gong members ?including some U.S. citizens ?were banned from entering Hong Kong. Donald Tsang, the SAR's chief secretary, defended the government's overreaction by referring vaguely to """"undesirable elements"""" who were kept out. ?Detained China Scholars: Another threat to Hong Kong's long term autonomy is the detention of several China scholars, two of them Hong Kong-based, while traveling in the mainland. This has already had a chilling affect in Hong Kong, where cross border academic exchanges and business ties are vital for the SAR's continued prosperity and development. On May 7, over 100 Hong Kong-based academics signed an open letter calling for the release of the scholars, including Prof.. Li Shaomin, a U.S. citizen teaching business at the City University of Hong Kong. He was picked up by the Chinese police when he went across the border into Shenzhen on February 25, 2001. Mr. Li also ran an Internet company in south China. Though the U.S. has been given consular access to him, his detention remains unexplained. The authorities say he is being interrogated on suspicion of spying for Taiwan.  Nearly 700 leading academics worldwide ?from Hong Kong, the U.S., Australia, Japan, Europe, and elsewhere ?have sent a similar appeal to President Jiang, expressing deep concern about Prof. Li; also, raising concern about the detention of Dr. Gao Zhan, a permanent resident of the U.S. and research scholar based at American University held since February 11 and apparently charged with spying; and Dr. Xu Zerong, a former legal resident of Hong Kong detained last October. (See the text of this extraordinary appeal, attached). We welcomed President Bush's public statement last week, urging China to treat fairly U.S. citizens who have been detained, while also supporting expanded economic ties with China. Clearly, the U.S. should continue to speak up, and to work through private diplomatic channels at senior levels to clarify these cases, and those of other detained U.S. citizens or permanent residents -- including the businessman, Liu Yaping, a U.S. permanent resident, who is detained in Inner Mongolia and apparently has serious health problems. U.S. policy on human rights in China: If China is to be a reliable trading partner, the rule of law is essential, and China's government must demonstrate its willingness to observe international rules and standards. This includes international rules and standards ?which Beijing says it supports ?governing respect for fundamental human rights. What are some of the effective steps the U.S. could take to encourage greater respect for human rights in China? 1) First, the Administration should work out a multilateral strategy with other countries and with the United Nations. This is even more urgently needed in the wake of developments over the past several weeks. Human Rights Watch supported the U.S. effort at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva to promote a resolution critical of China's human rights record. However, a dismal failure of political will again led the Commission to endorse China's procedural motion to kill the resolution before its substance could even be debated. The motion was adopted, with 23 voting for, 17 against, and 12 abstentions with one government absent.  Notwithstanding the loss of a U.S. seat on the Commission, we urge the Administration to remain active and outspoken on China at the Commission and in other UN bodies. Even without having a place on the Commission, the U.S. can still put forward and cosponsor ?with other governments holding a seat ?country resolutions.  And the U.S. should certainly remain active through diplomatic channels, for instance working with other governments to press China to accept a visit by the UN special rapporteur on torture and ill-treatment. The U.N. rights expert has been trying to negotiate a visit for nearly two years. 2) Secondly, we hope that the Congressional leadership and the President will move quickly to appoint the members of a special Congressional-Executive Commission on China to monitor and report on human rights, labor rights, religious freedom and carry out other activities to highlight abuses in China. This commission, modeled on the Helsinki commission, was mandated under the PNTR law enacted last year, but it has not yet been appointed or hired staff. A first report is due this October. We urge the Administration and Congress to strengthen the commission by significantly increasing its budget ?only a paltry $500,000 was appropriated for this first start-up year's operations ?and by adopting legislation requiring an annual debate and vote on the commission's report and its policy recommendations. It would also be extremely useful if a delegation of commission members could travel to China this summer in advance of President Bush's visit to Shanghai for the APEC summit in late October. We have recommended that the commission post some of its staff at the U.S. embassy in Beijing and in Lhasa, Tibet. (See Asian Wall Street Journal article, attached.) 3) Finally, we strongly support the passage of legislation with a code of conduct for American companies ?and their suppliers and subcontractors ?operating in China, to assure U.S. consumers and shareholders that at a minimum, they are fully respecting the rights of their workers. With China poised to enter the WTO this year, giving American companies a major incentive to invest, it is crucial that U.S. businesses do everything they can to promote respect for basic rights. Such a code should include principles dealing with child labor, the use of bonded labor and forced labor to manufacture goods in prison or labor camps, protection of the right of freedom of association and assembly by workers, and a ban on discrimination in hiring or promotion based on labor, political or religious activity.","Asia, China and Tibet","Children's Rights, Child Labor, Free Speech"

In a 24-page report, Burying the Evidence: The Botched Investigation into a Mass Grave in Chechnya, the organization documents the Russian government’s botched investigation of a mass gravesite discovered in late February 2001. This week senior European Union and United Nations officials are preparing for meetings with President Putin in Moscow. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov will be meeting Secretary of State Colin Powell in Washington on Friday, May 18. Human Rights Watch called on the international community to press Russia at these meetings for a new investigation and for the implementation of last month's U.N. resolution on Chechnya.  """"This is powerful evidence of some of the worst abuses in Chechnya,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"This week is a key opportunity for leaders to get some answers from the Russian government about the mass grave, and to demand a serious investigation.""""  In late February, fifty-one bodies were found in Dachny, an abandoned village less than one kilometer from the main Russian military base in Chechnya. According to the report, of the nineteen victims whose corpses were identified by relatives, sixteen were last seen as Russian federal forces took them into custody. Two weeks later, the authorities buried the rest of the bodies without prior notice and without performing adequate autopsies or collecting crucial evidence that would have helped to identify the perpetrators. The Russian government failed to provide help or resources for the only forensic examiner for Chechnya, whose only tools were a scalpel and a pair of rubber gloves.  Last month the U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on Chechnya that condemned serious human rights violations by Russia's forces, and raised concern about forced disappearances, torture, and summary executions. Sponsored by the E.U., and with strong U.S. backing, the resolution called for U.N. special rapporteurs to investigate these abuses in the war-torn republic and for credible criminal investigations by domestic agencies into all human rights and humanitarian law violations. Russia rejected a similar resolution adopted by the commission last year, and refused to comply with its requirements. It has vowed to do the same this year.  """"The E.U. and the U.S. took a principled stand against impunity at the Human Rights Commission,"""" said Cartner. """"Now they have to follow through and send a united message to Russia that is has to uphold its obligations under the resolution. The commission's credibility and effectiveness are at stake, and justice for the victims hangs in the balance.""""  Secretary General Kofi Annan meets with Putin today, and the E.U.-Russia summit will open on Thursday; U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell will meet with Ivanov on Friday.  Human Rights Watch is calling on all three to urge Russia to:  Exhume the 32 unidentified bodies, conduct thorough forensic autopsies, and make all efforts to establish the identity of the victims and the cause of death;  Investigate fully allegations of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, including cases of extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances; prosecute all military and police personnel, government officials and their agents found responsible;  Issue invitations to the U.N. special rapporteur on torture, the special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, and the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention; and  Remove all obstacles to the redeployment of the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","International Justice"

President Obasanjo is on a state visit to Washington, D.C. and will be meeting with President George W. Bush and U.S. government officials, who should reiterate the need for the Nigerian military to adhere to international human rights standards.  The U.S. military is eager to have Nigeria, the largest country in West Africa, take up peacekeeping duties in war-torn countries in the region, such as Sierra Leone. But Human Rights Watch has documented war crimes committed by Nigerian peacekeepers in Sierra Leone in January 1999, as well as atrocities within Nigeria itself.  """"The Nigerian military has been responsible for serious abuses,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"If the United States wants to make the Nigerians a partner in peacekeeping, they have to demonstrate a real commitment to human rights.""""  The Nigerian military has a history of serious human rights abuse, including under the current civilian government. In November 1999, the army destroyed the small town of Odi, in Bayelsa State, in the heart of the oil-producing area of the Niger Delta, following the murder of twelve policemen by a gang of youths based in the town. The army killed hundreds of people - possibly more than 2,000 - the great majority of them unarmed.  The lack of accountability for this massacre is reflected in ongoing human rights abuses by the security forces, including summary executions and arbitrary arrests of members of groups pressing for greater autonomy for the southwest and southeast of the country.  President Obasanjo recently fired the three heads of the armed services in Nigeria, reportedly for reasons linked to their opposition to US training of Nigerian troops, which included a human rights element.","Africa, United States, Nigeria, US Foreign Policy","International Justice"

A Justice Ministry spokesperson this week refused to answer Human Rights Watch's inquiry as to how the new law was being implemented and how many prisoners had been allowed out of their cells.  """"It's been ten days now since the amendment's been adopted,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, Human Rights Watch researcher on Turkey. """"Every day that passes without a single prisoner emerging from isolation is a terrible disappointment. The Justice Ministry must stop this crisis and get its prisoners out of isolation now.""""  The 1991 Anti-Terror Law required that inmates be held permanently in one- or three- person cells with no contact with other prisoners. This provision was ignored until December 2000, when thousands of soldiers entered prisons to move inmates to newly constructed F-type prisons. The transfer operation resulted in the deaths of thirty prisoners and two soldiers.  The May 1 amendment to the Anti-Terror Law removed legal obstacles to allowing prisoners out of their cells during the day for education, training, and sport. But lawyers and prisoners' relatives have told Human Rights Watch that the lockdown in F-type prisons persists. To Human Rights Watch's knowledge, no prisoners in any of the four existing F-type prisons have been permitted out of their units since the amendment's adoption. The Justice Ministry's reticence appears to confirm this.  In the ten days since amendment was adopted, two more hunger-striking prisoners have died. The prisoners have been striking since October 2000, in protest against the isolation policy in the new prisons. To date, eighteen prisoners and four relatives have died. The Turkish government has tried to maintain a media blackout on the crisis. On April 27 the Istanbul-based Voice of Anatolia radio station was shut down for three months because it had broadcast a program on the prison crisis. The Council of Europe's Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) has repeatedly called for an end to small-group isolation in F-type prisons. In two weeks, the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member, will be discussing the CPT's annual report for 2000 at a meeting in Istanbul.  """"We hope that the Council of Europe will be doing all it can to break the deadlock before its arrival in Turkey,"""" said Sugden. """"While the Justice Ministry defies the Committee for the Prevention of Torture's recommendations, prisoners are being ill-treated in isolation.""""  Small group isolation is physically and psychologically damaging, but is also making prisoners more vulnerable to ill-treatment. Staff has reportedly beaten prisoners for failing to present themselves for roll call and for shouting slogans during cell searches. On April 23, guards beat Yunus ?g?, on hunger strike since his transfer to Sincan F-type Prison, when he was unable to rise to his feet for roll call, according to his father. He was subsequently hospitalized for several days, apparently for injuries resulting from the beating, and has now been returned to Sincan Prison.  The amendment, the result of pressure from domestic and international human rights organizations, makes access to out-of-cell activities conditional on prison resources and security considerations.  Lawyers and prisoners' relatives fear that prison administrators intent on keeping prisoners locked down will manipulate this loophole. The CPT has said that the vast majority of F-type prisoners does not present a security risk and should not be left indefinitely in their cells.  In past months, the Justice Ministry had stated repeatedly that prisoners would be allowed out-of-cell activities even before the adoption of the legal reform measure, but did not live up to this commitment. Since January, Human Rights Watch has urged that, in view of the crisis, any F-type prison lacking sufficient resources for immediate implementation of out-of-cell programs should, as an interim measure, permit prisoners on the same corridor to associate by opening cell doors during daylight hours.  Human Rights Watch first addressed the these issues with the Turkish government in a July 1999 memorandum warning that the planned regime of small group isolation might amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and would expose prisoners to an increased risk of ill-treatment or torture.

This provision obligates each State Party never to undertake under any circumstances to assist, encourage, or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under the Convention. In particular, Human Rights Watch and the ICBL have called for States Parties to reach a common interpretation of the term """"assist,"""" especially relative to (a) the use of antipersonnel mines by non States Parties in joint operations with States Parties and (b) the stockpiling and transit of foreign antipersonnel mines. It appears that various States Parties may have significantly different understandings about what acts are permitted. Human Rights Watch has prepared the following list of questions about joint military operations in order to help determine whether States Parties consider such actions to be prohibited. Human Rights Watch urges States Parties to clarify their views on the legality of joint operations with non States Parties using mines, as well as foreign stockpiling and transit of antipersonnel mines. BACKGROUND CONVENTION ON THE PROHIBITION OF THE USE, STOCKPILING, PRODUCTION AND TRANSFER OF ANTIPERSONNEL MINES AND ON THEIR DESTRUCTION, 18 SEPTEMBER 1997 Article 1 General obligations 1. Each State Party undertakes never under any circumstances: a) To use antipersonnel mines; b) To develop, produce, otherwise acquire, stockpile, retain or transfer to anyone, directly or indirectly, antipersonnel mines; c) To assist, encourage or induce, in any way, anyone to engage in any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention. Article 7 Transparency measures 1. Each State Party shall report to the Secretary-General of the United Nations as soon as practicable, and in any event not later than 180 days after the entry into force of this Convention for that State Party on: a) The national implementation measures referred to in Article 9; Article 9 National implementation measures Each State Party shall take all appropriate legal, administrative and other measures, including the imposition of penal sanctions, to prevent and suppress any activity prohibited to a State Party under this Convention undertaken by persons or on territory under its jurisdiction or control. PLANNING Do States Parties specifically consider antipersonnel mines during their national review of alliance mission requirements and force structure? Do State Parties agree to adopt plans that include antipersonnel mines as an element of collective self-defense operations, e.g. NATO Article 5 Operations? Are there different mechanisms to review plans or mission requirements for national formations contributed to operations by a State Party as opposed to their national forces committed to a multinational formation? Can a member of an international military staff who is a national of a State Party participate in planning for an alliance contingency or crisis operation that includes the use of antipersonnel mines? Can an official of a State Party participate as a member of a joint engineering panel, such as NATO's Engineering Panel (Panel 9), when antipersonnel mines are addressed? Can a State Party review or approve changes to manuals or guidelines regarding antipersonnel mines, such as NATO's: STANAG 2036. """"Land Mine Laying, Marking, Recording and Reporting Procedures."""" Edition 5. 2 February 1987. STANAG 2889. """"Marking of Hazardous Areas and Routes Through Them."""" Edition 3. 26 March 1984 STANAG 2990. """"Principles and Procedures for the Employment in Land Warfare of Scatterable Mines With a Limited Laid Life - ATP-50."""" Edition 1. 15 September 1988. COMMAND AND CONTROL What authority does a commander of a multinational unit, who is a national of a State Party, have regarding the use of antipersonnel mines by non State Party forces under their command? Is there specific national or ministerial guidance by States Parties regarding the role and actions that officials who are their nationals can take in a multinational headquarters regarding antipersonnel mines? Can a commander from a State Party approve rules of engagement that permit the use of antipersonnel mines by the military forces of a non State Party? Is there a specific national review procedure among States Parties regarding antipersonnel mines for the transfer of command authority from a national commander to a multinational commander? Is there similar consideration for ad hoc cross-assignment (task-ordering) of national forces of States Parties to non State Party military formations during the course of combat operations? LOGISTICS Must a non State Party declare the types of ammunition it transfers at the point(s) of entry/exit to a State Party? Can a company performing maintenance or security services on ammunition stockpiles, which include antipersonnel mines belonging to a non State Party, legally operate in a State Party? Is the answer different if this company is a locally owned subsidiary, a subcontractor, or a foreign owned entity? Can a national of a State Party perform maintenance or security services on a non State Party's ammunition stockpile that includes antipersonnel mines? Can an aircraft or merchant vessel of a State Party, whether routinely or taken up from trade during an emergency, transport ammunition stores that contain antipersonnel mines under contract to a non State Party? Can a State Party hosting a non State Party's stockpile of antipersonnel mines allow that non State Party to transfer those antipersonnel mines for contingency military operations in another region? Can the forces of State Party """"supply"""" antipersonnel mines to a combat unit of a non State Party while serving as part of an organic combat service support component in a multinational combat formation? Can military personnel from a State Party posted as part of a reciprocal cross-national support assignment to a military unit of a non State Party perform routine job functions such as the issue and receipt, maintenance, or security of antipersonnel mines? Can a merchant ship flagged to a non State Party or a vessel in the naval service of a non State Party that carries ammunition stores that include antipersonnel mines enter or transit the territorial waters of a State Party? Can such vessels berth or take on fuel or supplies at port facilities of a State Party? Can nationals of a State Party board or serve aboard such vessels? Can a tugboat or pilot from a State Party assist such vessels? OPERATIONS Can a crewmember from a State Party in a multinational airborne early warning and control aircraft (AWAC) provide in-flight guidance and control to combat aircraft of a non State Party whose mission is to deploy antipersonnel mines? Can State Party members of a multinational target selection (weaponeering) staff participate in the planning for operations that involve the use of antipersonnel mines? Can such personnel promulgate a tasking order to execute such a mission even if aircraft from a non State Party carry it out? Can a State Party provide tactical intelligence information to support the use of antipersonnel mines by a non State Party? Can a tanker aircraft of a State Party perform in-flight refueling for aircraft of a non State Party carrying antipersonnel mine dispensers? Is a State Party permitted to use for combat operations an airfield on the territory of a non State Party that is protected by antipersonnel mines? Can the military forces of a State Party participate in exercises that include the use of antipersonnel mines on the territory of a non State Party? Can a State Party host a command post exercise that includes the use of antipersonnel mines by a non State Party? Is military advantage derived from antipersonnel minefields emplaced prior to entry-into-force of the treaty? Do national forces of a State Party serving under the United Nations flag derive such benefit? Does the same apply to members of a multinational observer forces? Do military trainers of a State Party performing advisory missions in a non State Party derive benefit from the use of antipersonnel mines by the forces of that non State Party? Can such trainers provide military advice regarding antipersonnel mines to the forces of the non State Party? Can an exchange officer from a State Party teach a class on antipersonnel mine warfare tactics while posted to a service school of a non State Party? Can an exchange officer from a State Party serving in a combat unit of a non State Party participate in training or mission planning involving the use of antipersonnel mines?

The government's heavy-handed tactics have enflamed what began as a peaceful local student protest into a violent national crisis,"""" said Saman Zia-Zarifi, Human Rights Watch's Academic Freedom Director. """"The attacks on academic freedom have now degenerated into a wholesale assault on civil society in Ethiopia.""""  On the morning of May 8, armed security forces arrested Prof. Mesfin Woldemariam and Berhanu Nega, both prominent academics and human rights activists. Prof. Mesfin, who was fired from his teaching position in 1991, was a founder of the Ethiopian Human Rights Council, a monitoring organization. His detention follows that of several dozen members of civil and political groups critical of the Ethiopian government. Authorities claim these opposition figures instigated the recent student protests.  However, eyewitness testimony and information from local sources indicate that Ethiopian authorities responded with brutal violence to students demanding greater academic freedom, and are now using the ensuing crisis to justify a general crackdown on figures critical of the government.  Security forces attacked students at Addis Ababa University on April 11, injuring more than fifty students. A week later, at least forty people were killed during raids at the university by heavily armed members of the Special Forces branch of the security forces. Eyewitnesses claim that the police raid on students escalated into widespread riots around Addis Ababa as protesters disaffected with government policies joined the clashes in support of the students.  According to eyewitnesses, security forces fired live ammunition at protesters. Police reports stated that thirty-one people were killed in the raids, while hospital  sources put the number of dead as at least forty-one. Some fifty-five people were hospitalized as a result of injuries sustained during the clashes. Witnesses state that the riot police beat civilians with batons though they offered no resistance, and then turned on bystanders, including women and children. Students were dragged out of local churches and mosques, where they had sought refuge, and taken into detention.  More than two thousand students were detained during these raids. Most were released a few days later, but several who were suspected of being members of the university student council are still held incommunicado. The security forces have also rounded up nearly 150 political activists and journalists critical of the government, many of whom are being held without any information as to their whereabouts.  According to the testimony of newly released student detainees, they were taken to the Sendafa police training college outside Addis Ababa, where they received only bread and water once a day. Students were disciplined by being forced to run barefoot on stony ground, and were denied medical care or access to their families and lawyers. As a condition of release and readmission to the university, students said they were forced to sign a form admitting that they had participated in an illegal action and were responsible for the violence.  Police again raided the Addis Ababa University campus on April 30, arresting several students suspected of playing leadership roles in the protests. Despite the police action, and contrary to the government's public statements, Addis Ababa University remains under a student boycott in support of the detained students. The unrest has spread to at least ten other universities and scores of high schools around the country, including Alemaya University of Agriculture and Bahir-Dar Polytechnic Institute.  Academics interviewed by telephone by Human Rights Watch claim that security forces are blocking students at Addis Ababa from traveling to their home towns outside of the capital in order to prevent contact between protesters and sympathetic student groups around the country.  Background  At the root of the student protests are demands for greater academic freedom. Student groups at Addis Ababa University were engaged in ongoing negotiations with Minister of Education Genet Zewde over requests for decreased government controls over the campus. The students' main demands were permission to republish a banned student magazine, dismissal of two university administrators closely affiliated with the government, and removal of security troops stationed inside the campus.  While the government initially conceded the first two demands, it did not commit to a schedule for removing security forces from the universities. When students continued to press their demands, the minister of education issued an ultimatum threatening students who did not return to classes with police force. The security forces' efforts to enforce the ultimatum, coming on the heels of continuing police use of violence to quash student protests, set off the clashes on April 17 and 18 at Addis Ababa University and the chain of events leading to the current crisis.  The Human Rights Watch Academic Freedom program works with a committee prominent academic leaders and scholars, including the current and past presidents of Harvard University, Columbia University and more than a dozen other universities in the United States, as well as internationally prominent academics. Human Rights Watch urged the Ethiopian government to promptly investigate the conduct of security forces in causing the deaths during raids at Addis Ababa University; to release all students, government critics and human rights monitors still in detention, or promptly allow them the opportunity to defend themselves against formal charges in a proper court of law; and to honor academic freedom by allowing free expression at the universities.","Africa, Ethiopia","Children's Rights, Free Speech, Attacks on Education"

The inquiry should examine whether certain U.S. military policies, orders and practices during the war, particularly those regulating special operations and unconventional warfare, constituted or led directly to the commission of war crimes by U.S. forces.  In a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch said recent disclosures by former Senator Bob Kerrey concerning his service as a junior officer in a Navy SEAL team in 1969 suggested that certain military units then operated under standing orders or employed methods that directly violated the Fourth Geneva Convention, resulting in """"grave breaches"""" of that Convention, or war crimes. """"The Kerrey disclosures have reopened bitter debates about the Vietnam War,"""" said Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch. """"But that doesn't mean the U.S. can shirk its responsibility to find the truth and pursue justice. As a party to the Geneva Conventions since 1955, the U.S. had, and still has, a clear legal obligation to investigate possible war crimes by its forces in Vietnam."""" Human Rights Watch has not itself investigated the killings in Thanh Phong village, Vietnam disclosed by Senator Kerrey and takes no position on the factual dispute surrounding the precise acts committed there by his Navy SEAL team on or about February 25, 1969. The allegation that members of the team killed unarmed persons in their custody, however, warrants specific investigation by the U.S. government: if proved, such acts would clearly constitute war crimes, for which there is no statute of limitations, and should result in prosecutions. The Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (the Fourth Geneva Convention) was the operative law at the time of the Vietnam War, including at the time of the events described by Sen. Kerrey. This extends legal protection to """"those who…find themselves…in the hands of a Party to the conflict…of which they are not nationals"""" -- including, in other words, Vietnamese nationals captured by U.S. forces -- and requires that all protected persons be """"humanely treated"""" and """"protected especially against all acts of violence."""" Article 32, elaborating, prohibits States Parties from taking """"any measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands"""" - a prohibition which, as it itemizes, includes """"murder"""" and """"any other measures of brutality."""" Under Article 146, a violation of the Convention that involves """"willful killing"""" constitutes a """"grave breach"""" of the Convention, that is, a war crime and another article (Art.146) obligates states party to the Convention to search for and bring before its own courts any persons alleged to have committed such """"grave breaches"""" or ordered them to be committed. The U.S. and both South Vietnam and North Vietnam became states parties to the four 1949 Geneva Conventions years before the events disclosed by former Senator Kerrey, and were bound by their obligations throughout the conflict in Vietnam. """"Violations of the laws of war by Vietnamese forces in no way justified violations by U.S. troops,"""" said Roth. """"Nor can they relieve the U.S. of its obligation to investigate these allegations."""" In its letter to Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch said that an inquiry should also examine whether all necessary measures are now in place to ensure that U.S. troops can never be issued with orders or trained in practices that would violate the Geneva Conventions. Human Rights Watch urged that U.S. troops, whether they are deployed in international humanitarian intervention programs as in Kosovo, or to assist other governments' forces to combat rebel groups as in Colombia, should be fully trained in the requirements of international humanitarian law, and held accountable for any violations.","Asia, United States, Vietnam","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/08/human-rights-groups-respond-commission-vote","Human Rights Groups Respond to Commission Vote","Human Rights Groups Respond to Commission Vote","","05/08/2001","We are writing to share our perspectives on the proper U.S. response to the loss of its seat on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to the growing influence of human rights violators on the Commission's work.  As human rights groups, we share the concern that the current makeup of the Commission will further frustrate its mission. At the same time, we believe that efforts by countries such as China, Cuba and Sudan to undermine the Commission are not a reason for the United States to walk away from the U.N., and we urge you not to condition dues payments to the U.N. on the restoration of the U.S. seat. Such a step would make it harder, not easier, for the U.S. to regain its voice on the Commission and to strengthen the Commission's own voice as a champion of human rights. We should remember that despite its many flaws, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights has played a largely positive role in establishing the universality of basic human rights. That is why human rights violators work so hard to thwart its efforts.  For example, resolutions critical of China, one of which in 1995 came within one vote of being passed, have helped pressure Beijing to release political prisoners, to accept visits by the U.N. working group on arbitrary detention and the U.N. special rapporteur on religious intolerance, and to sign two important U.N. human rights treaties. Since 1988, strong Commission resolutions on Burma have expressed an international consensus that is impossible for that country's military regime to ignore. In 1999, a special session of the commission on the carnage in East Timor led to a call for an international inquiry and for prosecutions in Indonesian courts of those responsible. For two straight years, the Commission has condemned Russia for its abuses in Chechnya, urging that those responsible be held accountable. And this year, the Commission passed resolutions and extended mandates for U.N. special rapporteurs and representatives for countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, Iran and the Democratic Republic of Congo.  While we have not agreed with every position the United States has taken at the Human Rights Commission, such as its votes this year against a new convention to combat political disappearances and a moratorium on the death penalty, we believe it has done much to focus the world's spotlight on the most egregious human rights abuses. We hope the United States will remain committed to that task. That does not mean accepting the status quo on the Commission, or yielding to the temptation to write it off and walk away. Instead, we hope that the United States will take the process more seriously, devoting sustained high level attention and resources to multilateral diplomacy so that votes on behalf of human rights are won, not lost. Indeed, the United States can and should remain active in the next session of the Commission even without a vote.  The problems the United States has experienced on the Commission are caused by many factors: from the """"abusers solidarity"""" demonstrated by nations that resent U.N. interference, to the lack of solidarity among the United States and its democratic allies on key human rights issues like the International Criminal Court, and the perception that the United States takes its position and influence for granted. Nevertheless, if the U.S. campaigns in the traditional way to regain its seat, it stands an excellent chance of winning. But it would be a mistake for the United States to claim an absolute right to sit on the Commission, just as it was a mistake to assume its seat was unassailable. Nor should the U.S. threaten to withhold its U.N. dues, which it has a legal obligation to pay. Such a step would intensify the very resentment among key partners that contributed to the loss of its seat. It would accelerate the debilitating cycle of recriminations dividing the United States and its democratic partners on the Commission. Those victims of abuse around the world who look to the Commission to support their struggles would be the losers, and the abusers who seek to undermine the Commission the winners.  When abusers are uniting, defenders of human rights should not be bickering. Instead, the United States should join others from Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America and the Middle East to strengthen the Commission. One way to start would be to insist that all candidates for membership agree to allow the U.N.'s human rights investigators free access to their territory, a condition that would naturally apply to the U.S. as well.  Recent events at the U.N. should focus attention on the need to improve global institutions dedicated to human rights, and to ensure that the United States is at the forefront of that effort - as it was in the days when it led the way in the creation of the Commission on Human Rights and of the standards it is meant to uphold. We look forward to working with you to find constructive ways to advance that goal.

Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday.    """"Last fall, Yugoslavia was admitted to the U.N. with the expectation that it would abide by U.N. commitments -- including the requirement that member states cooperate with the tribunal,"""" said Richard Dicker, head of Human Rights Watch's International Justice program. """"Unfortunately, cooperation has been halting and President Kostunica himself has done little but denigrate the tribunal. Indeed, he has said point blank that Milosevic should never be sent to The Hague. U.N. officials should make clear that this approach is completely unacceptable.""""     Human Rights Watch called for the Secretary General and other officials to raise Hague Tribunal cooperation as a central focus of the meeting.     Following meetings at the U.N. Tuesday, Kostunica will travel to Washington, D.C., coincidentally crossing paths with Tribunal Prosecutor Carla Del Ponte, who is also in Washington this week. Kostunica will have meetings with senior U.S. government officials and representatives of the international financial institutions, where discussions will likely focus on a donors' conference for Yugoslavia, which the World Bank and the E.U. have proposed for June 1, but the U.S. has suggested be postponed until Yugoslavia demonstrates further commitment to cooperate with the tribunal.     In a letter sent to U.S. Secretary of State last week, Human Rights Watch urged that the setting of a date for a donors' conference on Yugoslavia should be tied to specific benchmarks. """"No donors' conference should be scheduled until Yugoslav citizens who have been indicted by the tribunal are sent to The Hague,"""" said Dicker. """"Kostunica must also make a public commitment that Milosevic himself will be transferred to the custody of the tribunal.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

According to Human Rights Watch sources, a group of Vu's friends met with Vu at his home in Haiphong on May 7 and have confirmed his release. Human Rights Watch welcomes the news of Vu's release, but remains concerned about continuing reports of surveillance and harassment of dissidents in Vietnam. _________________ Human Rights Watch today expressed concern about the arrest of Vietnamese dissident Vu Cao Quan on April 24, and the possibility of arrest of other democracy activists in Vietnam, including prominent former political prisoner Hoang Minh Chinh. """"The recent party congress in Hanoi raised some hopes about economic reform. But when it comes to political reform, Vietnam is drawing a line,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"We are concerned that individuals are being targeted merely because they are meeting together with other dissidents.""""  Human Rights Watch called on Vietnam's international donors to raise concerns about continuing arrests of dissidents and the need for greater openness when donors meet in Hanoi next month. On June 14-15, the World Bank will convene an interim donor meeting in Vietnam to evaluate progress on economic and social reforms.  Human Rights Watch has learned that Vu Cao Quan, 68, was arrested at 5 p.m. April 24 on his way back to his home in Hai Phong after meeting individually in Hanoi on April 22 with other democracy activists -- including well-known dissidents Nguyen Thanh Giang, Tran Do, Pham Que Duong, and Hoang Minh Chinh. Vu Cao Quan apparently did not receive a written arrest warrant or written specification of the charges against him. His family has been told that he has been arrested for writing and possessing anti-socialist documents. Before his arrest, police searched Vu's home in Hai Phong and confiscated numerous documents and books. In February, Vu was summoned to police headquarters in Hai Phong several times after he organized a meeting in Hai Phong of people interested in democracy, and invited Tran Do and Nguyen Thanh Giang to attend as speakers. Vu's wife was informed of the arrest at 11 p.m. on April 24, when police asked her to come to Hai Phong police headquarters to persuade her husband to eat because he went on hunger strike to protest his arrest. This is the last time she saw him; his current whereabouts are unknown. Vu Cao Quan is in poor health, and was hospitalized after a stroke one month ago. Two days after Vu Cao Quan's arrest, on April 26, a squad of policemen went to the home of another prominent dissident, Hoang Minh Chinh, 81, in Hanoi and insisted that he go with them to police headquarters. Hoang Minh Chinh refused and barricaded himself in his house. He has not left his home since because of fear of arrest. Prior to this, Hoang Minh Chinh had been summoned several times to Hanoi police headquarters for """"working sessions"""" to answer questions, but had refused to go. In January 1999, Vu Cao Quan resigned from the Vietnamese Communist Party together with Col. Pham Que Duong to protest the expulsion of retired Gen. Tran Do, who had been ousted from the party for his outspoken and critical views. Shortly afterwards, Vu was expelled from the Army Veterans Association. Since 1990, Vu has written a number of articles in which he advocated Western-style democracy for Vietnam, some of which circulated informally among dissidents in Vietnam or published abroad. Former high-ranking Party cadre Hoang Minh Chinh was director of the Marxist-Leninist Institute until 1967, when he was imprisoned for five years for criticizing Party policy. Since then he has been imprisoned and put under house arrest numerous times for his outspoken views.","Asia, Vietnam",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/05/06/us-urgent-need-vietnam-investigation","US- Urgent Need for Vietnam Investigation","U.S.: Urgent Need for Vietnam Investigation","","05/06/2001","Donald H. Rumsfeld Secretary of Defense 1000 Defense Pentagon Washington, D.C. 20301 Dear Secretary Rumsfeld, Human Rights Watch respectfully calls on you to initiate an urgent, thorough, and independent inquiry into allegations that standing orders and practices of the U.S. military and certain of its units may have led to systematic violations of recognized international humanitarian law in force during the Vietnam War.   Recent disclosures by former Senator Bob Kerrey, concerning his service in Vietnam as a junior officer in a Navy SEAL unit, suggest that certain U.S. military units at that time operated under standing orders and employed practices that may have directly violated the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and resulted in """"grave breaches"""" of that Convention, or war crimes. At the time of the conflict, all relevant parties were bound by the Convention, having ratified or adhered to it. Like all State Parties, the United States had, and still has, a binding legal obligation under the Convention to investigate any such alleged grave breach without statute of limitation.   Human Rights Watch has not itself investigated and thus does not take a position on the factual dispute reported in the press surrounding the precise acts committed by Sen. Kerrey and his unit at Thanh Phong, Vietnam, on or about February 25, 1969. However, the allegation that unarmed persons in their custody were killed also warrants investigation by the U.S. government because, if proved, such acts would clearly be war crimes.  The Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, or the Fourth Geneva Convention, was the operative law at the time of the war, including at the time of the events described by Sen. Kerrey. In relevant part, this defines as persons protected under the Convention """"those who...find themselves...in the hands of a Party to the conflict...of which they are not nationals."""" Article 27 requires that all protected persons be """"humanely treated"""" and """"protected especially against all acts of violence."""" Article 32, elaborating, prohibits States Parties from taking """"any measure of such a character as to cause the physical suffering or extermination of protected persons in their hands"""" - a prohibition which, as it itemizes, includes """"murder"""" and """"any other measures of brutality.""""  According to Article 147, a violation of the Convention that involves """"willful killing"""" is a """"grave breach,"""" that is, a war crime. Article 146 provides that each Party to the Convention """"shall be under the obligation to search for persons alleged to have committed, or to have ordered to be committed, such grave breaches, and shall bring such persons...before its own courts.""""   Sen. Kerrey has suggested to the media that when his Navy SEAL unit killed people in two separate incidents at the village of Thanh Phong, it was acting in accordance with both standing orders that declared the relevant part of the Mekong Delta to be a """"free-fire zone"""" as well as specific instructions to his unit, and others like it, to kill anyone encountered rather than take prisoners. He has also suggested that his unit felt compelled to commit the first killing (or set of killings - the number is in dispute) so as not to compromise its mission. Under the Geneva Conventions, however, neither the creation of a """"free-fire zone"""" nor a claim of military necessity can ever justify the summary execution of persons who are noncombatants or captured combatants (Arts. 4, 32, Fourth Geneva Convention) or prisoners of war (Arts. 84, 101, Third Geneva Convention). That is, no one can ever be summarily executed, regardless of their status as combatant or noncombatant. The former Senator's assertion that his unit was operating in accordance with standard practice, or that there were standing orders, to commit such executions is especially disturbing and, notwithstanding the passage of so many years, merits the most serious investigation of the orders and practices then being employed and of those in the chain of command who might have tolerated such practices or issued such orders.   That opposing Vietnamese forces may not have abided by these rules, despite their legal obligation to do so, provides no excuse or valid grounds for summary executions by U.S. troops. Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides unequivocally that """"reprisals against protected persons...are prohibited."""" (Article 13 of the Third Geneva Convention extends similar protection to prisoners of war, although no claim has been made that POWs were involved in the case described by Sen. Kerrey.)   In light of the broad allegations arising from the case of Sen. Kerrey, and in accordance with the U.S. government's legal obligations as a State Party to the Geneva Conventions, we urge you to initiate without delay a full and independent investigation to establish whether during the Vietnam War certain U.S. military policies, orders and practices - in particular, those regulating special operations and unconventional warfare - constituted or led directly to the commission of war crimes by U.S. forces. The inquiry should also examine whether all necessary steps have been taken in the interim to ensure that there can be no repetition of these practices, including intensive training on the requirements of humanitarian law and the establishment of a strict accountability system to ensure that those responsible for violations face discipline or punishment. Such an inquiry should be carried out by a body that includes both civilians as well as military members, and its full findings should be made public.   Further, while noting Sen. Kerrey's expressed contrition regarding the events in which he took part in Thanh Phong village, Human Rights Watch considers that these events too should be fully and independently investigated, and that any person found to have committed a grave breach of the Convention should be brought to justice.   Mr. Secretary, it has long been the declared policy of the United States to promote international humanitarian law, such as the Fourth Geneva Convention. It has adopted this policy both because of a desire to spare civilians as much as possible the hazards of war and because international humanitarian law provides an essential protection for U.S. servicemembers who may be exposed to situations of conflict. Yet, the standards of humanitarian law are only as strong as the practice of enforcement. For the United States to ignore allegations of grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions as have been made in this case would seriously undermine efforts around the world to enforce these essential standards. So for this reason, too, we urge you to ensure that these most disturbing allegations are fully and promptly investigated.   We understand that this case has reopened bitter debates about the Vietnam War. But the intense feelings that the war evokes in no way diminish the U.S. government's obligation to follow the truth wherever it may lead. A nation of laws has an obligation to determine whether its actions have been consistent with the laws that govern armed conflict. And it has a duty to apply the lessons to its conduct in future conflicts. We hope you will take the initiative to explore what lessons are to be learned from these allegations and to apply those lessons going forward.   Sincerely,   /s/   Kenneth Roth Executive Director","Asia, United States, Vietnam",""

Such cases, relatively common between 1995 and 1997, seem to be becoming more frequent in a context of growing tension between Rwanda and its neighbors. Human Rights Watch urged action on the disappearances last month of a former Interior Minister and a demobilized army officer, as well as the brazen assassination of Rwandan diplomat in February. """"Rwanda has just won a vote of approval at the recent meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Rwandan authorities now have the chance to show their commitment to the rule of law by locating the missing and by bringing an assassin to justice.""""  On April 27, former Minister of the Interior Theobald Rwaka Gakwaya was last seen leaving his home, supposedly en route to a meeting of political parties in the northwestern town of Gisenyi. Rwaka, who was also the Vice-President of the Centrist Democratic Party (Parti Démocrate centriste, or PDC), was frequently at odds with the Rwandan government and lost his ministerial post in March. At the time, the semi-official press accused him of plotting against the government and of hindering recruitment by the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the party which dominates Rwandan political life. Rwaka was a founder of the Rwandan League for the Promotion and Defense of Human Rights ( LIPRODHOR), one of the most effective human rights organizations in Rwanda.  On April 7, a recently demobilized Rwandan army officer, Major Alexis Ruzindana, also disappeared en route to a destination outside the capital. He left Kigali for the southwestern town of Cyangugu in the company of another army officer, Captain Vianney Butera, who subsequently returned alone to the city. Ruzindana had come back to Rwanda with the Rwandan Patriotic Army after years of exile in Uganda. According to some military sources, Ruzindana may have fled the country to join other recently-departed RPA officers who had also spent their younger years as refugees in Uganda, including Majors Mupende and Furuma. Major Furuma has announced the formation of a political movement in opposition to the current Rwandan government.  A Burundian diplomat, Dieudonné Haburugira, was expelled from Rwanda in late April reportedly for helping Rwandan army officers leave the country to join groups opposed to the Rwandan government. He had supposedly given a Burundian visa to Ruzindana. In February, a young soldier in uniform assassinated Alphonse Mbayire, also a RPA officer and former chargé d'affairs at the Rwandan embassy in Nairobi. The crime took place in a Kigali neighborhood inhabited by a number of military officers, who have armed guards at their residences. The supposed killer, himself a guard for a military officer, was identified by name and rank by witnesses but he has apparently not yet been apprehended. He fired more than twenty bullets at close range into Mbayire's head, reportedly because he took offense at a comment Mbayire made about his dog.  Also in February a man named Jean de Dieu Dufatanye disappeared after having gone into Kigali, reportedly to meet with a former employer who is an influential member of the RPF.  In all of these cases, families of the victims have sought official assistance in finding the missing and in obtaining justice for the murder, thus far without result.","Africa, Rwanda","United Nations"

In the past ten years, we have committed substantial time and effort to investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in the former Yugoslavia. We have documented violations of international humanitarian law by all sides of the armed conflicts in Croatia, Bosnia, Kosovo, and the NATO war with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   Reports of the renewed conflict in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia between security forces and armed groups of ethnic Albanians raise concerns relating to adherence to international humanitarian law. As in all other conflicts in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, our principal concern is that all parties involved respect civilian immunity and ensure the protection of civilians.   Human Rights Watch wants to express its concern that the groups organized under the name of National Liberation Army (NLA) take all measures to comply with basic principles of international humanitarian law applicable to situations of internal armed conflict, and enshrined in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions. This provision protects those who do not take an active part in hostilities from the most serious violations, including acts of murder, torture and cruel treatment, the taking of hostages, outrages upon personal dignity, and the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgement pronounced by a regularly constituted court.   With regard to the renewed fighting, the NLA leadership should refrain from any attacks against civilians, attacks and reprisals against civilian objects, as well as threats of violence the primary purpose of which is to spread terror among the civilian population.   We also call on the NLA leadership to ensure that the civilian population of the affected areas enjoys as much protection as possible against dangers of harm resulting from the fighting. The most fundamental principle of the laws of war requires that combatants be distinguished from noncombatants, and that military objectives be distinguished from protected property or protected places. Parties to a conflict must direct their operations only against military objectives (including combatants). Also, the use of civilians as shields for defensive positions, to hide military objectives or to screen attacks, violates the principles of the international humanitarian law.   We also note that the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) applies to serious violations of international humanitarian law committed after 1991 on the territory of the former Yugoslavia, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

He said that the commission would be charged with determining all the facts """"in complete freedom and total transparency.""""  Such an initiative is badly needed, in our view, and we commend you for taking it. At the same time, we note the great skepticism of many Algerians that such a commission will serve to uncover the truth or to address the crisis underlying these disturbances. As you know, the reports of the commissions on the assassination of President Boudiaf in 1992 and the massacre in Serkadji prison in 1995 were widely criticized for failing to identify all those responsible for these killings, while the findings of the commission looking into allegations of fraud in the 1997 nationwide municipal elections were never made public.  The credibility of your government as you confront this crisis thus depends heavily on the steps you take to ensure that this commission is empowered to discover the facts, make them public, and identify those persons, including government officials, responsible for criminal wrongdoing. The work of the commission should include meetings at which the public is invited to testify concerning allegations of wrongdoing.  According to news reports, law professor Mohand Issad will head the commission. Your remarks of April 30 left uncertain the composition of the commission, beyond stating that it would include """"representatives of civil society."""" We urge you to ensure that persons appointed to the special commission enjoy, without exception, unchallenged reputations for independence, competence, integrity, and impartiality. Their number must also include persons who have proven familiarity with and expertise in human rights law as well as Algerian law, and with international law enforcement standards.  The special commission must be given the resources and authority, including subpoena powers, necessary to carry out an impartial and effective investigation. It is crucial that the government set up the commission promptly so that it can begin its investigation immediately. We urge you to define more concretely the scope of this investigation, to ensure that the commission makes violations of human rights by security forces, as well as violations of law by rioters, among its very top priorities.  The commission's mandate must therefore include the circumstances surrounding the death in custody of secondary-school student Massinissah Guermah on April 18, and the use of lethal force by the security forces in confronting and putting down the demonstrations and riots that followed. International law enforcement standards are clear that lethal force should only be used when strictly unavoidable in order to protect life. We strongly recommend that the commission's terms of reference include the U.N. Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms by Law Enforcement Officials as well as the United Nations Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary, and Summary Executions. Those principles specify that independent investigations into suspicious deaths should include opportunities for the public to testify and autopsies by physicians with forensic expertise, and that the findings of the commission be made public.  In your April 30 remarks, you stated that the commission's activities """"will have no bearing whatsoever on the outcome of the judicial investigations which prosecution offices may decide to carry out."""" What is essential is that the special commission and the office of the prosecutor, between them, exercise the responsibility of the government to identify publicly and bring to justice those persons responsible for serious violations of law, including violations of international human rights treaty law to which Algeria is party, and referring them to judicial proceedings that meet international fair trial standards.  We understand that the National Assembly has recently adopted a resolution to set up its own commission of inquiry into the same events. We recommend in addition that the government grant access to Algerian as well as international human rights organizations wishing to conduct investigations into these incidents. Such a step will greatly enhance the credibility of the national commission.  In that regard we note that Human Rights Watch has not yet received a response to our request, first made in a December 2000 letter to your excellency, to visit the country.

In a meeting today with the foreign minister of the Democratic Republic of Congo, She Okitundu, Human Rights Watch urged the government to spare the lives of the four children, who were between fourteen and sixteen years of age at the time they were arrested and sentenced to death.  Congo has executed at least one other child soldier, a fourteen-year-old who was put to death shortly after being sentenced in January 2000. The execution of individuals for crimes committed below age eighteen violates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, international human rights treaties to which Congo is a party.  Congo's military routinely recruited and used child soldiers under the late President Laurent Kabila. In June 2000, the president announced that the armed forces would demobilize child soldiers and reintegrate them into civil society. But Congo still has approximately 12,000 child soldiers, according to the United Nations Children's Fund.  """"International law is clear: No one should be put to death for a crime committed as a child,"""" said Michael Bochenek, counsel to the Children's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Congo should immediately commute these death sentences and bring its practices in line with international standards.""""  Iran, Nigeria, and the United States are the only other countries known to have imposed the death penalty on juvenile offenders. Iran executed a seventeen-year-old in 1999; Nigeria carried out a death sentence against a seventeen-year-old in 1997 for an offense committed at the age of fifteen. The United States has executed eight juvenile offenders since 1998.  Rehabilitation and reintegration into society are critical issues for children that have participated in armed conflict. Graça Machel, the U.N. Secretary-General's expert on the impact of armed conflict on children, has pointed out that child soldiers may be forcibly abducted, severely brutalized, and compelled to participate in atrocities; they are rarely autonomous actors.  The death sentences against the four children were handed down by Congo's Court of Military Order, which Human Rights Watch criticized in a February 1999 report as failing to safeguard the due process rights of those brought before it. Persons convicted by the court have no right to appeal, and many executions are carried out the same day or soon after the accused are sentenced.  The sole power to commute death sentences rests with President Kabila, who has never used the authority. His father, the late President Laurent Kabila, was known to have granted only two pardons, one for a thirteen-year-old offender sentenced to death in 1998.  The four children facing execution are Diyavanga Nkuyu, fourteen at the time of his arrest; Bosey Jean-Louis, age fifteen when arrested; and Mbumba Ilunga and Mwati Kabwe, arrested when they were sixteen years of age.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo","Children's Rights, Children and Armed Conflict"

We are greatly concerned, however, by reports that you are actively seeking a reassessment of the refugee status of up to 1.5 million Afghans currently residing in camps in Pakistan and their repatriation to Afghanistan, on the grounds that the Taliban have consolidated their control over much of Afghanistan, and that the civil war from which the refugees fled has now abated. Ironically, your statements have come at a time when Pakistani authorities are preventing UNHCR from registering new arrivals in the Jalozai camp - many of whom have fled fighting and conflict-related violence in northern Afghanistan - and have announced their intention to forcibly repatriate those who have not been recognized as refugees.   Our ongoing monitoring of conditions in Afghanistan indicates that the security situation in large parts of the country is in fact far from stable. In recent months, Taliban forces have lost significant territory in northeastern and north-central Afghanistan, and several areas are presently contested. On at least two occasions this year, Taliban forces have carried out large-scale summary executions of civilians in or near front-line areas, with apparent intent to punish perceived collaboration with the forces of the United Front.   Human Rights Watch has provided extensive documentation of one such case in Yakaolang district in January, in which Taliban forces systematically detained and summarily executed about 170 civilians, including Afghan humanitarian aid workers, after retaking the area from the United Front. A copy of our report is enclosed. In the past year, Taliban forces have shelled and bombarded civilian-populated areas in other parts of the north and forcibly relocated civilian populations. These tactics have contributed to massive internal displacement in Afghanistan and large-scale refugee flows into Pakistan since late 2000. Additionally, Human Rights Watch has received reports of rape which require further investigation.   For refugees originating from areas of southern and eastern Afghanistan, the military conflict itself may be less of a concern, but other factors - including the Taliban's systematic and pervasive mistreatment of women - militate against their return. Refugee women and girls returning to Taliban-held territory face the prospect of severe restrictions on freedom of movement, right to work, access to education and access to health care. These restrictions have particularly devastating consequences in the context of the conflict and famine within Afghanistan. Many households are headed by widows who have no ability to support themselves or their children. We are deeply concerned that if refugees are being presented with the option to repatriate, women be given sufficient information on which to make informed decisions about whether to return to Afghanistan and that they understand the hardships they will face upon their return.   Affirmative measures by UNHCR would be necessary to ensure that any repatriation scheme under its auspices is consistent with international refugee standards. This would include establishing adequately staffed screening mechanisms in the host countries to determine whether refugees have a well-founded fear of persecution that precludes their return to Afghanistan. In addition, UNHCR should monitor the protection refugees receive once they return, which in turn would necessitate obtaining guarantees of access to those parts of Afghanistan to which refugees are repatriated.   As you are aware, according to UNHCR's 1996 Handbook on Voluntary Repatriation, there are several essential preconditions that must be met before UNHCR can promote voluntary repatriation. These include:   i) an overall, general improvement in the conditions in the country of origin that enable the large majority of the refugees to return in safety and with dignity ii) all parties must be committed to fully respect the voluntary character of the repatriation iii) the country of origin must provide a formal guarantee, or adequate assurances for the safety of repatriating refugees iv) UNHCR must have free and unhindered access to refugees and returnees v) The basic terms and conditions must be incorporated in a formal repatriation agreement between UNHCR and the authorities concerned   It is our view that at present none of these essential preconditions have been met. UNHCR's promotion of a repatriation scheme under the circumstances outlined above will not only raise the prospect of returning refugees to unstable conditions where they face an unacceptable risk of harm, or persecution on the basis of their gender, but may also provide cover to forcible repatriation schemes initiated by host states, in this instance, Pakistan.   We hope that in the course of your visit, you will call on the Pakistani authorities to respect their international obligations to protect the Afghan refugees, and under no circumstances to return them to Afghanistan where their lives and freedom could be seriously endangered.   Although Pakistan has not acceded to the 1951 Refugee Convention, it is still bound under international customary law to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, and we urge you to remind the government of Pakistan of this obligation. In addition, we hope that you will be able to use this visit as an opportunity to negotiate for full and unimpeded UNHCR access to the refugees in Jalozai camp, so that UNHCR is able to register the refugees and conduct preliminary refugee status determination in order to prevent the forcible repatriation of newly arrived refugees back to Afghanistan.   We would be interested to receive any reports on your current trip and would be happy to keep you informed about human rights developments in Afghanistan.

What is Human Rights Watch's position on China getting the 2008 Olympics?  We think that the human rights record of a country should be taken into serious consideration by the International Olympic Committee in selecting the site for the 2008 Olympics, but we are not opposed a priori to China getting the Games. Experience with the 1995 U.N. Women's Conference in Beijing has shown that having thousands of people from around the world in China can focus attention on the country, including on the degree of state control and fear of political protest. 2. What kind of human rights commitments should the I.O.C. seek from the Chinese government?  We want the I.O.C. to seek written assurances that if Beijing is selected, the international media covering the Games will have unrestricted access to the country and that there will be no discrimination against journalists or participants based on their political or religious views or country of origin. We also want the I.O.C. to seek a commitment that if Beijing is selected, independent monitors will be able to have regular access to building sites to ensure that migrant workers and other residents of the areas in question are treated in accordance with international human rights standards. We want the I.O.C. to get Beijing's assurance that no one will be arrested or otherwise punished for peacefully protesting against the Games or actions taken by the government in relation to them, and that suspected dissidents will not be rounded up in advance of the Games. At past international events in China, like the 1990 Asian Games, such violations occurred.  3. As part of its bid for the 2000 Olympics, China assured the I.O.C. that it could keep order in the city. Experience shows that the Chinese government's methods of keeping order often involve violations of human rights, yet security is clearly an issue for any city in which the Games are held. How do you see the problem being resolved?  The I.O.C. should consider setting up a monitoring committee that includes at least one human rights expert to review security plans for the Games and try to ensure that safeguards against human rights violations are built in. Realistically, however, monitoring is more likely to come from independent journalists, another reason for urging the I.O.C. to insist on unrestricted access.  4. Do you think realistically that I.O.C. members will raise such issues?  If they don't, it raises serious questions about their commitment to the spirit of the Games.  5. What if the Chinese government refuses to give such commitments?  Then that should be a factor against the selection of China and, indeed, we would take the same position with respect to all contenders.  6. This is a different position than HRW took when China was trying to get the 2000 Olympics. Why?  The first Games of the new millennium were highly symbolic; we did not think they should go to a country that had such a poor human rights record, especially when the selection was taking place when the memory of Tiananmen Square was so fresh.  7. Does this mean that HRW believes that there has been significant progress in human rights since China's last Olympics bid?  No. China's human rights record remains poor, far below international standards, with arbitrary detention, torture, and violations of freedom of expression, association, assembly, and religion still widespread. In recent years, as China has tried to avoid censure at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and prepared to join the World Trade Organization, it has taken some positive steps such as ratifying one key U.N. human rights treaty and signing another, and enacting certain legal reforms. But the treaties have yet to be implemented, and many legal reforms are not fully enforced.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Human Rights Watch urged that the setting of a date for a donors' conference on Yugoslavia should be tied to specific benchmarks.   """"No donors' conference should be scheduled until Yugoslav citizens who have been indicted by the tribunal are sent to The Hague,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Kostunica must also make a public commitment that Milosevic himself will be transferred to the custody of the tribunal.""""   On March 31, the Bush administration was required by law to certify that the Yugoslav authorities were cooperating with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in order for U.S. financial assistance to continue to the country. Human Rights Watch viewed the certification as premature, but welcomed Secretary Powell's comments at the time that future U.S. support for an international donors' conference would depend on """"continued progress"""" by Yugoslavia in cooperating with the tribunal.   """"The pressure exerted on Belgrade by the U.S. government during the first months of the Kostunica government had a positive impact,"""" said Cartner. """"But the Yugoslav authorities are still far from cooperating fully with the tribunal, and additional pressure is needed. The U.S. must make clear that it wants to see concrete progress toward cooperation with the tribunal in the short-term-and that U.S. support for international lending to Yugoslavia over the long-term depends on Milosevic standing trial in The Hague.""""   With regard to the ongoing impunity of indictees currently believed to be in Bosnia, Human Rights Watch welcomed the Bush administration's recent acknowledgment that Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic bear ultimate responsibility for Srebrenica and that they must be brought to justice. Human Rights Watch urged the administration to enlist U.S. troops in Bosnia to help apprehend the remaining war crimes indictees and to transfer them to The Hague.","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

Human Rights Watch also called on Malaysian authorities to release ten opposition leaders and rights activists detained under the ISA in the past three weeks, or else charge them and ensure that they are promptly and fairly tried. ISA detainees can be held indefinitely without trial.  """"The Internal Security Act invites abuse. It strips detainees of basic rights and should be immediately repealed,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"Once again, this draconian law is being used to conduct a political witch hunt.""""  Since April 10, nine opposition leaders and one prominent human rights activist have been detained under the ISA, and held incommunicado with no access to lawyers or family. Human Rights Watch, in its global review of rights developments in 2000 (World Report 2001), noted that the human rights situation in Malaysia had deteriorated, largely because of Prime Minister Mahathir's determination to crush his political rivals. Nine of the ten who have been arrested are well-established opposition figures and most are members of the opposition party Keadilan, founded by Anwar's wife Wan Azizah.  The most recent detainee is human rights advocate Badaruddin Ismail, 56, popularly known as """"Pak Din."""" Pak Din is an activist with Suara Rakyat Malaysia (Suaram), one of a small handful of groups that dare to be openly critical of Malaysia's human rights policies. He specializes in assisting the families of persons arbitrarily detained by the state and was working on a book on the proceedings of the National Human Rights Commission's inquiry into police brutality on a rally on November 5, 2000 when he was detained on the morning of April 26.  The ISA grants extraordinary powers to the police and the executive branch to arrest and detain individuals on a preventive basis. Under the ISA a person can be detained and interrogated for up to sixty days without access to counsel. Following an initial sixty-day investigative period an ISA prisoner can be held without trial for up to two years, with the possibility of renewal every two years indefinitely. Torture, including its use to extract false confessions, has been reported by many former ISA detainees.  Any police officer may, without a warrant, arrest and detain anyone he has """"reason to believe"""" has acted or is likely to act in """"any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia."""" For the first sixty days, detainees may be held without access to lawyers. In addition to provisions for arrest, the ISA allows for restrictions on freedom of assembly, association, and expression, freedom of movement, residence and employment. It also allows for the closing of schools and educational institutions if they are used as a meeting place for an unlawful organization or for any other reason are deemed detrimental to the interests of Malaysia or the public.  Efforts by attorneys in Malaysia to compel the police to produce these latest ISA prisoners in court have so far failed. In other countries, human rights lawyers frequently use habeas corpus applications (a writ ordering a prisoner to be brought before a court to determine whether the detention is lawful) to confirm that a person held incommunicado by the authorities is alive and has not been subjected to mistreatment. In Malaysia, a 1989 amendment of the ISA removed the jurisdiction of courts to hear habeas corpus petitions from ISA detainees. On April 25, 2001, Judge Augustine Paul of the Malaysian High Court (also presiding judge in Anwar Ibrahim's 1999 corruption trial) rejected the habeas corpus application of five of the activists detained under the ISA.  Malaysia's national human rights commission (known by its Malay acronym Suhakam) formally requested but has been denied access to the detainees.  Suhakam has also called for review of the ISA and other laws, followed by amendment or repeal of those that infringe human rights.  Those arrested are: Tian Chua, 37, Keadilan vice-president; Saari Sungib, 43, a member of the Keadilan's policy making council; Ezam Mohamad Noor, 34, Keadilan youth leader; N.

The Observatory is a joint program of the International Federation for Human Rights and the World Organization against Torture. The 28-page report, """"A Lawsuit against the Human Rights League, An Assault on All Rights Activists,"""" also accuses the government of Tunisia of waging an all-out campaign against human rights critics, including heavy-handed police actions to block meetings of human rights organizations, physical assaults on men and women activists, passport confiscations, and interruptions in phone service. Human Rights Watch and the Observatory urged the governments of France, and of all the European Union, to monitor the appeals court case against the league that opens April 30, and to pressure the Tunisian government to stop its harassment of human rights monitors.  """"The Tunisian government's methods are heavy-handed and completely unsubtle,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The outside world has to make it clear that this kind of repression is unacceptable.""""  The twenty-four year old LTDH elected an outspoken new steering committee last October. The new leaders were promptly assailed by authorities of the ruling party and then hit with a lawsuit. Although the suit is a private action filed by four LTDH members, it has given the authorities a handy weapon to use against the League's new leadership. Police displayed unusual zeal and alacrity in executing a court injunction against the steering committee, evicting it from the League's headquarters and then routinely preventing League members from gathering. The courts also replaced the steering committee with a temporary administrator and then proceeded to void the League's last elections. It is the challenge to the latter ruling that opens April 30 before the Tunis Court of Appeals.  The election of a more assertive leadership within the Human Rights League reflects a growing defiance among members of civil society toward government repression. This trend is apparent not only in the LTDH but also in the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), a two-year-old human rights group that has continued to speak out even though authorities have denied it legal recognition. In one of the state's more egregious responses to this renewed activism, CNLT co-founder and human rights lawyer Nejib Hosni was re-imprisoned in January on trumped-up charges.  France has recently increased its public criticism of Tunisian rights abuses and its diplomatic presence at political trials. Human Rights Watch and the Observatory urged France to continue the diplomatic pressure, and to use its leadership within the European Union on North African affairs to press for human rights progress.

The former British colony must decide how to deal with the Falun Gong spiritual meditation group, and how to respond to China's detention of Hong Kong-based academics. On May 8, President Jiang Zemin of China is due in Hong Kong to speak at a major business conference. Members of Falun Gong are expected to stage protests against Beijing's fierce crackdown on the group. If Mr. Jiang is embarrassed by the protests before an international audience, there is concern that Hong Kong will be subject to intense pressure from Beijing to ban Falun Gong, as China has done. Hong Kong officials have given mixed signals about Falun Gong's status. In February, Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, declared that Falun Gong had """"characteristics of an evil cult"""" and needed watching. He later appeared to back off. But Regina Ip, Hong Kong's security chief, branded Falun Gong a """"devious organization"""" responsible for """"heretical"""" views, echoing Beijing's sharp rhetoric. On April 26, Mr. Tung again attacked Falun Gong, saying its planned protests during Mr. Jiang's visit were unacceptable, against the interests of Hong Kong and """"a deliberate move to undermine"""" Hong Kong's relations with Beijing. Some in Hong Kong fear that Mr. Jiang's visit could be used as a pretext for enactment of an anti- subversion law, provided for by Article 23 of Hong Kong's Basic Law, to ban Falun Gong; alternatively, human rights activists fear the passage of an """"anti-cult"""" law like one on the mainland. When questioned about this, Bob Alcock, Hong Kong's solicitor general, stated flatly, """"there is no pressure to use Article 23 against Falun Gong."""" He also assured me that the group is """"legal in Hong Kong so long as they abide by Hong Kong's laws."""" Rather than threatening Falun Gong, Mr. Tung should make a clear public statement guaranteeing the right of Falun Gong members to protest peacefully and to operate in Hong Kong without official interference or restrictions. Among Hong Kong's academics, legislators and U.S. business executives, the detention of several China scholars on the mainland, including two based in Hong Kong, has set off alarm bells. Li Shaomin, a respected professor of business at City University of Hong Kong and a U.S. citizen, was picked up by the Chinese police when he went into Shenzhen on Feb. 25. The detention of Mr. Li, who also ran an Internet company in south China, remains unexplained. Equally worrying is the case of Xu Zerong, an associate research professor and former legal resident of Hong Kong, who went to Guangdong Province in August and was detained by Chinese state security officials. There is no information on where he is being held. If Hong Kong is totally powerless to protect its citizens from arbitrary arrest the minute they cross the border into the mainland, this poses a serious challenge to the idea of """"one country, two systems."""" Cross-border academic exchanges and business ties are vital if Hong Kong is to continue to prosper and to help drive China's development. Yet Hong Kong officials seemed strangely indifferent to the detentions. At a minimum, they should urgently press Beijing to clarify the legal status of the detained scholars. With China set to join the World Trade Organization, Hong Kong's role is more crucial than ever as an example of how free markets and civil liberties can thrive together. But Hong Kong risks serious erosion of its international position if its government fails to protect the rights of its citizens.

Nezzar, 64, is now retired from government and was in Paris to promote his memoirs.  """"France has cynically placed its relations with Algeria ahead of its international legal obligations,"""" said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch.

Nezzar headed the Algerian armed forces when it was given the leading role in fighting terrorism in the country.

The state must then make a preliminary inquiry into the facts of the allegations. France became a party to the Convention against Torture in 1986.

Human Rights Watch also welcomed the adoption of a critical resolution on Russia's conduct in Chechnya, and the extension of the mandate of the Special Representative on Iran.  The practice of forced disappearances plagues many parts of the world, including Algeria, Colombia, Iraq, and Sudan, as well as Chechnya in Russia. Although other treaties address certain aspects of forced disappearance, Human Rights Watch said a special treaty was needed to spell out the obligations of states to prevent the practice.  Members of the Commission agreed on April 23 to begin negotiations on a global accord against forced disappearances.  """"The possibility of a convention on disappearances is a significant victory for the human rights movement,"""" said Joanna Weschler, United Nations representative at Human Rights Watch. """"Years of work lie ahead, but we've made a very important first step.""""  The initiative to move ahead on the disappearances was led by France and several Latin American countries. The United States, India, Canada, and a handful of others tried to block the initiative, but were defeated.  Human Rights Watch voiced disappointment that the United States voted against a resolution addressing human rights violations in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, while European Union states abstained. Weschler agreed with the U.S. position that the resolution should have included reference to Palestinian abuses, but said the U.S. delegation refused to negotiate with the sponsors to improve the text in this regard.  Human Rights Watch said it deeply regretted the passage of the no-action motion on China that prevented the Commission from even discussing the human rights situation in that country, and it criticized the resolution on Rwanda, which praised """"progress"""" in restoring the rule of law, and effectively will end the work of the human rights Commission in Rwanda.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/04/25/human-rights-watch-letter-robert-b-zoellick-us-trade-representative","Human Rights Watch Letter to Robert B Zoellick US Trade Representative","Human Rights Watch Letter to Robert B. Zoellick, U.S. Trade Representative","","04/25/2001","The Honorable Robert B. Zoellick United States Trade Representative Office of The United States Trade Representative 600 17th Street, N.W. Washington, DC 20508   Dear Ambassador Zoellick:   On behalf of Human Rights Watch, I would like to share our view regarding the necessary link between trade and labor rights, and to suggest a way forward for the United States as it pursues free trade agreements bilaterally, regionally, and globally.   Our position begins with the recognition that the international flow of goods, capital, information and people has delivered wealth and opportunity to many parts of our planet, though many millions of people remain left behind. The further reduction of tariffs and subsidies in wealthy countries can help reduce poverty in a world where one in five people live on less than a dollar a day. What is more, the growing interdependence among developed and developing nations has itself helped to put issues such as child labor and freedom of association on the global agenda, giving those working for higher standards far greater leverage. Therefore, efforts to uphold labor rights should also advance the right of people everywhere to participate in the global economy.  At the same time, trade alone does not guarantee greater respect for labor and human rights. Increased trade with the United States has not diminished China's determination to snuff out all attempts by workers to organize independent trade unions, or ended egregious discrimination against women in Guatemalan maquiladoras, or freed children from hard labor in factories in South Asia. Such abuses can only be addressed if efforts to expand trade go hand in hand with efforts to promote basic worker and human rights.  Human Rights Watch believes strongly that the link between trade and rights is inherent and fundamental; it is not an effort to hold one agenda hostage to another. The link, after all, is very real to workers who stand to benefit from exports, but who sometimes find their wages artificially depressed by repression. It is real to consumers who do not want to be complicit in human rights violations by buying products made under abusive conditions or the threat of violence. The point of addressing these concerns in trade agreements is not to guarantee uniform wage levels or working conditions. It is to promote those universally recognized rights that allow workers the freedom to seek better wages and conditions. It is to ensure that governments enforce their labor laws. And it is to protect people from abuses such as forced and child labor, from which no nation should gain a competitive advantage. To do so is not a threat to globalization, but the minimum required for globalization to succeed.  The hard question is how to incorporate labor rights into trade agreements in a way that is effective and enforceable, without shutting down trade or benefiting the world's richest countries at the expense of the poorest.  Human Rights Watch believes that the idea of using monetary penalties as the primary tool for enforcing trade agreements, which you and others have explored, may offer a way forward. It is an alternative that the business community should be able to accept, and if implemented effectively, it may be the fairest alternative available. Clearly, workers who are abused and exploited are not likely to benefit from broad based trade sanctions that cost them their jobs. And when a government fails to meet its obligations, it is that government, not workers or businesses, which should pay the price.  We would be prepared to support such an approach, so long as it preserves the possibility of sanctions where governments simply refuse to pay monetary fines, and if it incorporates several principles, each based on a careful assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of past efforts to advance labor rights through trade.  1. Consistency  If the Administration pursues monetary penalties as an enforcement tool for labor rights, it should make clear it is committed to incorporating those rights into all future trade agreements. For example, if monetary penalties are advanced solely as a way of removing trade sanctions from the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, Human Rights Watch would be vigorously opposed. If they are advanced as a model for enforcing labor rights in future agreements, including the U.S.-Chile FTA and a Free Trade Area of the Americas, we believe they could contribute to a broad consensus on trade and labor.  2. Parity  Labor rights protections should be subject to the same dispute settlement and enforcement procedures and the same penalties available to other issues covered in trade agreements. For example, we could not support an approach that offers greater protection to intellectual property than it does to people - both as a matter of principle, and because we believe that the protection of core labor rights is as inherent to fair and open trade as the protection of copyrighted material.  Some may resist an approach that appears to weaken enforcement for the rights of businesses in order to strengthen enforcement of worker rights. But that need not be the case if fines are large enough and if non-payment could still result in the imposition of sanctions, as is the case in the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation.  3. Meaningful Definition of Rights  Future trade agreements should protect a broad range of internationally recognized labor rights, including all the labor principles and obligations enumerated in the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation, from freedom of association to non-discrimination in the workplace.  The requirement in the Jordan agreement that governments enforce existing domestic labor laws may be a good model for some future trade agreements, but not for all. For example, it would not be appropriate for a U.S.-Chile FTA because internationally recognized labor rights are not yet fully protected in Chile. Existing laws dating to the Pinochet era (some of which the government is attempting to change) fail to require reinstatement of workers fired for union activity, permit strikes only during the collective bargaining process, limit the right to bargain collectively above the level of the individual workplace, fail to protect the right of all workers to engage in collective bargaining and establish ineffective sanctions for labor law violations. When a trade agreement is based on the enforcement of domestic legislation, that legislation should meet international labor standards before the agreement is ratified, or within a pre-determined time-frame after ratification, with failure subject to penalty.  4. Enforceability  Clearly, any agreement prescribing fines for trade and labor violations would require the creation of a body to arbitrate disputes and impose the fines. Human Rights Watch believes it is vital that such a body have the independence to hear complaints from individuals, governments and NGO's, to initiate investigations on its own, to recommend remedies, and to impose penalties when governments fail to act.  The NAFTA experience demonstrates that it is unrealistic to expect governments to police each other when it comes to protection of labor rights. The NAFTA labor side agreement does provide for panels of arbitration which may impose penalties for certain labor rights violations. But the panels can only come into being when governments make a political decision to convene them. Partly as a result, of the 23 complaints filed under the NAFTA labor side agreement since 1994, few have been credibly investigated, and none have led to penalties or sanctions.  The potential of the NAFTA side agreement and of future efforts to protect labor rights in trade agreements can be realized only through an independent oversight body. That is the only way to take the enforcement of labor rights, and indeed, of other provisions of trade agreements, out of the realm of politics and into the realm of objective law enforcement.  5. Other Questions  One question about which any agreement prescribing monetary fines would need to be clear is how those fines would be used. When a government has the will to enforce its labor laws, but lacks the means, it may be appropriate to allocate fines to improve its labor law enforcement capacity. But when governments lack the will to meet their obligations, or deliberately violate fundamental rights, fines would be better paid to an outside monitoring body.  Another question is: What happens if a government chooses to pay a fine as a cost of doing business, while continuing to violate systematically the provisions of an agreement? Under such circumstances, the option of broader trade measures would need to be available as a last resort.  Finally, there may be times, particularly in smaller developing countries, when multinational corporations responsible for labor rights violations overwhelm a government's ability to enforce its labor laws (or, for that matter, its copyright laws). Under these circumstances neither fining the government nor sanctioning the country would be appropriate. One solution would be to give the independent oversight body the power to subpoena corporate officials, and to create a right of action in national courts against employers who systematically violate labor laws.  We recognize that ensuring the enforcement of labor rights provisions will be extraordinarily complex and difficult, especially for large, multilateral agreements such as the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. It remains to be seen whether existing institutions such as the WTO and the ILO can play a role or provide a model, or whether new arrangements will need to be created. But finding an appropriate mechanism will be critical, if the consensus for globalization is to be sustained, among business and labor, developed and developing countries.  Human Rights Watch is eager to work with you to explore these issues further, to find creative answers to the questions this effort has raised, and to find the common ground from which we can both lift lives and raise standards.

In February 2000, Hissene Habre was indicted on torture charges, but Senegal's highest court ruled last month that Habre could not stand trial because his alleged crimes were not committed in Senegal. Habre's victims immediately announced that they would seek Habre's extradition to Belgium, where a criminal investigation against Habre is also underway. The victims also filed a petition with the U.N. Committee against Torture, urging that Senegal be requested to prosecute or extradite Habre as required by the U.N. Torture Convention.  On April 7, however, Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade announced that he had asked Habre to leave Senegal. The victims feared that Habre would move to a country out of reach of an extradition request or a final U.N. ruling and asked the Committee to issue an interim ruling to preserve their ability to bring him to justice. The Committee responded by asking Senegal """"not to expel Mr. Hissene Habreand to take all necessary measures to prevent Mr. Hissene Habre from leaving Senegalese territory except pursuant to an extradition procedure.""""  """"This ruling is a great victory for Habre's thousands of victims,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, the lawyer who represents the victims before the U.N. Committee against Torture. """"Hissene Habre is not just an undesirable to be expelled, he is an accused torturer who should be brought to justice. The day when Habre will have to answer for his crimes is fast approaching.""""  The United Nations Committee against Torture is composed of 10 experts elected by the 123 states which have ratified the Torture Convention. States usually comply with its decisions, and Senegal is expected to do so. President Wade has in the past said that he had no objection to a trial of Habre in another country.  """"This decision is based on the principle that Senegal is obliged to prosecute or extradite alleged torturers like Hissene Habre,"""" said the Senegalese lawyer, Sidiki Kaba, who is the president of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH).  """"I don't think Senegal will ignore this ruling and let Habre escape justice,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO).  The Chadian victims at the center of the case were jubilant. """"The United Nations has heard our pleas,"""" said Suleymane Guengueng, 49, who almost died of dengue fever during two years of mistreatment in Chadian prisons, before helping to found the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP). """"If Senegal will not put Habre on trial for his atrocities, it must at least hand him over to a country that will.""""  The petition to the United Nations was brought by the same seven Chadian victims who had filed the criminal case in Dakar. In January 2000, the victims provided a Senegalese court with details of 97 cases of political killings, 142 cases of torture and 100 cases of """"disappearance"""" committed by Habre's forces during his 1982-1990 rule.  In February 2000, Senegalese Judge Demba Kandji indicted Habre on torture charges, and placed him under house arrest. On July 4, 2000, the Court of Appeals dismissed the charges against Habre, ruling that Senegal had not enacted legislation to implement the Torture Convention and therefore had no jurisdiction to pursue crimes not committed in Senegal. That decision was upheld on March 20 by the Cour de Cassation, Senegal's court of final appeals.  Habre, now 58, took power in Chad in 1982. Habre's one-party regime, supported by the United States and France, was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1984), Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habre was deposed in December 1990 and has lived in Senegal since. A truth commission accused Habre's government of 40,000 murders and systematic torture.  The victims' case is also backed by the Chadian Association for Human Rights (ATPDH), the Chadian League for Human Rights (LTDH), the National Organization for Human Rights (Senegal), the London-based Interights, and the French organization Agir Ensemble pour les droits de l'homme.

The four men, who were arrested after protesting coercion and corruption involved in resettling thousands of fellow farmers, may go on trial as early as next week. The appeal comes one day after the U.N. Commission on Human Rights refused to criticize China's human rights practices. Human Rights Watch and Probe International called on diplomats in Beijing and international banks involved in financing the dam to urge the Chinese government to release the men and conduct a full, impartial, and transparent investigation into their charges of official malfeasance. """"Governments and banks around the world have helped finance the Three Gorges Dam,"""" said Patricia Adams of Probe International. """"They should speak up to ensure justice for whistle-blowers like the men from Gaoyang and for the people they represent."""" The four farmers, He Kechang, Rang Chongxin, Jiang Qingshan, and Wen Dingchun, are among thousands of residents of Gaoyang township, Yunyang county, Chongqing municipality due to be resettled, as the county is in the middle of what will become the dam's reservoir area. Three of the men were arrested in mid-March after they had traveled to Beijing with petitions detailing systematic embezzlement of funds set aside for resettlement. The fourth was arrested in Gaoyang about the same time. All are reportedly being held in the Yunyang County police lock-up in Chongqing. They are expected to be tried at the end of April on charges of disturbing public order, leaking state secrets, and """"maintaining illicit relations with a foreign country."""" The last charge is apparently a reference to their contacts with the international press in Hong Kong. In early March, according to sources in the area, eight representatives of the thousands of soon-to-be resettled residents of Gaoyang had decided to travel to Beijing to speak out against misuse of resettlement funds by local officials. The officials had reportedly inflated the number of people to be resettled as well as the amount of land needed, thereby collecting more money from the central government. They also paid less than the amount promised to those forced to move, and complaints had filtered back to those still in Yunyang. The local police got wind of the proposed protest and on March 8, arrested Wen Dingchun, one of the would-be petitioners in Gaoyang. Four others reportedly fled. He Kechang led the remaining two to Beijing. The Yunyang county police tracked them down there, and on March 12, they were taken into custody and escorted back to Yunyang. All four - the three arrested in Beijing and Wen Dingchun - have been in the police lock-up since. He Kechang has reportedly smuggled a message out that he has been ill-treated, but verification of the condition of the men has been impossible. After the men left for Beijing, the police searched their homes. In He Kechang's home, they found copies of interviews he had given to the Hong Kong press and a letter to Jasper Becker, a well-known reporter from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post. He Kechang had earlier telephoned the paper to report Wen Dingchun's arrest. """"This case bears some resemblance to the recent arrests of Chinese-born academics,"""" said Sidney Jones of Human Rights Watch. """"In both cases, the people detained apparently had information on local conditions that they were trying to get out to a wider audience, the academics through scholarly publications, the farmers through petitions."""" Jones noted that corruption is hardly a state secret in China, but in the absence of freedom of expression or independent courts, ordinary citizens run a huge risk in revealing abuses by local authorities - including being charged with leaking state secrets. Regulations approved by China's State Council in February were designed to reduce the possibility of corruption and coercion in connection with resettlement of people living around the Three Gorges Dam. At the time the regulations were issued, a leading Chinese expert on resettlement, sociologist Wei Yi, warned that the only way to ease corruption was to allow more public oversight and press scrutiny.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Resolution on Chechnya Welcomed","","04/19/2001","Human Rights Watch welcomed a resolution adopted by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights expressing grave concern about human rights violations in Chechnya. Introduced by the European Union and cosponsored by 16 countries, the resolution strongly condemns the use of disproportionate force and serious human rights violations by Russia's forces and calls on Russia to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors undertake credible and exhaustive criminal investigations of all violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. It also raises concern about the pattern of forced disappearances, torture and summary executions perpetrated by Russia's forces in Chechnya.  But the resolution stops short of calling for an international commission of inquiry, a body for which Human Rights Watch and other groups had advocated.  """"The Commission basically did the right thing today,"""" said Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's U.N. representative. """"But the shabby investigations into abuse launched by Russia shows that only an international commission can establish the truth. Even if the Russian authorities refused to cooperate with it, they would at least feel external pressure and clean up their act somewhat as a result.""""  At its last session, in April 2000, the Commission adopted a similar resolution, calling for a national commission of inquiry to investigate violations-the first time a Commission resolution censured a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. But throughout the past year Russia willfully refused to comply with the resolution's requirements, and its forces continued to perpetrate atrocities with impunity.  """"Today's vote sends a message that no matter how powerful a state is, it won't get a pass on human rights after ignoring the U.N.,"""" said Ms. Weschler.

High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in providing protection for twenty-four indigenous minority asylum seekers from Vietnam. Eighteen refugees have already left for the United States and the remaining six have been approved for departure in the coming days. """"Cambodia did a good job of handling this politically sensitive case,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"Thanks to the cooperation of Prime Minister Hun Sen and other officials, the UNHCR was able to meet with the refugees and see them to safety.""""  The arrival of indigenous Jarai, Rhade, and Mnong (Pnong) people in Cambodia in recent weeks followed widespread rural unrest and a government crackdown in the Vietnamese Central Highland provinces of Gia Lai, Dak Lak and Kon Tum. In early February, thousands of indigenous minority people in those provinces had participated in demonstrations calling for land rights.  In response, Vietnamese police and military were sent into the region, arresting at least twenty indigenous minority leaders, cutting off telephone communications, and banning diplomats, international organizations, and foreign media from visiting the area. The only outside visit allowed was a government-sponsored press tour to Gia Lai and Dak Lak provinces on March 16-17.  Fearing arrest, a number of indigenous people from the Central Highlands fled to northeastern Cambodia in early March. In mid-March, Cambodian police arrested twenty-four of them in Mondolkiri province, Cambodia. The highlanders were transported to Phnom Penh, where they were detained at the municipal Gendarmerie headquarters for several weeks. On March 31, Cambodian officials agreed to allow UNHCR representatives to interview the detainees.  Persons in Vietnam who are involved in non-violent political activity deemed by the authorities to be """"anti-government"""" are subject to arrest and prosecution. Vietnamese criminal law provides for harsh punishment for a wide variety of offenses, including vaguely defined political crimes such as undermining peace or subverting state unity.  The courts in Vietnam are not independent, but under the control of the ruling Communist party. """"In Vietnam, the peaceful expression of dissent is often treated as a criminal act, even though such expression is protected under international human rights law,"""" said Jones """"We are glad to see Cambodia living up to its international obligations.""""  Human Rights Watch expressed concern, however, about the behavior of the Vietnamese Red Cross, which is a member of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. Prior to the refugees' departure from Phnom Penh, a delegation from the Vietnamese Red Cross met with the group and showed them videotapes of their families in Vietnam, pleading for them to return.  """"This is completely inappropriate behavior on the part of the Red Cross. Showing the videotapes was a form of coercion and naturally would lead those in flight to worry that their family members might be at risk,"""" said Jones.  Cambodia is a State party to the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/04/18/rape-crisis-us-prisons","Rape Crisis in US Prisons","Rape Crisis in U.S. Prisons","First-Ever National Survey Finds Widespread Abuse, Official Indifference","04/18/2001","A ground-breaking new report by Human Rights Watch, No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons, charges that state authorities are responsible for widespread prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse in U.S. men's prisons. """"Rape is in no way an inevitable consequence of incarceration,"""" said Joanne Mariner, deputy director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch, and author of the report. """"But it is a predictable one if prison and prosecutorial authorities do little to prevent and punish it."""" Human Rights Watch warned that by failing to implement reasonable measures to prevent and punish rape—and, indeed, in many cases, taking actions that make sexual victimization likely—state authorities permit this physically and psychologically devastating abuse to occur. The group's findings are based on correspondence with more than 200 prisoners spread among thirty-four states, inmate interviews, and a comprehensive survey of state correctional authorities. Certain prisoners are targeted for sexual exploitation the moment they enter a penal facility: their age, looks, sexual orientation, and other characteristics mark them as candidates for abuse. Human Rights Watch's research revealed a broad range of factors that correlate with increased vulnerability to rape. These include youth, small size, and physical weakness; being white, gay, or a first offender; possessing """"feminine"""" characteristics such as long hair or a high voice; being unassertive, unaggressive, shy, intellectual, not street-smart, or """"passive""""; or having been convicted of a sexual offense against a minor. Sexual Slavery In the most extreme cases, Human Rights Watch found that prisoners unable to escape a situation of sexual abuse may find themselves the """"slaves"""" of their rapists. Forced to satisfy another man's sexual appetites whenever he demands, they may also be responsible for washing his clothes, massaging his back, cooking his food, cleaning his cell, and a range of other chores. They are frequently """"rented out"""" for sex, sold, or even auctioned off to other inmates. No conclusive national data exist regarding the prevalence of prisoner-on-prisoner rape in the United States. But the most recent statistical survey, published in the Prison Journal, showed that 21 percent of inmates in seven Midwestern prisons had experienced at least one episode of pressured or forced sex since being incarcerated, and at least 7 percent had been raped in their facility. And an internal departmental survey of corrections officers in one southern state found that line officers ?those charged with the direct supervision of inmates ?estimated that roughly one-fifth of all prisoners were being coerced into participation in inmate-on-inmate sex. """"These rapes are unimaginably vicious and brutal,"""" said Mariner. """"Gang assaults are not uncommon, and victims may be left beaten, bloody and, in the most extreme cases, dead."""" One of the most tragic and violent cases the report documents is that of Randy Payne, a twenty-three-year-old incarcerated in Texas. Within a week of entering prison, Payne was attacked by a group of some twenty inmates. The inmates demanded sex and money, but Payne refused. He was beaten for almost two hours, and died of head injuries a few days later. Victims of rape often suffer extreme psychological stress, a condition identified as """"rape trauma syndrome."""" Many inmate victims with whom Human Rights Watch has been in contact have reported nightmares, deep depression, shame, loss of self-esteem, self-hatred, and considering or attempting suicide. """"Deliberate Indifference"""" Correctional authorities generally deny that prisoner-on-prisoner rape is a serious problem. Human Rights Watch surveyed correctional authorities in all 50 states on the prevalence of rape and sexual abuse. In that multi-year survey, not one state reported abuse rates even faintly approaching those found by academic researchers. For example, New Mexico prison officials said, regarding """"the ‘problem' of male inmate-on-inmate rape and sexual abuse"""" (internal quotation marks are theirs), that they had """"no recorded incidents over the past few years."""" Nearly half of all states do not even compile separate statistics on sexual assault. The authorities' reluctance to acknowledge the problem of prisoner-on-prisoner rape is reflected not only in misleading official statistics, but also in a glaringly inadequate response to incidents of rape. """"U.S. state prisons have failed to take even obvious, basic steps necessary to tackle prison rape,"""" Mariner said. """"This deliberate indifference has had tragic consequences."""" A central problem is the deficient ?and, in many instances, callous and irresponsible ?response of correctional staff to complaints of rape. When an inmate informs an officer he has been threatened with rape or, worse, actually assaulted, it is crucial that his complaint be investigated and that he be protected from further abuse. Yet Human Rights Watch found that correctional staff frequently ignore or even react hostilely to inmates' complaints of rape. """"Another important contributing factor to the prison rape crisis is the failure of the criminal justice system to address these crimes,"""" said Mariner. """"Perpetrators of prison rape rarely face criminal charges, even when rape is accompanied by extreme physical violence."""" The case of M.R., a Texas inmate, is illustrative. M.R. was violently raped and beaten several times over a period of several months by the same prisoner. Fearful for his life, he reported the abuse to the prison authorities, but found no protection. In fact one investigator dismissed the problem as a """"lovers' quarrel."""" Finally one day the rapist showed up in M.R.'s housing area and attacked M.R. again. The rapist hit M.R. so hard with a combination lock that when M.R. regained consciousness he could read the word """"Master"""" ?the lockmaker ?on his forehead. In all, during the rape, M.R. suffered a broken neck, jaw, left collarbone, and finger; a dislocated left shoulder; two major concussions, and lacerations to his scalp that caused bleeding on the brain. Notwithstanding the extreme violence of the attack, and despite M.R.'s best efforts to press charges, the rapist was never criminally prosecuted. Another devastating consequence of prisoner-on-prisoner rape discussed in the report is the transmission of the HIV virus. Several prisoners with whom Human Rights Watch is in contact believe that they have contracted HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, through forced sexual intercourse in prison. The book-length Human Rights Watch report explains: why and how prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse occurs; who commits it and who falls victim to it; prison rape's long-term effects, both physical and psychological; how are prison authorities coping with it; and what reforms must be instituted to better prevent rape from occurring. """"Prison rape is part of the mythology of prison life. But in reality, it is devastating human rights abuse that can and should be prevented,"""" said Mariner. The report includes extensive recommendations to federal and state authorities, urging them to step up their efforts to address this gross violation of human dignity.","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Health, HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis"

While welcoming the legislation, which passed the Senate yesterday, Human Rights Watch warned that press freedom in Chile is still narrowly circumscribed. The new law is good news for the people still facing defamation charges under the State Security Law,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"It bodes well for freedom of the press and Chilean democracy. But more needs to be done to bring Chile's speech laws into line with international standards.""""  The so-called Press Law that just passed repeals article 6(b) of the State Security Law, a provision that criminalized """"contempt of authority."""" The repealed provision mandated prison sentences for those who """"insult"""" public authorities such as the president, commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, members of Congress and the Supreme Court.  More than thirty journalists, politicians and ordinary citizens have been prosecuted under this statute since Chile returned to democratic rule in 1990, the most recent cases being brought in February 2001. At least eight people are currently charged or face possible charges under article 6(b).  Also repealed is article 16 of the State Security Law, which was used in 1999 to confiscate the entire stock of The Black Book of Chilean Justice, an expose of judicial corruption, on the day of its launch.  Among other notable improvements of the new Press Law is the fact that journalists will be protected from any obligation to reveal their sources, and courts will no longer be allowed to gag press reporting of controversial criminal cases. All prosecutions for press offenses will be conducted solely by ordinary civilian courts, ending the powers of military tribunals to try journalists for sedition.  First introduced by the Aylwin government in 1993, the Press Law was the object of numerous revisions during its eight years in congressional debate. It was finally approved by the lower house on April 10, and yesterday by the Senate. [President Lagos is expected to sign the bill next week.]  Yet restrictions on freedom of expression still pervade Chilean legislation. Existing laws offer ample avenues for officials to ban publications and prosecute critics for defamation.  Articles 263, 264, and 265 of the ordinary criminal code, for example, still permit prosecutions for defamation of the President, members of Congress, judges, and ministers of state. In a report published in March, Progress Stalled: Setbacks in Freedom of Expression Reform, Human Rights Watch urged the government to abolish these provisions, as well as those in the State Security Law.  Other objectionable provisions include those that allow judges to confiscate publications. One such provision is Article 30 of the State Security Law, which allows judges to impound publications used to commit libel against a state authority.  The repeal of contempt of authority laws has been a long-standing recommendation of the Organization of American States' Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Expression and of press organizations, including the Inter-American Press Association (IAPA). In response to appeals from Human Rights Watch and the IAPA, President Lagos pledged last month to introduce a bill to eliminate the questioned provisions of the criminal codeduring the current year.  The government has recently said it intends to re-examine Chile's strict privacy laws and aims to replace criminal prosecutions for libel with civil proceedings and fines.  In a separate initiative, Congress is in the final stages of approving another long-delayed reform which will eliminate film censorship from the constitution. In a landmark case in February, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights found that Chile's censorship of the film The Last Temptation of Christ violated the American Convention on Human Rights. The court called on Chile to amend its domestic law to eliminate prior censorship.  """"Chile is well on the way to erradicating the vestiges of its authoritarian past, particularly those that enfringe on free expression,"""" said Vivanco. """"We urge Chile's legislators not to stop here, but rather to eliminate all the other restrictive laws that keep Chileans from enjoying full rights to freedom of speech.""""","Americas, Chile","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Commission on Human Rights could lead to even further deterioration of human rights in China, Human Rights Watch warned today. """"With this vote, Beijing strengthens its hand,"""" said Joanna Weschler, Human Rights Watch's U.N. representative. """"It can continue and intensify its crackdown on basic freedoms, without any consequences internationally. It's clear that technical assistance from the U.N. and bilateral dialogues on human rights are insufficient to address China's massive human rights problems."""" The U.N. Commission in Geneva, voting on a """"no action"""" procedural motion by China, decided by a vote of 23 for, 17 against, with 12 abstentions and one government absent, not to debate or vote on a resolution sponsored by the U.S. Last April, in a similar move, a no-action motion on a U.S.-sponsored resolution was adopted 22 for, 18 against, 12 abstentions, and 1 absent. While supporting the U.S. decision to put forward the resolution, Human Rights Watch expressed disappointment at """"the Commission's dismal failure to take action on China."""" """"Key governments seem unwilling to put pressure on Beijing, and to back up their rhetoric about human rights with action,"""" said Weschler. Over the past year, China has enacted new regulations on access to the Internet, detained at least four foreign-based scholars with no explanation, waged a fierce campaign against the Falun Gong, and continued a crackdown on unofficial religious activity and the repression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang. It took no action to abolish re-education through labor, a system of administrative punishment repeatedly condemned by the U.N. as arbitrary, or to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. China did ratify the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on February 28, 2001, but took a reservation on key provisions guaranteeing workers' rights.

Security Council Sanctions Committees on Liberia and Sierra Leone Regarding Sanctions and Arms Shipments","","04/18/2001","H.E. Mr. Kishore Mahbubani Chair, Security Council Sanctions Committee on Liberia Permanent Mission of Singapore   H.E. Mr. Anwarul Karim Chowdhury Chair, Security Council Sanctions Committee on Sierra Leone Permanent Mission of Bangladesh   Your Excellencies:   We very much welcome the heightened attention the Security Council has given to U.N. sanctions against the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) in Sierra Leone since that country slipped back into war in May of last year. The publication in December 2000 of the excellent report of the Panel of Experts on Sierra Leone is an especially notable contribution. We also welcome the recent tightening of sanctions on Liberia (all but the arms embargo postponed until May, pending review) and the formation of an experts panel to monitor compliance with these sanctions and investigate alleged violations. We are pleased that the Liberia panel will be able to draw extensively on the expertise of the Sierra Leone panel, whose mandate ended in December 2000 and four of whose former members have joined the Liberia panel. We understand that the Liberia experts panel has convened in New York for two weeks of meetings.   In the interest of advancing this work, we wish to draw your attention to unconfirmed but troubling allegations, circulated within the U.N. system, that the RUF continues to receive shipments of weapons via Liberia in violation of Security Council sanctions. These allegations were contained in a March 4, 2001, situation report sent to U.N. headquarters in Freetown by UNAMSIL personnel stationed near RUF-controlled areas in eastern Sierra Leone. The UNAMSIL report notes that, according to reports from local sources, helicopters carrying food, weapons, and ammunition were at that time making three to four deliveries per week from the interior of Liberia to Foya, near the Sierra Leone border, where the cargo was allegedly offloaded and delivered on vehicles to Koindu inside the rebel stronghold of Kailahun in Sierra Leone. The report also indicated that civilians witnessed seven truckloads of ammunition being transported to Pendembu, some 25 miles from Koindu, around February 28.   While we cannot verify any link, we are concerned that on March 9, shortly after these alleged arms shipments were said to have been delivered, hundreds of RUF fighters were involved in a major attack at Nongowa and other locations within the Parrot's Beak region of Guinea. We understand that RUF soldiers killed in the Nongowa attack were found to have been carrying what appeared to be brand-new weapons.   A further UNAMSIL communication, dated March 27, suggested that the various shipments described above might have been UNHCR flights and convoys delivering humanitarian supplies to the Guinea border region. We find this explanation unsatisfactory, given that the ultimate destinations noted are deep in RUF-held territory. Furthermore, UNHCR has indicated to Human Rights Watch that it had no reason to be near those areas. Human Rights Watch remains gravely concerned about the human rights situation faced by Sierra Leone's civilians, who continue to suffer unspeakable brutality at the hands of the RUF, including upon their return from refugee camps in Guinea. In addition, we are deeply troubled by the growing humanitarian tragedy in Guinea itself, where Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees - already victimized by horrific violence in their own countries - have been further terrorized by indiscriminate attacks and forced to flee once more. Liberia too has seen outbreaks of fighting that threaten civilian populations. Fighting in all three countries, largely concentrated in and around the areas bordering the RUF strongholds of Kono and Kailahun, and the potential for still greater bloodshed highlights the importance of the strict implementation of U.N. arms embargoes imposed on human rights abusers.   We strongly believe that the sanctions imposed on the RUF and Liberia require vigorous monitoring and enforcement to protect civilians from further atrocities and to hold the abusers, as well as their international accomplices, accountable for their actions. We therefore call on the Sierra Leone sanctions committee, the Liberia sanctions committee, and the Liberia experts panel to work together to promptly investigate these reports and make public their findings at the earliest opportunity.   Thank you for your attention to this important matter.   Sincerely,   Joost R. Hiltermann Executive Director Arms Division   Joanna Weschler U.N.

Radovan Karadzic, Bosnia's most notorious war crimes suspect and the mastermind behind ethnic cleansing during the war, and Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb military commander, were charged with genocide also in connection with the Srebrenica massacre.   In Srebrenica many thousands of men were detained by Bosnian Serb troops under General Mladic's command. Eyewitnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch described the horror as hundreds of men were lined up in front of mass graves and shot. More than 7,000 remain missing and are believed to have been killed or executed.   Karadzic and Mladic remain at large and are believed to be living in Bosnia. Human Rights Watch welcomed today's acknowledgment by the Bush administration that Karadzic and Mladic bear ultimate responsibility for Srebrenica and that they must be brought to justice.   """"The arrest of Obrenovic is a positive step, but Karadzic and Mladic must also be arrested for the atrocities committed in Srebrenica,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Until they are in custody in The Hague, the thousands of victims of wartime atrocities in Bosnia have no hope of real justice.""""   According to sources in Brussels and Washington, D.C., U.S. troops participated in the arrest of Obrenovic. Human Rights Watch welcomed the involvement of U.S. troops and expressed hope that this would be the beginning of a more assertive role by U.S. troops in arrest efforts in Bosnia. """"We sincerely hope that the Bush administration will do what the Clinton administration did not - enlist U.S. troops in Bosnia to help apprehend the worst war crimes indictees and transfer them to The Hague,"""" added Cartner.

""""The petition appealing the arrest of three scholars of Chinese ancestry marks a major initiative by the international China studies community -- one without recent precedent in the scale of the international response and outpouring of concern for the fate of our colleagues,"""" said Mark Selden, Professor of Sociology and History, Binghamton University.  The open letter to Chinese President Jiang Zemin was released at a press conference in New York co-sponsored by the New York Academy of Sciences Committee for Human Rights, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Sociological Association, and the Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch.  The letter's signatories, all members of the international academic community working in the field of China studies, called the detentions """"a gross violation of China's Criminal Procedure Law,"""" as well as international human rights law.  """"What unites all of the signatories is a common hope our detained colleagues will be allowed home to the safety of their families and back to their offices to pursue their legitimate scholarly work - as we ourselves are free to do,"""" said Robin Munro, research fellow at London University and one of the signatories.  The three detained scholars are:  Prof. Li Shaomin, a U.S. citizen teaching business at the City University of Hong Kong, Dr. Gao Zhan, a permanent resident of the U.S. and a research scholar based at American University in Washington, D.C., and Dr. Xu Zerong, who holds a Ph.D. from Oxford University and is an associate research professor at the Guangdong Provincial Academy of Social Sciences.In the letter, the scholars expressed their concern about the vague reasons for the detention of their colleagues, and called on President Jiang to demonstrate China's commitment to human rights and academic freedom by either immediately releasing the scholars or by promptly affording them the opportunity to defend themselves in a court of law with international standards of due process.

Professor Li Shaomin, who teaches business at the City University of Hong Kong, was detained on February 25 during a visit to Shenzhen. At this writing, the authorities have not stated why he was detained, or where he is being held. Prof. Li, a U.S. citizen for the last six years, is a much-published sociologist whose work focuses on the issues involved in China's privatizing economy and on the impact and use of advertising in China. Li Shaomin received his Ph.D. in sociology from Princeton University in 1988, and was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. He also worked closely with several major western corporations interested in doing business in China. He had frequently traveled between Hong Kong and Mainland China in the past.  We are also deeply concerned about the arrest of Dr. Gao Zhan, a research scholar based at American University in Washington, D.C., who was detained in China on February 11 and was arrested for """"spying"""" for unspecified """"overseas intelligence agencies."""" Although Chinese authorities have stated that she has confessed to these charges, to date the Chinese Government has not provided any confirming evidence. Her husband, Xue Donghua, who was also detained without charge and later released, has strenuously denied the charges. Moreover, in contravention of China's clear obligations under the Sino-US consular agreement providing for prompt access to detained nationals by their consular representatives, the couple's five-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, was detained and separated from his parents for 26 days without any notification to U.S. authorities. Dr. Gao's academic work focuses on Chinese students, especially women, who return to China after a period abroad. She has been held in total isolation and denied access to counsel. Finally, we are seriously concerned for the safety and well-being of Dr. Xu Zerong, who was detained by PRC State Security officers in Guangzhou last October. Dr. Xu, who holds a Ph.D. from Oxford University, is an associate research professor at the Guangdong Provincial Academy of Social Sciences and an affiliated professor at Zhongshan University. Before assuming these posts, he was a legal resident of Hong Kong, where he was active in publishing the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly. It is not known what charges, if any, Dr. Xu may currently be facing. His family has reportedly neither been allowed to meet with him nor been informed as to where he is being held, and he has not been permitted to speak with a lawyer. The extended solitary confinement of all three of these scholars, on the pretext that they are detained under what was intended to be the milder sanction of """"supervised residence,"""" is a gross violation of China's Criminal Procedure Law. This is recognized by Article 98 of the Ministry of Public Security's 1998 Rules on Procedures for the Handling of Criminal Cases by Public Security Organs.  Moreover, when China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in October 1998, it made a commitment to strive to provide all individuals the right to be free from """"arbitrary arrest or detention,"""" and to guarantee all the """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds."""" In addition, Article 47 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China protects the freedom to engage in scientific research and artistic endeavor. Furthermore, the International Covenant on Social, Economic and Cultural Rights, which China has ratified, stipulates (in Article 15): """"The States Parties to the present Covenant undertake to respect the freedom indispensable for scientific research and creative activity."""" The ongoing detention of Li Shaomin, Gao Zhan and Xu Zerong violates the above-listed fundamental rights. Their detention will likely deter other academics, especially but by no means only those of Chinese nationality, from freely pursuing their research in and about China for fear of suffering the same treatment.  Scholarly relations have been in the forefront of the process of improving relations between China and the rest of the world. Tens of thousands of scholars have participated in both directions and have contributed significantly to China's modernization and the enhancement of understanding between China and other nations. It is therefore with dismay that we view the deterioration of the climate for academic exchange and research, as demonstrated by the detention of scholars who have returned to China merely to conduct research and engage in other normal scholarly activities. A vibrant civil society and the free exchange of views and ideas are essential for any healthy society and especially for a country preparing to embrace the global economy. We therefore respectfully urge your government to indicate its commitment to protecting and promoting academic freedom in China, and to upholding the vital role of scholarly exchange in building international understanding and trust, either by immediately releasing the three detained social scientists, or by promptly affording them the genuine opportunity to defend themselves against formal charges in a court of law following international standards of due process. (These include, of course, unimpeded access by the accused to legal counsel of their choice, and also - where relevant - regular access to and by their consular representatives.) Thank you for your consideration of these urgent and important matters. We look forward to receiving your reply.","Asia, China and Tibet","Free Speech"

Sadly, such spectacles are not far from reality at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is holding its annual meeting in Geneva. It features the sordid ritual of the world's despots and tyrants scrambling to join a commission that is tasked with investigating and condemning the world's despots and tyrants. Although not a judicial body, the commission is the UN membership's chief human rights organ. It is composed of 53 governments, chosen for three-year terms. According to the usual UN procedure, each regional bloc of governments selects an assigned number of commission members. There are no minimum criteria for membership. Dictatorships are as free as democracies to serve. The latest batch of new members illustrates how poorly this system works. They include such dubious paragons of human rights virtue as Algeria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Vietnam. Needless to say, such governments do not seek membership out of a commitment to promote human rights abroad or to improve their own abysmal human rights records. Rather they join the commission to protect themselves from criticism and to undermine its work. This sabotage takes two forms. First, abusive governments can usually be counted on to reject efforts to criticize other abusive governments. For example, each year when China lobbies against condemnation of its repressive rule it can count on a sympathetic ear from the many other abusive countries on the commission. With the cards thus stacked, action against even the worst human rights abusers is difficult to secure. That, in part, is why, even in the aftermath of the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, the commission never mustered enough votes to condemn China, and why the Iraqi dicta-tor Saddam Hussein could gas and execute tens of thousands of Kurds with impunity before his ill-fated invasion of Kuwait. Second, abusive governments have become quite creative in proposing """"reforms"""" that would impair the commission's ability to generate pressure on behalf of human rights. A typical proposal put forward by Cuba, a longtime commission member, targeted the special rapporteurs and working groups that the commission deploys to investigate and report on serious human rights abuses. Backed by a bevy of repressive allies, Cuba proposed precluding these investigators from reporting their findings publicly until they have been delivered to the annual session of the commis-sion - a requirement that, if adopted, would have meant lengthy delays and vastly decreased effectiveness. The abusive governments that flock to the commission frequently refuse to cooperate with UN investigators. Cuba refused for years to allow a visit by the rapporteur assigned to monitor its human rights record. China and Algeria are stonewalling on requests for visits by the rapporteur on torture. Russia has blocked visits to Chechnya by the rapporteurs on torture and extrajudicial execution. The most egregious case was Sudan. When a rapporteur denounced its violations of religious freedom, it called him an """"enemy of Islam."""" Yet Sudan was later rewarded for this rejectionism with the deputy chairmanship of the commission. The good news behind this rallying of the repressive is that the United Nations' human rights machinery matters. Governments go to great lengths to avoid UN exposure or condemnation of their atrocities. The bad news is that a mafia-like code of silence reins in Geneva, with one abuser covering for another, knowing that, when necessary, the favor will be reciprocated. It would be a mistake to attribute responsibility for this sorry state of affairs to the United Nations itself. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson, have spoken out with unprecedented candor on behalf of human rights. Rather, blame lies with the member states, the governments that allow this farce to continue year after year. The United States and its closest Western allies are hardly happy about this state of affairs. They do their best to work around it. But they have yet to tackle the problem head-on. It is time for a rule requiring any prospective commission member to demonstrate a minimum of respect for human rights. In addition, all candidate governments should be required to extend a standing invitation to the commission's various investigators, allowing them to visit their countries whenever they want. Such reforms would require some degree of compliance with the rights that the commission upholds and would end the travesty of governments using their commission membership to block the very work that they claim to support.","Global","International Justice, United Nations"

I n a background memorandum released ahead of the U.N. Human Rights Commission vote on Chechnya, Human Rights Watch assesses the Russian government's investigation and concludes that it could not be viewed as either thorough or credible. Human Rights Watch found that:  As a result of an inadequate identification procedure for the bodies, the premature burial of thirty-four unidentified bodies; the failure to record and preserve important evidence; and inadequate autopsies of at least two-thirds of the bodies; important evidence that could have led to identification of the perpetrators has been lost.  """"The Russian authorities have made no serious efforts to investigate and prosecute other atrocities committed by Russian forces during the Chechen conflict. What would make anyone think it will be different with the investigation of this mass grave?"""" said Cartner. """"Given the government's failure to preserve crucial evidence and its haste to bury unidentified bodies, an international commission of inquiry is the only way we will ever discover the truth about the bodies found in the mass grave.""""  The mass grave was discovered on February 24, in the village of Dachny (also called Zdorovye), located less than a kilometer from the main Russian military base in Chechnya. Fifty-one bodies were discovered at the site.

Most were in civilian clothing, some were blindfolded, and many had their hands or feet bound, and most bore unmistakable signs of torture.

Federal and local authorities denied responsibility for the grave site and instead blamed the deaths on Chechen forces and criminal gangs. However, the area where the mass grave was found has been under Russian military control since December 1999, long before the vast majority of the bodies were deposited there.  The Russian government's investigation into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of those found at the site has been wholly inadequate. Russian authorities failed to provide adequate time or information for identifying the bodies, so that the victims' relatives often did not know that they could view the bodies or learned about the identification process only through word of mouth. Russian authorities also conducted the investigation in a manner that did not preserve potentially crucial evidence that might have led to the identification of those responsible for the torture and execution-style killings of the more than fifty persons found at the site. The investigation is further evidence of the Russian government's refusal to take meaningful steps to identify the perpetrators of serious human rights abuses by its forces and hold them accountable.  Dachny was not the first site of unmarked graves to be found in Chechnya, although it is the largest found to date. In March, Human Rights Watch issued a report, """"The 'Dirty War' in Chechnya: Forced Disappearances, Torture, and Summary Executions,"""" documenting eight mass graves and eight other makeshift burial sites where corpses of the """"disappeared"""" and others had been found. Most of the bodies found in those graves were last seen in the custody of Russian federal forces, and most bore unmistakable signs of torture. Injuries commonly found on the bodies included broken limbs, scalped body parts, severed fingertips, and knife and gunshot wounds.  Human Rights Watch researchers interviewed nineteen individuals who searched for """"disappeared"""" relatives at the identification site or at Dachny village. This background memorandum is based on those interviews, on information from the Moscow-based Memorial Human Rights Center, and on photographs and videos taken of bodies.  THE EVENTS Dachny Village The village of Dachny is located just outside of Grozny, adjacent to Michurina district east of the city, and stretches out for approximately two kilometers along the south side of the main road between Grozny and Argun. It covers several square kilometers and, on the south side, borders the main road between Grozny and Starye Atagi. Russian troops established control over Dachny village and the area around it in December 1999 as they closed in on Grozny.  On January 25, 2000, the Russian army established its main base at Khankala on the other side of the Grozny-Argun road, approximately one kilometer away from Dachny village. It continues to be the main Russian military base in Chechnya. Helicopters, tents, and towers are visible from the road. Since January 2000, the road has been used almost exclusively for military purposes, and civilians have apparently not been living in the village. Tracks of armored personnel carriers (APCs) and other military vehicles, however, suggest that Russian troops did visit the village during this period.  The Discovery of the Mass Grave Rumors that bodies had been discovered at the Dachny village started to circulate in Chechnya in late January 2001. However, as the village is located in the immediate vicinity of the main Russian military base in Chechnya, travel in the area is restricted. Many relatives of the missing and """"disappeared"""" told Human Rights Watch they were reluctant to conduct extensive searches so close to the military base because of fear of being shot at or detained.  The first of the bodies to be found at Dachny, that of Adam Chimaev, was reportedly recovered from the village on February 15, 2001. According to a witness, Chimaev had been detained at a Russian checkpoint between Shali and Germenchuk on December 3, 2000. In early February 2000, a military officer told Chimaev's relatives-who had been actively looking for him-that his body was in a cottage at Dachny village. The relatives subsequently paid the equivalent of U.S. $3,000 to be allowed to remove Chimaev's body from the village. Chimaev had been shot three times in the chest.  Russian officials responded to reports of a mass grave only after another group of relatives found the bodies of their """"disappeared"""" loved ones-Magomed Magomadov, Odes Mitaev, and Said-Rakhman Musaev-on February 21 and formally reported the discovery to the authorities. Russian forces on APCs had detained Magomadov, Mitaev, and Musaev on December 10, 2000, in their home village of Raduzhnoe. The relatives told Human Rights Watch that they found out about the dumping site by word of mouth, from a woman who was searching for her own son at Dachny.  The relatives said that they subsequently informed the authorities of their discovery. On February 24, 2001, the discovery of the mass dumping site became generally known, both in Chechnya and elsewhere. That day, then-Chechnya procurator (prosecutor) Vsevolod Chernov visited the site and procuracy officials confirmed that they had found numerous dead bodies in the village. According to Interfax, Chernov also announced that """"all the discovered bodies were mined,"""" something that could not be independently confirmed. According to media reports, the military sealed off the area to people seeking missing relatives.  The Recovery and Identification Process Between February 24 and March 2, 2001, Russian officials recovered forty-eight bodies from the village. On several occasions, government officials provided updated information on the number of bodies found, but otherwise volunteered no details about their investigation. On March 2, 2001, procurator Chernov announced that the """"inspection"""" of Dachny village had been completed.  The Chechen civilian procuracy, then headed by Chernov, led the operation, in which one forensic pathologist apparently participated. It is unclear what other law enforcement agencies and experts participated in the operation, where exactly the forty-eight bodies were found, and what evidence was discovered at the site that might lead to the identification of possible perpetrators. The bodies were put in body bags, which were numbered, and then taken to the Ministry of Emergency Situations (MChS) base in Grozny, where they were laid in rows on the floor of a huge empty and half-destroyed building used as a temporary morgue. Starting around February 27, 2001, relatives of missing persons were allowed to look at the bodies at the base.  The Burial of the Unidentified Bodies Relatives identified fourteen of the bodies. Without any prior announcement, on March 10, 2001, the Russian authorities buried thirty-four remaining unidentified bodies near Prigorodnoe, a village just outside Grozny. Photographs taken on the day of the burial show that each corpse was buried in a body bag in an individual grave in a field near the village. As of March 23, two of these bodies had been identified.  BACKGROUND ON THE IDENTIFIED BODIES Photo and video footage, as well as eyewitness testimony, indicate that the overwhelming majority of the corpses were dressed in civilian clothing and that most were adult men. At least four women were seen among the corpses. The hands, legs, or eyes of many were bound with wire or cloth, and most also bore gunshot wounds to the stomach, chest, or head. Photo and video footage show that the corpses were in varying stages of decay indicating they might have been at the burial site for as much as one year to as recently as several weeks.  Of those identified, the vast majority had previously been detained and """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian troops. Human Rights Watch and Memorial have gathered details on the taking into custody by federal forces and subsequent """"disappearance"""" of sixteen of the nineteen people whose bodies were identified. These cases followed the same pattern as that of more than a hundred other """"disappearance"""" cases Human Rights Watch has documented. In a typical """"disappearance,"""" federal agents-from the Russian military, police, or security forces-take someone into custody during """"sweep"""" operations or at a checkpoint. These same authorities later deny the detention occurred or any knowledge of the individual's whereabouts.  A number of the family members who were able to identify their relatives' bodies reported that in addition to gun shot wounds, the bodies showed clear signs of torture. For example, a relative of Odes Mitaev, who was last seen on December 10, 2000 in the custody of masked men in military uniforms driving APCs, reported to Human Rights Watch that Mitaev's """"eye had been knocked out (he lay on his stomach so it could not have been pecked out), his right ear was cut off and ... two fingers were cut off...."""" Similarly, the father of Islam Tazurkaev, who was last seen on January 20,2001, in the custody of Russian troops, reported that his son's """"right leg was broken, he had a broad cut from above his right ear down to just below his neck, there was a similar cut on the left side, the skin was stripped off his shoulder blades, his arms were broken, and he had been shot straight through the eye...."""" Human Rights Watch has documented the widespread torture of Chechen detainees by Russian forces throughout the conflict in Chechnya.  RUSSIA'S PUBLIC RESPONSE When news of the mass grave was first reported, Russian government officials immediately denied any responsibility, refused to provide the public with facts about the discovery and investigation, and misrepresented the facts in what little information was provided. Then-Chechnya procurator Vsevolod Chernov, the principal official commentator on the discovery of the bodies, gave inconsistent, contradictory, and often highly unlikely explanations for the grave. As more details became known about the background of the identified dead, the procurator eventually reluctantly admitted that some """"disappeared"""" civilians might be among them. The Russian procurator general and top government officials remained completely silent.  In his public statements, Chernov withheld key information and distorted evidence that implicated Russian forces in the deaths. On February 25, 2001, Chernov suggested that the bodies were civilians who had been killed by Chechen rebel fighters, stating that """"we might also find other individual graves of civilians killed by rebels at different times."""" However, he did not inform the public that the Khankala military base was adjacent to the dumping ground in Dachny village, nor did he mention that the bodies were found in an area long under Russian military control. Rebel fighters carrying numerous dead bodies would have had to repeatedly pass through highly secure military checkpoints near the base, which is unlikely. Chernov also failed to mention that there were fresh tracks of APCs in the village, which indicate the recent presence of Russian soldiers-Chechen rebel fighters do not have APCs. On March 2, 2001, Chernov misrepresented the appearance and condition of the bodies stating that most of the victims were rebel fighters, claiming they wore camouflage uniforms, Turkish underwear, and had bandaged gunshot wounds. The prosecutor did not mention that in a number of cases the arms remained tied behind their backs or on the stomach and that some were blindfolded, clearly indicating that these persons were in detention at the time of their death. He also failed to mention that some of the bodies bore clear signs of torture, including severed ears and fingers, scalpings, and broken limbs. His description of bandaged gunshot wounds and camouflage uniforms is not confirmed by photo and video footage of the corpses and appears to have been a blatant falsehood. Moreover, Turkish underwear is worn by millions of people across Russia.  THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION Russia has failed to conduct a thorough and credible investigation of the mass burial site. As a result of an inadequate identification procedure, the premature burial of thirty-four unidentified bodies, the failure to record and preserve important evidence, and inadequate autopsies of at least two-thirds of the bodies, important evidence that could have led to identification of the perpetrators has been lost. The inadequate investigative efforts in this case are typical of Russia's general failure to carry out meaningful investigations into widespread violations of human rights and humanitarian law that have been perpetrated by its troops over the course of the conflict in Chechnya.  Information about the criminal investigation from official sources has been scant. The Associated Press reported that a criminal investigation was opened on February 26. On March 2, Interfax quoted Chernov as saying that the Chechnya prosecutor's office and """"other law enforcement agencies"""" had set up a special analysis group to participate in the investigation into the discovery of the bodies. No further information has been forthcoming on the status of these investigations.  Russia's efforts look especially meager when judged by standards set out in two United Nations documents. The U.N. Economic and Social Council recommended in May 1989 that governments respect the Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (the 1989 Principles), which provides a broad approach to the issue. In May 1991, the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the U.N. Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs published a Manual on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions (the 1991 Manual), which details procedures for conducting investigations into extrajudicial executions.  The 1989 Principles provide, among other things, for the thorough, prompt, and impartial investigation of all extrajudicial executions. The purpose of the investigation shall be to determine the cause, manner, and time of death, the persons responsible, and any pattern or practice that may have caused that death. It shall include an adequate autopsy, collection and analysis of all physical and documentary evidence, and statements from witnesses. Where established procedures are inadequate, governments shall pursue investigations through an independent commission of inquiry or similar procedure.  The Identification Process The U.N. 1989 Principles require that those who conduct inquiries into suspicious deaths must """"seek to identify the victim."""" The Russian government, however, did not take any of the steps normally taken to expedite the identification process. In particular, the Russian government failed to use its access to television, radio, and newspapers to provide the public with information about the discovery of the bodies, announce the exact days and the location at which the bodies would be displayed to relatives of missing persons, or urge people to come to view the bodies. Most relatives of missing persons found out that the bodies were on display by word of mouth and sometimes by pure coincidence. By March 10, fourteen of the bodies on display at the MChS base had been identified.  Instead of making efforts to inform interested persons that they might view the remaining unidentified bodies for identification purposes, the remaining thirty-four bodies were hastily buried without having been identified on March 10, 2001. The Russian government and investigators made no prior announcement or explanation for the reburial. While additional bodies were identified practically every day prior to March 10, only two more bodies have been identified since.  Chechnya procurator Chernov reassured the Interfax news service that """"the material we gathered is more than sufficient for any future identification, no matter how complicated it may turn out to be."""" However, investigators failed to save the clothes the bodies were found in-a primary way of identifying otherwise unrecognizable bodies as well as potentially important evidence. As far as Human Rights Watch is aware, no equipment was available to investigators and pathologists to take dental X-rays and X-rays of skeletal irregularities. There is no evidence that investigators took other steps such as photographing facial structures and clothes, or taking fingerprints and samples for DNA testing, that would facilitate identification of bodies after burial.  The Forensic Examination Russian investigators failed to conduct adequate forensic examinations on at least two-thirds of the bodies that were recovered from Dachny village. Forensic examiners did not conduct full external examinations on each of the bodies, and failed to remove clothing for testing or inspection by relatives, or to remove rope and wire, and bullets from the bodies for later evidentiary use.  Investigation on the Scene The 1991 Manual, which includes a comprehensive checklist of the steps that should be followed during a basic forensic postmortem examination, recommends that medical investigators on the scene of a crime perform this series of steps, including photographing the body before it is moved as well as afterwards, recording the body's condition and position, examining the scene for blood, and storing the body in a secure refrigerated location.  It is clear that the bodies were not stored in cooling devices after removal from the village, because officials themselves complained about the lack of necessary equipment. While procuracy officials told journalists that the bodies at Dachny village were photographed and recorded on video and that a forensic pathologist participated in the recovery operation, it remains unclear what steps if any were taken to examine and preserve potentially crucial evidence from the burial site.  The Autopsy Pathologists and investigators did not observe key elements recommended by the 1991 Manual for the conduct of a proper autopsy, particularly concerning the need to remove clothing and """"foreign objects"""" carefully and preserve them for later evidentiary use, as well as the requirement of a thorough external examination. However, a comprehensive assessment of the examinations cannot be made at this point due to a lack of information about the examination and a failure, so far, by investigators to provide relatives of the deceased who have been identified with examination reports-as set out in the Manual.  Photographs taken on March 10, 2001 of the thirty-four bodies that were not identified reveal that practically all of the corpses were clothed and that in a number of cases the arms remained tied behind their backs or on the stomach even after the examination was completed. It is thus evident that items of clothing and """"foreign objects,"""" such as rope and wire, were not removed from the bodies. Procuracy officials at the MChS base told Memorial on February 28, 2001 that bullets were not removed from the bodies either. It is therefore highly unlikely that the forensic examiner conducted an adequate external examination of these bodies.  It remains unclear how thoroughly the forensic pathologist examined the clothing and those parts of the body that were not covered by clothing or easily accessible. It is unlikely that any radiography of the bodies was performed as the forensic examiner himself complained that he had no equipment that would have allowed X-rays.  Failure to Create Appropriate Conditions The Russian government failed to provide investigators with sufficient expert staff and technical resources to conduct adequate examinations of each of the bodies. An official who participated in the investigation told Memorial that only one forensic pathologist had been available to examine the bodies. Considering that this pathologist had to examine forty-eight bodies, it is clear that he could not spend sufficient time with each. Furthermore, the official told Memorial that the pathologist's equipment was limited to rubber gloves and a scalpel.  The Investigation As of this writing, it is too early to provide a comprehensive assessment of the efforts by investigators to track down and question relevant witnesses or to establish the identity of those responsible for the killings and secret burials at Dachny. However, the failure to save material evidence, such as clothes and bullets, does not bode well. Furthermore, the fact that the investigation to date has been conducted by investigators from the civilian procuracy who do not have the authority to question military servicemen does not bode well. This lack of authority has been a major obstacle to investigating all criminal cases against Russian forces in Chechnya.  It is also currently unclear what kind of ongoing investigation the procuracy is conducting with regard to the thirty-four unidentified bodies. Their premature burial in their clothes has significantly decreased the chances that these bodies will ever be identified. It will be more difficult to establish the facts surrounding their deaths without having first established their identity.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia","International Justice"

On the eve of the Quebec summit of Western hemisphere leaders, Human Rights Watch called for the creation of an independent oversight agency to spur remedial action for workers' rights violations.  """"The NAFTA experience is an important lesson for any future trade agreements,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"Our research shows that agreements on labor will never work without the active support of the countries involved. In the case of NAFTA, these three countries have actually worked to minimize the impact of the labor provisions.""""  Vivanco urged that the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), a key agenda item at the Quebec summit, should be designed to avoid the weaknesses of the NAFTA regime.  The 64-page report, """"Trading Away Rights: The Unfulfilled Promise of NAFTA's Labor Side Agreement,"""" analyzes the twenty-three complaints filed under the accord since it came into force in 1994. The complaints allege systematic workers' rights violations in all three countries - fourteen in Mexico, seven in the United States, and two in Canada. Companies named as violators include General Electric, Honeywell, Sony, General Motors, McDonald's, Sprint, and the Washington State apple industry.  The NAFTA labor provisions, known formally as the North American Agreement on Labor Cooperation (NAALC), are the most ambitious link between trade and labor rights ever implemented, Human Rights Watch said. They include eleven """"labor principles"""" including freedom of association, discrimination, and minimum wage. The accord also requires the signatories to have high labor standards and provide access to fair labor tribunals.  Complaints filed under the NAALC so far have cited favoritism toward employer-controlled unions; firings for workers' organizing efforts; denial of collective bargaining rights; forced pregnancy testing; mistreatment of migrant workers; life-threatening health and safety conditions; and other violations of the eleven """"labor principles.""""  Human Rights Watch said that not one of the 23 complaints filed under NAALC had so far resulted in sanctions against an alleged labor rights violator.  Human Rights Watch urged that labor rights protections should be recognized as an integral part of any trade agreement, rather than being relegated to a side accord. It also said that sanctions should be used to punish any violation of the NAALC's labor principles and obligations, not only non-enforcement of laws that fall within the narrow categories established under NAALC.  The NAALC rules currently lack standards for accepting or rejecting cases, for following up on issues raised by petitioners, or for deciding what constitutes an appropriate government response to violations. But Human Rights Watch said the NAALC could be used much more effectively, even in its current form, if its oversight bodies were more aggressive in pursuing violations. Unfortunately, the NAALC oversight bodies - called National Administrative Offices - have failed to act aggressively.  """"The NAFTA labor accords suffer from both structural defects and a lack of political will,"""" said Vivanco. """"Taken together, they represent a very serious blow to labor rights in the region.""""  As part of its work to promote labor rights, Human Rights Watch has filed two petitions before the NAALC since 1996.","Americas, Canada, Global","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Their trial marks a major development in international justice, Human Rights Watch said today.  """"This is the first time a jury of ordinary people will judge ordinary people of another country who have been accused of such terrible crimes,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, who will be an expert witness at the trial. """"The jurors will have to surmount the barrier of cultural differences to understand a context unlike any they have ever known. They will have to confront the horror and try to look into the hearts of people accused of behavior that seems unimaginable.""""     None of the four accused was a government official at the time of the genocide. Consolata Mukangango (Sister Gertrude) and Julienne Mukabutera (Sister Marie Kisito) were members of a religious congregation. Alphonse Higaniro headed a match factory and Vincent Ntezimana was a professor at the National University of Rwanda.     Although the charges arise from a genocide, the accused will be tried at the Brussels Cour d'Assises for violations of the Geneva conventions and of the Belgian penal code because genocide was not a crime under Belgian law in 1994. The trial is expected to last six weeks.     Since the international community acknowledged its responsibility for punishing crimes against humanity, professional jurists have judged the accused in international tribunals like that at Nuremberg after World War II and like the two international tribunals set up by the United Nations to hear cases from Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. Two years ago, a Swiss military tribunal became the first national court to judge such a case where neither the perpetrator nor the victim was a citizen of its state and where the crime took place elsewhere. The Swiss court found a Rwandan burgomaster guilty of violating the Geneva conventions and sentenced him to life in prison, a sentence later reduced on appeal to twenty years.     International justice has proved expensive and slow, in part because the court must deal with different languages and legal traditions. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will never judge more than a relatively small number of the perpetrators and now is focusing on those who held important posts in the government, the military, the media, and in political parties.     In Rwandan courts, judges have tried more than 4,000 of their fellow citizens on charges of genocide, but no jury trials have been held. The government will shortly launch a system of participative justice called """"gacaca"""" in which popularly elected judges will decide the fate of the accused. More than 100,000 persons await trial in Rwanda, some of them having spent nearly seven years in detention without being judged.     Rwandan courts and the gacaca proceedings will deal with the vast number of persons accused inside the country, but they will rarely try those now in exile. In some cases, other governments may refuse to extradite accused persons to Rwanda because of concerns about the fairness of the proceedings or about the possible imposition of the death penalty.     """"Some of those who committed genocide in Rwanda will never come before either the International Tribunal or Rwandan courts,"""" said Des Forges. """"Unless the judicial systems of other nations try the accused who end up on their territory, some persons guilty of the most heinous crime known to humankind may escape punishment.""""     Administrative, military, and political authorities directed the 1994 genocide, which killed at least half a million of the Tutsi minority in one hundred days. With the help of radio stations, the authorities incited and ordered ordinary people to participate in the killing campaign. In some cases those who refused to kill or who tried to save Tutsi were themselves slain.     """"For decades we all have decried crimes against humanity,"""" Des Forges added. """"This trial in Belgium offers the hope of transforming our anguish into something more effective, a way to punish and perhaps even prevent such horrors.""""     In 1999 Human Rights Watch together with the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues published Leave None to Tell the Story, an 800 page history based on five years of research.","Africa, Europe/Central Asia, Rwanda, Belgium","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/04/12/malaysia-release-political-detainees","Malaysia- Release Political Detainees","Malaysia: Release Political Detainees","","04/12/2001","Human Rights Watch today called for the immediate release of seven Malaysian opposition political figures who were arrested April 10-11 under Malaysia's notorious Internal Security Act (ISA). The seven were arrested just days before the second anniversary of the sentencing of imprisoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim. On April 14, 1999, Anwar was sentenced to six years in prison, and, each year since then, supporters have planned rallies to mark the anniversary, known in Malaysia as """"Black 14."""" Malaysian authorities have indicated that more arrests may follow in the coming days. """"This is political bullying pure and simple,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The Internal Security Act is tailor-made for authoritarian leaders who want to lock up political opponents.""""  Human Rights Watch, in its global review of rights developments in 2000, noted that the human rights situation in Malaysia had deteriorated, largely because of Prime Minister Mahathir's determination to crush his political rivals.  All of the seven who have been arrested are well-established opposition figures and most are members of the opposition party Keadilian, founded by Anwar's wife Wan Azizah. Those arrested are: Tian Chua, 37, Keadilian vice-president; Saari Sungib, 43, a member of the Keadilian's policy making council; Ezam Mohamad Noor, 34, Keadilian youth leader; N. Gobalakrishnan, 41, Keadilan youth secretary; activists Abdul Ghani Harun, 36, and Hishamuddin Rais, 50; and Raja Petra Kamarudin, 49, director of the Free Anwar campaign. Malaysian authorities have said that the seven currently being detained were arrested """"because there was information about their involvement in an activity which could endanger the security of the country,"""" an apparent reference to the planned rallies. According to local reports, Malaysian Inspector-General of Police Norian Mai further alleged at an April 11 press conference that the detainees """"were planning militant actions to topple the government"""" and implied that they had been involved in trying to obtain explosives. He profferred no evidence to support these extreme allegations and Malaysia's Internal Security Act (ISA) requires none. The ISA allows the detention of suspects for up to two years, with the possibility of renewal every two years. Any police officer may, without a warrant, arrest and detain anyone he has """"reason to believe"""" has acted or is likely to act in """"any manner prejudicial to the security of Malaysia."""" For the first sixty days, detainees may be held without access to lawyers.  In addition to provisions for arrest, the ISA allows for restrictions on freedom of assembly, association, and expression, freedom of movement, residence and employment. It also allows for the closing of schools and educational institutions if they are used as a meeting place for an unlawful organization or for any other reason are deemed detrimental to the interests of Malaysia or the public. The right of ISA detainees to be fairly charged and tried is restricted not only by the provisions in the ISA for indefinitely renewable detention without trial, but also by a June 1989 amendment removing the jurisdiction of courts to hear habeas corpus petitions from ISA detainees. The ISA was used to arrest political opponents of Mahathir in a major crackdown in 1987-88, as well as politicians in Sabah, east Malaysia, in 1990, whose party was considered a major rival to the ruling party, UMNO. In November 1997, ten people were arrested under the ISA for allegedly spreading Shiite teachings deemed detrimental to national security; Muslims in Malaysia are Sunnis. The law has also been used to arrest scores of individuals believed to have facilitated the illegal entry of foreign workers into Malaysia. In 1998, ISA was the basis for the initial arrest of Anwar and six of his political supporters.","Asia, Malaysia",""

Rotberg and Dennis Thompson. Eds.: Truth v. Justice: The Morality of Truth Commissions  Priscilla B. Hayner: Unspeakable Truths Confronting State Terror and Atrocity Ruti G. Teitel: Transitional Justice Richard J. Goldstone: For Humanity: Reflections of a War Crimes Investigator If Gen. Augusto Pinochet had not been arrested in England on the night of October 16, 1998, the truth about his crimes would never have been fully revealed and democracy in Chile might have remained in a state of arrested development. Eight years after Pinochet relinquished power, he still cast a long shadow over Chilean society. The Senate was stacked with his supporters. The Chilean courts lacked true independence. Painfully little progress had been made in restoring democratic rights to the importance they had enjoyed before the military takeover. Although a majority of Chileans hoped that Pinochet would stand trial for the atrocities committed during his rule, the """"Senator for Life"""" benefited from parliamentary immunity and a 1978 amnesty that the military had granted itself. In the face of Pinochet's lingering power, the elected government quickly abandoned its pledge to seek derogation or annulment of the self-amnesty law. Indeed, despite a highly regarded report by a government-sponsored truth commission, proof of Pinochet's own role in the worst atrocities remained largely circumstantial. Pinochet's arrest by British police, and his seventeen months of humiliating detention, changed all that, unleashing a renewed debate in Chile about the legacy of the military government and rekindling hopes of justice for Pinochet's thousands of victims. Previously timid Chilean judges began looking for chinks in the dictator's legal armor. After decades of silence, Pinochet's former collaborators stepped forward to tell of his role in covering up atrocities, revelations that have had a snowball effect. The number of criminal cases against Pinochet jumped to dozens, then hundreds. By the time British Home Secretary Jack Straw sent Pinochet back to Chile, ostensibly on health grounds, the myth of his immunity had been totally shattered. The reinvigorated Chilean courts skirted the 1978 military self-amnesty by ruling that prosecutions of ongoing """"disappearances"""" are not barred, because the crime continues as long as the fate of the victim is concealed. Pinochet could thus be prosecuted for his role in the """"Caravan of Death,"""" a helicopter-borne military group that executed and """"disappeared"""" seventy-five political prisoners shortly after the 1973 coup. In a historic ruling last August, the Chilean Supreme Court lifted Pinochet's senatorial immunity. Months later he was formally indicted by a Chilean judge for murder and disappearances and placed under house arrest, something that would have been simply inconceivable two years ago. At several stages, Pinochet's shrill and seemingly powerful supporters-the military, the wealthy and the principal newspapers they own-sought to create an institutional crisis with gestures of defiance; but each time they backed down in the face of government and popular support for the rule of law. When Pinochet was questioned about the Caravan of Death by the investigating judge, a historic act in itself, he seemed to pass the buck down the chain of command. This prompted Joaquin Lagos, a retired general who commanded a prison visited by the caravan, to go on television in January-the first time he had told his story publicly. He was graphic: """"They took out [the victims'] eyes with knives, broke their jaws, their legs and then killed them."""" He said he reported the killings in writing to Pinochet, who rather than reprimanding the murderers asked Lagos to alter his report. A week later, Chilean newspapers published a document bearing Pinochet's signature with orders to cover up the torture of a political opponent. According to Roberto Garretón, a leading Chilean human rights lawyer, """"October 16 [Pinochet's London arrest] was fundamental, so that we could at last complete our transition to democracy."""" The Pinochet case has inspired victims of abuse in country after country, particularly in Latin America, to challenge the transitional arrangements of five and ten years ago, which allowed the perpetrators of atrocities to go unpunished and, often, to remain in power. These temporary accommodations with the ancien régime did not extinguish the victims' thirst to bring their former tormentors to justice. In Guatemala, a powerful UN-sponsored truth commission report issued in 1999, which charged that the military, with US support, committed acts of genocide against Mayan Indians, has spurred victims to seek redress in the courts of both Guatemala and Spain. In Argentina, years after amnesty laws put an end to """"Dirty War"""" prosecutions, eleven officials, including four members of the military juntas, are either in jail or under house arrest for """"baby-snatching,"""" the theft of the children of disappeared mothers; and just weeks ago, on March 6, an Argentine judge boldly struck down the 1987 amnesty laws as a violation of both the national constitution and international law. At the same time, Pinochet's London arrest reflected, and strengthens, a new (though uneven) international movement-spurred by the twin genocides of the 1990s in Bosnia and Rwanda, and facilitated by the end of the cold war-to end impunity for the worst abuses. After the creation of United Nations tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda, in 1998 the UN voted overwhelmingly in Rome to establish an International Criminal Court to prosecute future genocides, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes when national courts are unable or unwilling to do so. The United States, after failing to win a 100 percent guarantee that no US soldier or policy-maker would ever be prosecuted, was one of only seven countries to oppose the Rome treaty. President Clinton did sign the treaty, however, to remain involved in the court's formation, and though the Bush Administration may be less willing to play along, much less ratify it, the ICC is sure to have the needed sixty ratifications (it now has twenty-nine) within a few years. """"International justice"""" is already beginning to be a plausible backstop when national justice fails or a perpetrator flees. In Sierra Leone and Cambodia, the UN is preparing to sponsor tribunals together with local authorities. Former dictator of Chad Hissène Habré was arrested on torture charges last year in his Senegalese exile. (The Senegalese Court of Final Appeals ruled in March that he could not be tried there, but human rights groups are now seeking his extradition to stand trial in Belgium.) The Mexican government has agreed to extradite to Spain an Argentine naval officer accused by Judge Baltasar Garzón of torture. A Dutch court is pressing charges against former Surinamese military strongman Desi Bouterse for the 1982 killing of fifteen government opponents. Shadowy Peruvian spymaster Vladimiro Montesinos was surprised to find that in the post-Pinochet world he was denied exile even in Panama, which had acquired something of a reputation as a safe haven for the world's washed-up dictators. (Raoul Cédras of Haiti and Jorge Serrano of Guatemala are there now; in the past it hosted the Shah of Iran.) On March 20, in a landmark ruling, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights said that the amnesty laws of Peru violated the American Convention on Human Rights. Like Chile's prosecution of Pinochet, Serbia's recent arrest of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic on corruption charges also illustrates the dynamic interplay between international and national justice. Milosevic's indictment by the Yugoslavia war crimes tribunal, and the international pressure on Serbia to act, certainly facilitated the dramatic move-and like the arrest of Pinochet, the showdown in Belgrade has further weakened Milosevic, who is sure to be discredited even more as details of his crimes emerge. Of course, prosecuting Milosevic in Serbia on corruption charges can never provide justice for the hundreds of thousands of non-Serb victims of wartime atrocities in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo, and the international community is right to insist on Milosevic's transfer to The Hague to face trial for his worst crimes. All these events have revived the debate over what has become known as """"transitional justice""""-or, as Ruti Teitel phrases it in her book of that name, """"How should societies deal with their evil past?"""" Teitel's book offers a historical and comparative analysis of the problem and, while dense and at times repetitive, raises the key practical, legal and moral dilemmas facing transitional regimes. """"What emerges,"""" she writes, is a """"pragmatic balancing of ideal justice with political realism."""" Focusing on the role of the law itself in times of transition, Teitel observes that """"legal practices bridge a persistent struggle between two points: adherence to established convention and radical transformation.Š the jurisprudence of these periods does not follow such core principles of legality as regularity, generality, and prospectivity-the very essence of the rule of law in ordinary times."""" At the heart of the matter is whether to prosecute those who have committed atrocities. Most people would agree that leaders who organize mass murder, torture and the like should be brought to justice. The history of the past fifty years, however, reveals that until very recently, butchers like Pinochet, Idi Amin, Ferdinand Marcos, Anastasio Somoza and Mengistu Haile Mariam were less likely to end up behind bars than a squeegee man from the streets of New York. In Teitel's words, """"transitional practices show trials to be few and far between, particularly in the contemporary period."""" The reason was sometimes pragmatic-these tyrants were offered a way out to induce them to hand over power without making their people suffer further. As Teitel notes, the legal and practical questions are also not trivial. Often the courts are so corrupted that a fair trial is impossible. When the crimes were committed at the regime's outset, there are problems of statutory limitations. It is impossible to prosecute all the perpetrators in criminal regimes, but selective prosecutions can also create injustice. Enter truth commissions. They were first established in places like Argentina and Chile, where deniable disappearances made truth the first order of the day. But it is South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission that, """"though flawed in many ways, has set a high standard for future commissions,"""" in the words of Robert Rotberg in his excellent introduction to the subject in Truth v. Justice, an engaging collection of essays mainly about South Africa. The contributors examine the TRC and debate the fundamental moral question suggested by Amy Gutmann and Dennis Thompson: Can one """"sacrifice the pursuit of justice as usually understood for the sake of promoting other social purposes such asŠreconciliation""""? The TRC was an explicit political compromise between the broad amnesty that apartheid leaders sought and the prosecutions proposed by the African National Congress, which would have antagonized any hope of a peaceful transition. The ingenious solution was to keep the prosecution option open (some were indeed conducted) but grant individual amnesties for those who came forward and told the truth about their crimes, in public and often on television. This quasi-penal process encouraged confession and transparency. As Ronald Slye says in his essay in Truth v. Justice, the TRC's was """"the most sophisticated amnesty undertaken in modern times, if not in any time, for acts that constitute violations of fundamental international human rights."""" The TRC process has been rightly challenged because it focused not on the apartheid system itself, including massive displacements and the pass system, but on """"excesses"""" that even apartheid considered criminal, like murder and torture. And while there were a number of dramatic examples of victimizers and victims embracing, there was no requirement that the perpetrators atone or ask forgiveness to obtain amnesty. A respected poll showed that two-thirds of South Africans believed that the TRC investigations led to a deterioration of race relations. Nevertheless, """"it can safely be said that South Africa is a better country in light of the accomplishments"""" of the TRC, as Richard Goldstone writes in a short essay in his book. The TRC's major accomplishment, says Goldstone, a leading South African judge who went on to become the first prosecutor of both the Rwanda and Yugoslavia tribunals (about which he also writes), is that no one now can deny the worst manifestations of apartheid. Yet the human rights movement now faces a """"South Africa problem"""": While the TRC amnesty-for-truth process merits respect as the most honestly designed transitional arrangement short of """"real"""" justice (i.e., prosecution), most of its counterparts around the world are producing or promising a lot more amnesty than truth. The conditions in South Africa, particularly the credible threat of widespread prosecution, which brought all manner of perpetrators forward, are hard to replicate elsewhere, especially in the developing world. At the same time, prosecutions, as we have seen, are much more politically possible than just five years ago. Yet it seems that because of South Africa, the international community has become blindly besotted with truth commissions, regardless of how they are established and whether they are seen as precursors or complements to justice or, very often now, as substitutes for justice. According to Priscilla Hayner in Unspeakable Truths, her useful analysis of truth commissions around the world, they are """"fast becoming a staple in the transitional justice menu of options."""" Truth commissions can indeed produce important results. They can uncover hidden abuses and lift the veil of denial, help a fractured country come to grips with its past, provide a platform for victims and propose structural reforms. But to be as effective as the TRC, truth commissions must be independent, well resourced and endowed with subpoena power; must hold public hearings when necessary; and must be able to name the accused publicly. Few commissions today meet these criteria. Commissions can also lay the groundwork for reparations to the victims in a way that trials probably cannot. My own experience bears out Hayner's observation that """"especially for the very poor, the possibility of receiving financial assistance seems to be a primary reason to come forward to give testimony."""" In Chile the families of those listed by the commission as killed or disappeared (but not those tortured) receive monthly checks for life. In Argentina, litigation before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights has resulted in payments to families as well as to those wrongly detained or exiled. As Hayner points out, however, """"in very poor states, or where hundreds of thousands of persons were killed or disappeared, substantial individualized monetary compensation may simply not be feasible."""" Indeed, the compensation recommended by the El Salvador and Haiti commissions has never materialized. Even in South Africa, victims remain frustrated in their attempts to win meaningful compensation. """"Reconciliation,"""" on the other hand, even if it could be defined, is too contested an ideal on which to base policy. Many victims, particularly in Latin America, see """"reconciliation"""" without contrition by the perpetrators (or their punishment) as a cruel joke. Argentine journalist Horacio Verbitsky, who spearheads the campaign to overturn Argentina's amnesty law, says that """"to try to impose reconciliation between the families of the victims and their executioners would be sadistic from an individual point of view and irrelevant for society. The only solid base on which to build the future is for all citizens to accept the law and its procedures."""" This echoes David Crocker in Truth v. Justice: """"It is morally objectionable as well as impractical for a truth commissionŠto force people to agree about the past, forgive the sins committed against them, or love one another."""" On a more practical level, Hayner quotes Argentine activist Juan Mendez as saying that in his country reconciliation """"was a code word for those who wanted nothing done."""" Yet to many international donors, reconciliation is a feel-good idea, while justice, as we are seeing now in Chile, is a potentially messy affair in which there are not only winners but losers. But the perpetrators of atrocities should be losers. Hayner defines truth commissions as bodies that """"investigat[e] politically motivated or politically targeted repression that was used as a means to maintain or obtain power and weaken political opponents."""" If the leaders used repression to empower themselves, then in an ideal transition they are disempowered, something that trial, conviction and punishment does most effectively. In the best of cases, of course, truth commissions can lead to justice, and the two are naturally complementary. Hayner correctly notes that in Argentina and Chad the facts compiled by truth commissions were later used by prosecutors. But Hayner, who is regularly consulted in the establishment of truth commissions, too easily brushes off the charge that there is no trade-off between truth and justice. She quotes a Guatemalan minister of defense: """"We are fully in support of a truth commission. Just as in Chile: truth, but no trials."""" (In fact, the Guatemalan truth commission has given impetus to justice efforts.) Into the early 1990s, truth may have been the best the victims could hope for. Today it is increasingly seen by abusive governments as a soft option for avoiding justice. Sierra Leone, in a somewhat different context, illustrates the folly of trading justice for truth. The brutal civil war waged by the rebel Revolutionary United Front was characterized by the most revolting abuses I have personally witnessed, including the rebels' signature atrocity of cutting off the arms of civilians. A peace agreement signed in July 1999 included, with South Africa in mind, a blanket amnesty and a truth commission. In a historic move, the UN, under pressure from rights activists, backed away from the pact's amnesty, but no steps were actually taken to bring the perpetrators to justice. Not surprisingly, within months the rebels were at it again. Only when they made the mistake of attacking UN peacekeepers, however, was rebel leader Foday Sankoh arrested, and a UN-sponsored tribunal is now being established to try Sankoh and his henchmen. Truth commissions can also divert international attention and scarce resources from justice efforts. In Haiti, where I worked with President Aristide's minister of justice, we were explicitly told by international donors that they could not fund a special prosecutor's office-the government's priority-because they were supporting a truth commission (whose report, published years after its completion, only confirmed what people already knew about coup-era repression). It is true that trials are more demanding and costly than truth commissions. Criminal guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. It's one thing to say that thousands were killed under Pinochet; it is harder to prove his personal guilt in a particular case. But because most commissions rely on victim testimony, they fail to infiltrate the repressive apparatus, which, as we are now seeing in Chile (and as any prosecutor of organized crime knows), is the best way to establish the individual responsibility of top officials. And while truth commissions can elicit broader historical truths than trials, the value of this will depend on whether the crimes were carried out in a manner designed to evade responsibility (say, by disappearances or death squads) or whether, as in Bosnia, Rwanda and Sierra Leone, they were incited and practiced in the open. At least where they are politically possible, there are other powerful reasons to use trials. Truth-telling, however complete, simply does not adequately address the gravity of many crimes. As Aryeh Neier has argued, the results of a truth process would not have been commensurate to the criminality that took place in Rwanda or Bosnia. Trials are a foundational and forward-looking affirmation that no group, including public officials and the armed forces, is above the law and that the new democracy will not tolerate such behavior. (Teitel argues that they are, at the same time, backward-looking.) Indeed, trials can emphasize that a transition to democracy has been successful by demonstrating that the ancien régime is too weak to impede them. Trials also enable victims to establish or recover their dignity as holders of legal rights. In Haiti, the total impunity with which a small elite literally got away with murder and plunder for generations had left the poor majority assuming that they had no rights. Trials can also (if conducted fairly) juxtapose the meticulous rules of due process with the conduct of the accused. While it was a rich irony that Pinochet, whose war tribunals conducted sham trials and ordered the summary execution of political opponents, would take advantage of the full measure of British rule of law for well over a year, it was precisely in honor of the rule of law that he was prosecuted. The argument that if perpetrators are threatened with prosecution they will not relinquish power, or will undermine a new democracy, deserves attention. In some negotiated transitions, such as South Africa, this may be true and should impose a responsible caution. In most cases, however (think of Cédras and Duvalier in Haiti, Stroessner in Paraguay, Idi Amin in Uganda, Mobutu in Zaire, Suharto in Indonesia), bloody despots are overthrown or leave kicking and screaming when their time is up anyway. Last year, it was widely argued that to induce Slobodan Milosevic to step down, he should be assured that he would not be prosecuted. No such assurances were made, and he not only gave up power, he is now being prosecuted domestically and is likely to stand trial one day before a war crimes tribunal. Fears of destabilization are often brandished by successor governments that would rather accommodate the ancien régime than invest the political capital in disempowering it further. In Chile, forebodings expressed by opponents of Pinochet's arrest (including the elected government) that """"reopening old wounds"""" would threaten the country's democracy were revealed to be largely a bluff-democracy has in fact been strengthened. In Argentina in 1987, after trials of the top generals threatened to spread to more junior military officers, rebellious officers began a mutiny. In a tense moment for the young democracy, civilians surrounded the barracks and some 200,000 people gathered in the Plaza de Mayo to support the constitutional order. Rather than capitalizing on this public outpouring to strengthen civilian control, President Raul Alfonsín asked the throngs to go home and then halted further prosecutions. While it is hard to second-guess a president with solid democratic credentials faced with a very real revolt, it is undeniable that his path of lesser confrontation led to spiraling military demands, including the eventual pardons of those already convicted, and the consequent weakening of democratic institutions. While the House of Lords was hearing arguments that would lead to its famous decisions that Pinochet was not immune from torture charges, South Africa's last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, was across London releasing his autobiography. """"Would an apartheid criminal who has been granted an amnestyŠbe liable to be prosecuted for crimes against humanity in a non-South African court?"""" asks Richard Goldstone in For Humanity. Goldstone has """"no doubt that such a prosecutor [of a foreign court or the future ICC] should not be inhibited by national amnesties. In international law they clearly have no standing and would not afford a defense to criminal or civil proceedings before an international court or a national court other than that of the country that grants the amnesty. That does not mean that in deciding on an investigation or prosecution, the prosecutor will not take into account"""" the circumstances of the amnesty. Goldstone sensibly proposes that """"an international prosecutor ignore self-amnesties of the kind granted to General Pinochet,"""" which unfortunately are the norm around the world. On the other hand, he suggests that it would be appropriate in the South African case for the prosecutor, in the exercise of his or her discretion, to take into account the fact that the individual amnesties were granted pursuant to a scheme """"approved by a democratically elected legislature-a legislature that is representative of the victims of apartheid."""" One area begging for a truth commission is US support for atrocities abroad. Because the US public would not have countenanced open and notorious American support for crimes against humanity, there was usually, as in Nicaragua or Chile, a layer of deniability, either about the crimes or about US support or, as in East Timor in 1975, a virtual news blackout. The national truth commissions in El Salvador, Chile and Haiti were disappointingly silent on US complicity. Their counterparts in Guatemala and Chad were less shy. As a result of recent Pinochet-driven disclosures, the fuller US role in undermining Chile's democracy and then in knowingly supporting Pinochet's crimes is coming to light. Proving the individual criminal (as opposed to political) liability in specific abuses of high-ranking American policy-makers such as Henry Kissinger may not be easy and prosecutions politically unlikely (especially as Dr. Kissinger now watches where he travels). But a full airing of US cold war support for abusive forces in places like Chad, El Salvador, Greece, Haiti, Indonesia and Nicaragua (and direct US atrocities in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam) by an officially appointed nonpolitical panel could establish an important historical record, promote a measure of accountability and, if the United States were ready to apologize (as Clinton recently did to Guatemala), foster a kind of reconciliation with the countries whose people suffered the abuses.

Mr Misabiko was arrested by the National Security Agency (ANR) in Lubumbashi, Katanga province, where he is the President of the provincial ASADHO section. He is reportedly accused of leaking information about the execution of a high military commander, Anselme Masasu, in November 2000, which formed the basis of an ASADHO statement. The government has only recently admitted that Anselme Masasu was court martialed and executed. On 6 February, one day after this arrest, Mr Misabiko was transferred to a lockup in Kinshasa, where he was reportedly ill-treated.

Commission: Back Strong Chechnya Resolution","","04/11/2001","Human Rights Watch applauded today's introduction by the European Union of a resolution on the situation in the Chechnya region of the Russian Federation at the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, but called on other governments to strengthen the text and join as co-sponsors. At its last session, in April 2000, the Commission passed a resolution expressing deep concern about human rights and humanitarian law violations in Chechnya and calling on all parties in the conflict to halt abuses. That resolution also urged the Russian government to set up an independent national commission of inquiry to investigate violations-the first time a Commission resolution censured a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council. But one year later, the Russian government has defied the Commission: there have been no effective domestic prosecutions, no national commission of inquiry established, and many serious abuses continue on a daily basis.  """"In the face of this blatant non-compliance, the Commission must react strongly,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Otherwise the Commission leaves itself open to accusations of double standards and lack of firm principles.""""  The draft resolution tabled today, strongly condemns the use of disproportionate force and serious human rights violations by Russian military forces, federal servicemen and state agents and calls on the Russians to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors undertake credible and exhaustive criminal investigations of all violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws, but it fails to set up an international commission of inquiry.  Human Rights Watch has insisted that any resolution on Chechnya should:  condemn ongoing human rights and humanitarian law violations in Chechnya; note the total failure on the part of the Russian government to implement the Commission's previous resolution; note the inadequacy of Russia's domestic prosecutorial efforts; and establish an international commission of inquiry that is mandated to investigate and document atrocities committed by both sides to the conflict in Chechnya. Any international commission should be impartial and independent and operate in a manner consistent with the general principles outlined by High Commissioner Mary Robinson in her April 2000 background note on national commissions of inquiry.  The European Union, the resolution's chief sponsor, is expected to continue to try to reach agreement with the Russian government on a weaker """"chairman's statement"""" in place of the resolution. A chairman's statement requires consensus approval by all commission members, whereas a resolution is adopted by a majority vote in the Commission.  A draft of the chairman's statement obtained by Human Rights Watch reflected a significant backpedaling from the position taken by the E.U. and other co-sponsors in last year's resolution. Indeed, the statement omits any reference to the 2000 resolution and Russia's failure to comply with it.  Some have argued that a weak chairman's statement would be preferable to a resolution because it would at least imply a Russian government commitment to comply. Human Rights Watch called such arguments preposterous.  """"The Russian government has had a whole year to take the kinds of meaningful steps toward accountability recommended in last year's resolution. Not only has there been no action on past atrocities, abuses in Chechnya continue today,"""" said Cartner.

""""This is a throwback to the ugliest Soviet repression against the dissident movement of the 1970s,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch.  A letter written by Urlaeva was smuggled out from the psychiatric hospital. According to the letter, police arrested her as she left her home at approximately 9:00 a.m., and brought her to Tashkent's Mirzo Ulugbek district police headquarters, where officers beat her, confiscated her documents, and interrogated her. From there the police transferred her to the Municipal Clinical Psychiatric Hospital no. 1, where on April 7 a medical commission, in which the deputy district police chief took part, ordered Urlaeva to undergo """"compulsory treatment."""" The Mirzo Ulugbek district court in Tashkent confirmed this decision the following day.  The head doctor, Professor Khairulla Khusankhujaev, reportedly denigrated Urlaeva and her fellow human rights activists during the medical commission, and stated that Urlaeva was fulminating against the nation's president. Urlaeva quoted him as saying, """"I've seen many demonstrators with placards during my forty years, but in the psychiatric hospital they always quiet down and stop speaking out.""""  According to Tolib Iakubov, head of the Human Rights Society of Uzbekistan who spoke to Urlaeva briefly on Sunday, April 8, the physician who performed the intake interview said that she was perfectly healthy and that she should not be hospitalized. Urlaeva, who until 1999 worked for the national television company, had never been treated for mental illness. When reached for comment, Prof. Khusankhujaev confirmed that Urlaeva was beingheld in his institution, but gave no further information on the case.  The timing and circumstances surrounding Urlaeva's hospitalization raise serious concerns that she is being targeted for her recent human rights activism. Urlaeva first came to the attention of authorities in October 2000, when she severely criticized the government at the Annual Implementation Meeting of the OSCE Office of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights in Warsaw. On February 19 police in Tashkent detained her for seven hours, confiscating her passport, several documents and notes pertaining to her human rights activities, and forcing her to sign a statement admitting that these documents were """"anti-constitutional."""" On March 7 Urlaeva led the first in a series of public protests against a road-building project entailing the destruction of private homes in the city, and was on her way to the planned demonstration when police stopped her. On March 20 she announced that she would remain on hunger strike until the municipal government acceded to the demands of those whose homes were slated for destruction. """"Clearly, this is another in a long list of government efforts to silence human rights activists and should be condemned by the international community in no uncertain terms,"""" continued Cartner. """"They should call for Urlaeva's immediate release.""""  Background:  The Soviet practice of using psychiatric institutions against those who protest government policies became widespread under Brezhnev during the late 1960s, leading to the Soviet Union's expulsion from the World Psychiatric Association in 1983. Uzbek officials continued to misuse forced psychiatric treatment sporadically through the 1980s and 1990s. In 1985, human rights activist Mikhail Ardzinov was subjected to two months of groundless psychiatric detention. In June 1999, police sent Ardzinov to Tashkent's main psychiatric clinic during the course of a nine-hour interrogation session. The Uzbek Code of Criminal Procedure allows for persons under investigation for criminal activity to be held in medical institutions under guard for one month. Professor Khusankhojaev reportedly cited a new decree """"on forced psychiatric treatment"""" which came into effect in January 2001, but did not indicate the term for which persons may be held.","Europe/Central Asia, Uzbekistan",""

President Jiang arrives in Havana for a state visit on April 12. The following week, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights is due to consider resolutions condemning human rights abuses in both China and Cuba. Despite their wretched rights records, both countries are voting members of the fifty?three nation Commission, the body charged with monitoring compliance of international human rights norms on behalf of the larger international community.  Human Rights Watch charged both governments with an array of rights abuses, including a widespread pattern of arbitrary detentions and severe restrictions on freedom of expression.  """"The leaders of both countries have something in common that goes beyond trade and economic interests,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Their human rights policies and governing practices are bankrupt in the eyes of the rest of the world.""""  """"In Cuba, President Jiang won't have to worry about Falun Gong protesters, democracy advocates or Catholic church clerics upset about state interference in religious affairs,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"Instead, he'll find a sympathetic ear in Fidel Castro: someone with a distressingly similar agenda on human rights.""""  China's record on freedom of religion is of particular concern to Human Rights Watch, in light of the past year's intensified crackdown on religious activities outside the auspices of the official, state sanctioned churches. In January, the government?sponsored Catholic Church ordained five new bishops without consulting Rome. This was a clear example of deliberate state interference in religious matters. A decree issued by the State Administration of Religious Affairs last fall put into place strict new controls over religious activities of foreigners, including Catholics.  China's underground Catholic church, which pledges its loyalty to Rome, has been under growing pressure to submit to party control. For resisting, in some areas its members often paid a price at the hands of local authorities: harassment, intimidation, interrogation, detention, extortion and fines, and demolition of church buildings.  And in September an eighty-one year old bishop, Zeng Jingmu, was taken into custody by sixty police officers, together with two priests, and later was released. As of the end of the year, several Catholic bishops remained in detention, many of them held for long periods of time. Bishop Su Zhimin disappeared in 1997; his current whereabouts and condition are unknown.  Human Rights Watch noted that Cuba also has a poor record on freedom of religion. Although the government currently permits many more opportunities for religious expression than it did in the past, it still maintains tight control on religious institutions and on individual believers. The Catholic church, which claims over half of Cuba's population as adherents, lacks almost all access to the media, endures strict limits on the numbers of its clergy, and is barred from operating schools.  During his tour of the Latin America, President Jiang plans to visit several other countries on the U.N. Human Rights Commission, including Uruguay, Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. While the latter countries may be more critical of China's human rights practices, China can count on Cuba's vote to keep any debate of the topic off the Commission's schedule. With Cuba also facing possible censure by the Commission, there is clearly a mutually convenient agenda.  """"It is time for both Cuba and China to take concrete steps to move into the 21st century,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.

Khatami, who is widely expected to win should he stand, has complained about his inability to carry out his constitutional duties and mandate for reform because of powerful forces ranged against him.  """"This campaign is beginning to look like a coup designed to deny the reformists electoral success,"""" said Joe Stork, advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is a blatant attempt to stifle free expression and activism for reform in the run-up to the election.""""  This week's arrests follow the previous detention of more than twenty activists in March. In a statement yesterday, President Khatami criticized the detentions, saying that such actions """"boost the climate of intolerance in society.""""  Among those arrested is 80 year old Dr. Seyed Ahmad Sadr Haj Seyed Javadi, a founding member of the Freedom Movement and a prominent legal scholar. A valuable legal archive dating back to the pre-Revolutionary period was removed from his house at the time of his arrest.  The Freedom Movement is a tolerant religious political movement that also emphasizes Iranian nationalism. Although supportive of the Islamic Republic, the party has not been allowed to run for election or operate freely for decades.  The attack on the Freedom Movement comes at a time when its leader, Ebrahim Yazdi, is in the United States undergoing treatment for prostate cancer. The conservative press has long accused the Freedom Movement of foreign ties. For example, the leading conservative newspaper Keyhan carried an article on April 9 questioning the motivations behind Dr. Yazdi's stay in the U.S.  In the course of the raids, security forces ransacked the offices of the Bazargan cultural foundation and the Association of Islamic Engineers. They seized computers and files dating back many years. The Bazargan Foundation, a cultural institution, and the Association of Islamic Engineers were established before the creation of the Freedom Movement. Both institutions are legally registered under Iranian law.

""""Hebron is a microcosm of the devastating impact of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on civilians,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"These widespread human rights abuses simply cannot be deferred to future negotiations.""""  Human Rights Watch urged the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority take immediate steps to stop abuses by the forces under their control, and called for an independent, international monitoring presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to monitor and report on Israeli and Palestinian abuses.  Human Rights Watch researchers spent a total of five weeks in Hebron in November 2000 and February 2001. They completed more than 180 interviews with victims and witnesses to abuses, Israeli and Palestinian officials, international observers, medical and educational personnel, and Israeli settler representatives.  Israeli forces were responsible for the most extensive abuses, the report found, including excessive use of force against unarmed demonstrators, unlawful killings, indiscriminate and disproportionate fire in response to Palestinian attacks, and a consistent failure to protect Palestinians from attacks by Israeli settlers. Israel has restricted Palestinian movement with varying degrees of severity since March 1993, but the curfews and blockades now imposed, are the most extensive to date. These restrictions have had a devastating impact on all aspects of Palestinian life, including education, health, employment, and access to basic necessities. Jewish settlers in Hebron have also been responsible for frequent abuses against Palestinian civilians in Hebron. The Israeli authorities, especially the army, rarely intervene to stop or prevent settler attacks against Palestinians. Settlers in Hebron, who are not subject to the stringent curfew and closure restrictions, regularly beat Palestinians, attack their homes and businesses, and shoot and stone Palestinian drivers. Settlers have also targeted independent observers, humanitarian workers, diplomats and journalists during attacks that largely go unpunished.  Human Rights Watch also found that Palestinian gunmen, including some belonging to President Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement, have frequently targeted Israeli civilians living in settlements or traveling on roads, in violation of international humanitarian law. Although Israeli settlements are illegal under international humanitarian law, Human Rights Watch said, unarmed Israeli settlers, including children, are civilians and attacks on them are prohibited under international humanitarian law. Palestinian gunmen also put Palestinian civilians at risk by firing at Israeli targets from heavily populated Palestinian neighborhoods.

""""But we've seen this combination before: high-level visits to Latin American to get allies for the Commission, together with the release of a report which boasts that China's human rights record has never been better."""" The current session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission opened on March 19;  China's rights record is expected to be discussed later this month. The new White Paper, issued by Beijing Monday, highlights: improvements in the general standard of living and in """"people's rights to subsistence and development"""" at a time when the collapse of rural education and healthcare programs has been of growing concern. the guarantee of citizens' political rights, at a time when controls on freedom of association, assembly, and expression, already tight, are tightening further. The recent arrests of Chinese scholars resident abroad and Falun Gong members are a case in point. China's efforts to ensure an impartial judiciary, when the politicization and party control of the courts is a constant of the Chinese legal system. protection of women and children's rights, after a much publicized explosion in a school in Jiangxi province where children were illegally making firecrackers caused the deaths of 41 people. equal rights and special protection for ethnic minorities at a time when efforts to establish schools for Uighur children led to the arrest of a prominent Uighur businesswoman, and Tibetan cultural institutions are under constant surveillance from state authorities. China's """"positive attitude toward carrying out international cooperation in human rights"""" at a time when it systematically flouts some of the most important provisions of the human rights treaties it has ratified (e.g. the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights) and signed (the International Covenant on Political and Civil Rights). The first Chinese White Paper on Human Rights was published in November 1991, while the memories of Tiananmen Square were still fresh, and pressure was building toward a resolution on China at the 1992 Commission. Another White Paper was published in March 1997, reviewing China's human rights achievements in 1996, and another in February 1998. There is also a precedent for high-level visits to Latin America just before the Commission. Of the six countries on President Jiang Zemin's current itinerary -- Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Cuba, and Venezuela -- all but Chile are members of the current Commission. Some of these countries might be inclined to join with the United States, if not in sponsoring a resolution, then in trying to defeat China's efforts to ensure it will not come to a vote. In late 1995, with a view to the 1996 Commission session, senior Chinese officials embarked on a series of high-level exchanges with Latin American leaders, and then Premier Li Peng went to Peru and Mexico. Before the 1997 Commission, Li Peng visited two key Commission countries, Brazil and Chile, and China's senior trade official, Wu Yi, visited six Latin American countries, all but one of which were to be members of the 1997 Commission.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Challenge on Rights Abuses","European Union Should Press for Reforms","04/05/2001","The Syrian government is erroneously claiming to United Nations experts that it has complied with the provisions of a major human rights treaty. The U.N. Human Rights Committee is expected to make public its assessment of Syria's human rights performance by April 6.  On March 30, the U.N. Human Rights Committee examined Syria's long-overdue report on its compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The head of the Syrian government's delegation, Dr. Abboud Sarraj, told the committee that reports of extrajudicial executions, """"disappearances,"""" and torture were """"totally, categorically unfounded.""""  """"In fact, the evidence of human rights abuse in Syria could not be more clear,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Syrian government must account for the horrors of the past, such as torture, extrajudicial executions and massacres.""""  Syria is a state party to the ICCPR, a bedrock international treaty that guarantees fundamental human rights.  Human Rights Watch called on the European Union, which is negotiating an Association Agreement with Syria, to set benchmarks for human rights improvements and to insist that Syria lift the state of emergency.  The state of emergency has been in effect continuously since March 1963. It grants exceptional and broad powers to the interior minister and has facilitated massive rights abuses by security forces, including arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detention, """"disappearances,"""" unexplained deaths in custody, and long-term detention without charge or trial.  Tens of thousands of victims and their families have been effectively silenced, with no effective means to seek judicial remedy, redress, or compensation, Human Rights Watch said.  The trials of hundreds of nonviolent political opponents before the state security court have been grossly unfair and not in compliance with provisions of the ICCPR, including the right to appeal decisions to a higher tribunal.  """"The new Syrian government should act now to guarantee the right to freedom of association and private or public assembly,"""" Megally said. """"Independent political parties cannot seek legal status and operate freely at the present time.""""  In its March 30 testimony, the Syrian government did not offer substantive responses to questions about discrimination in law and practice against women and the Kurdish minority. Dr. Sarraj told the committee that all information about discrimination against the Kurds """"is erroneous and not valid at all.""""  The government also did not explain the legal process under which Lebanese and other nationals in Lebanon have been secretly transferred to Syria and held in detention there. Several experts raised the issue of Lebanese known or believed to be """"disappeared"""" in Syria, and the government replied that """"there is not a single Lebanese detainee or prisoner in Syria.""""  The European Union is in the process of negotiating an Association Agreement with Syria, and Damascus is also seeking European aid to finance a ten-year, $5.66 billion industrial development plan. Article 2 of every Association Agreement states that the agreement is premised on respect for human rights and democratic freedoms.  """"The European Union has a very important role to play here,"""" Megally said. """"Lifting of the state of emergency and guaranteeing basic civil and political rights, like freedom of association and assembly, should be part of any deal the EU makes with Syria.""""  The next round of negotiations between the EU and Syria is set for April 23 in Damascus. EU Commissioner Romano Prodi said earlier this year that a final agreement could be signed before the end of 2001.  ***  The U.N. Human Rights Committee's consideration of the report of the government of Syria took place during the Human Rights Committee's 71st session, held in New York from March 19 to April 6. Under article 40 of the ICCPR, all States parties agree to submit periodic reports on the implementation of the covenant. Syria's report, its second since becoming a state party, was due in 1984, but was not submitted to the committee until 16 years later, on January 19, 2000.

Commission on Human Rights","","04/05/2001","In early February Human Rights Watch wrote to Members of U.N. Commission on Human Rights urging that your government support a new resolution on Chechnya at the current session. Tuesday, April 10, is the final day for tabling such a resolution, and we are writing once again to underscore how critical it is for your government to cosponsor a resolution that deplores the serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law that continue on a routine basis, as well as the Russian government's utter non-compliance with the terms of last year's resolution. Prior to the opening of the Commission, some argued that it would be best to negotiate a chairman's statement with the Russians. Even advocates of this position, however, predicted that the Russians would never agree to a chairman's statement that would be even remotely accurate in its description of the grave human rights abuses being committed by Russian forces in Chechnya or that would call for effective, concrete action to hold the worst abusers accountable.  From the outset, Human Rights Watch feared that any document negotiated with Russia would be an empty gesture that would not contribute to an improvement to the human rights situation on the ground. The draft statement that has been circulated informally by the European Union has confirmed our worst fears. It is a weak text that fails to condemn the severe violations of the Geneva Conventions being committed on a daily basis by Russian forces in Chechnya. Nor does it even acknowledge Russia's year-long refusal to comply with any of the key requirements of last year's resolution; in fact, the draft statement does not even mention last year's resolution. It is a disservice to those who worked hard to draft and cosponsor the resolution last year, to the Commission, and to the values it represents.  We understand that a draft resolution is being prepared and may be deposited by Tuesday 1:00 p.m. (Geneva time). Should a resolution be tabled, we urge you immediately to deposit your signature as a cosponsor and to work for its adoption. Given the ongoing atrocities being committed by Russian forces in Chechnya-including torture, summary executions, and forced disappearances-as well as the absolute failure of the Russian government to comply with any of the key provisions of last year's resolution, the resolution should:  Condemn ongoing human rights and humanitarian law violations in Chechnya; note the total failure on the part of the Russian government to implement the CHR's previous resolution; note the inadequacy of the domestic prosecutorial efforts; establish an international commission of inquiry that is mandated to investigate and document atrocities committed by both sides to the conflict in Chechnya. Such an international commission should be impartial and independent and operate in a manner consistent with the general principles outlined by High Commissioner Mary Robinson in her April 2000 background note on national commissions of inquiry.  Your government was a cosponsor of last year's resolution, which represented the broadest consensus among international actors that impunity would not be countenanced in Chechnya. One year later, there can be no question that the Russian government has blatantly defied the Commission: there have not been effective domestic prosecutions, no national commission of inquiry has been established, and because of this ongoing environment of impunity, many serious abuses continue to be perpetrated on a daily basis. In the face of this blatant non-compliance, it is inconceivable that the Commission would respond with something as weak and inaccurate as the draft chairman's statement.  We urge your government to make clear that a chairman's statement is simply not acceptable and that a strong resolution is the only appropriate response to the scope and gravity of the abuses being perpetrated by Russian federal forces and tolerated by the Russian government.

Honor crimes are acts of violence, usually murder, committed by male family members against female family members who are perceived to have brought dishonor upon the family. The ramifications of this impunity for women are significant. For example, a woman in an abusive marriage must make the choice to stay in the marriage and hope that the violence will end, or leave the marriage and hope that neither her husband nor any male relatives will kill her. A women who is raped, even if she can prove that she was a victim of sexual violence, may be killed by her husband, father, son, brother or cousin.  Honor crimes are not specific to any religion, nor are they limited to any one region of the world. Human Rights Watch has worked on this issue in the Americas, Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa. Although there is increased awareness of this issue, states remain reluctant to take the necessary steps to end impunity for honor killings. For example, although the Supreme Court of Brazil struck down """"defense of honor"""" as a justification for murder of a wife in 1991, ten years later, courts still fail to prosecute and convict men who claim they kill their wives because of their alleged infidelity.  In Jordan, if a woman seeks protection from the police because she fears that her family wants to kill her, she will be held in indefinite detention in a local prison. It is important to note that once a woman has sought protection from the government and has been placed in prison, she is prohibited according to the government's policy from leaving the prison even though she has committed no crime. Ironically, women can only be released into the custody of a family member -- perhaps the very persons trying to kill them. If these women are killed, they are buried in unmarked graves and their very existence denied.  Honor crimes are a clear violation of women's human rights and states are bound to protect women from such violations. Nonetheless, in many countries, honor crimes are either condoned through government inaction or defended as legitimate cultural practices. As a result, police fail to investigate these crimes and prosecutions are non-existent. In the rare cases where a man in prosecuted, it is the woman's behavior that becomes the focus of the trial, not the culpability of the defendant. In the even rarer case that a man is found guilty, the man's claim that it was a crime committed to restore family honor allows the courts to reduce the sentence.  Human Rights Watch calls on the Commission on Human Rights to condemn all forms of violence against women and to uniformly reject all attempts by states to justify any acts of violence against women as legitimate or defensible. Human Rights Watch also calls on the appropriate special mechanisms to expose how pervasive discrimination against women creates the climate in which violence against women flourishes. Women who suffer from routine discrimination based on their sex that leaves them impoverished and illiterate are ill equipped to challenge the practices that allow honor killings to continue. It is the responsibility of states to end discrimination both in law and in practice. It is the responsibility of states to prevent violence against women, and when they have failed to prevent the violence, to ensure redress. But as women from around that world can testify, the violence continues.  Thank you.","Global","Women's Rights"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/04/04/turkey-isolation-prisoners-condemned","Turkey- Isolation of Prisoners Condemned","Turkey: Isolation of Prisoners Condemned","Allegations of deliberate killing, torture and rape by gendarmes","04/04/2001","The Turkish government must bring an end to the isolation regime in the new high security prisons and investigate reports of torture and other abuses by gendarmes during the December transfer. More than 300 prisoners have been on an extended hunger strike to protest the isolation regime in the new """"F-type"""" prisons, and many are believed to be near death.  Human Rights Watch today submitted a 23-page memorandum to the Turkish government documenting abuses committed by gendarmes during the transfer operation, which cost the lives of thirty prisoners in December 2000. The memorandum also documented the ongoing isolation and ill-treatment of prisoners in the new prisons.  """"The isolation regime in F-type prisons is physically and psychologically damaging to prisoners and should never have been instituted in the first place,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The government should not wait for more prisoners to die before it brings the prison into compliance with international norms.""""  On December 19, 2000, thirty prisoners and two gendarmes were killed when ten thousand armed soldiers entered twenty Turkish prisons to break up a nonviolent protest by inmates and transfer them to the newly constructed F-type prisons. Prisoners reported excessive force, deliberate killings, and torture by gendarmes during the operation and have presented medical evidence-including of head wounds, broken limbs, and ribs-to support their claims. Several prisoners transferred to Kandira F-type prison also made a formal complaint that they had been anally raped with a truncheon by gendarmes. No medical examination was conducted until weeks after the alleged rape, by which time evidence of the assault would have disappeared. No charges have yet been brought for the alleged rape.  """"There is a long history of gendarmes using excessive force in Turkish prisons, and many prisoners have died as a result,"""" said Cartner. """"It is high time the government conducted a serious investigation into these allegations of abuse.""""  Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the isolation regime in place in these new prisons. At the four F-type prisons that are currently in operation-at Edirne, Kandira, Sincan, and Tekirdag-prisoners may leave their cells only once a week if a member of their immediate family visits. Otherwise, they are held permanently either in single-person or three-person cells in what has been termed """"small group isolation."""" These new cell-based facilities are a stark contrast to the large ward-based system that is typical in older Turkish prisons.  Human Rights Watch emphasized that the F-type regime contravenes international prison standards and has been criticized by intergovernmental bodies such as the Council of Europe. Paradoxically the persistence of isolation contradicts the Turkish government's own stated policy. Prior to the December operation, the Turkish Justice Minister stated that the new F-type prisons would not be opened until legislation was in place to ensure a humane regime. The minister now refuses to implement those reforms unless prisoners abandon their protest hunger strikes.  One hunger striker at Ankara's Sincan F-type prison died on March 22, and further deaths are expected in the forthcoming days. According to official figures, 305 prisoners on hunger strike have accepted only salt, sugar, water, and vitamins-some for more than five months; 122 have been hospitalized with symptoms of advanced malnutrition, including loss of vision, hearing and memory, numbness, vomiting, and diarrhea. The prisoners are protesting against being permanently locked down in their three-person units  Human Rights Watch first addressed the Turkish government in a July 1999 memorandum warning that the planned regime of small group isolation might amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment, and would expose prisoners to an increased risk of ill-treatment or torture.  Human Rights Watch also documented how the Turkish government has methodically silenced critics of its prison policies. Journalists and human rights defenders who have criticized the handling of the F-type prison transfers and reported on the progress of the hunger strikes have been ill-treated, detained, imprisoned, and prosecuted. Newspapers and magazines that have reported on the prison crisis have been confiscated and broadcasts suspended. Branches of the Turkish Human Rights Association have been closed down, and officials charged with """"supporting illegal armed groups."""" Prisoners' relatives have also been persecuted and subjected to routine humiliation during prison visits.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

A record ten human rights defenders were killed in 2000. Even as eyewitnesses, municipal officials, and even the government's own investigators deliver current information about the location of paramilitary bases, license plates, colors and types of vehicles, cellular telephones numbers, and even the names of paramilitaries, the government's response is usually only a letter acknowledging receipt. Military troops arrive after paramilitaries have gone, and register bodies and damages. Indeed, high ranking officers against whom there is credible evidence of ties to paramilitary groups not only remain in command, but have been promoted. These cases are not the exception, but the rule.  In only the first seventeen days of 2001, the Colombian government recorded twenty-three massacres. The worst took place in Chengue, Sucre. An estimated fifty paramilitaries pulled men from their homes and killed them by crushing their heads with heavy stones and a sledgehammer. The military, according to credible accounts, provided safe passage to the paramilitary column and effectively sealed off the area while the killing took place.  Guerrillas also committed violations of international humanitarian law, among them killings, the taking of hostages, and the recruitment of children. In dozens of attacks, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia used indiscriminate weapons like gas cylinder bombs that caused avoidable civilian casualties. For their part, Camilist Union-National Liberation Army guerrillas continued attacks on oil pipelines and power pylons, and for prolonged periods prevented transit on vital roads, converting thousands of detained travelers into human shields.  Mr. Chairman, HRW believes the Commission must take strong action on Indonesia. In particular, like many of our Indonesian colleagues, we call on the Commission to address continuing military impunity in Indonesia.  Indonesia's democratically elected government has taken important steps to bring its laws into line with international rights standards. Many of the new laws, however, are untested: the courts are still weak and slow to act, and hardliners in the military and government continue to impede efforts to do justice for past atrocities. Meanwhile, reports of new atrocities continue to emerge, particularly against civilians in conflict zones.  In Aceh and Irian Jaya (Papua), rights defenders and political activists continue to come under attack. The most recent example of continuing human rights crimes comes from South Aceh, where three men, including a human rights lawyer and a religious leader involved in conflict resolution efforts, were killed on March 29, 2001. The perpetrators have not been identified, but circumstantial evidence suggests that state security forces may have been involved. In another case in Aceh, three aid workers providing care to torture victims were abducted and shot execution-style in December 2000. In the latter case, evidence of military involvement is overwhelming but just last week four key suspects were reported to have escaped from detention. While the murder of human rights defenders continues to go unpunished, Indonesian authorities have revived discredited colonial-era laws to jail leaders of peaceful civilian movements. In Aceh, this includes Mohammad Nazar, head of SIRA, a group that supports a referendum on Aceh's political status. In Irian Jaya (Papua), political detainees include over a dozen community leaders and students.  Despite the continuing abuses, Indonesian reformers have been able to enact signficant legislation which warrants international support, including a new law establishing human rights courts. Investigation in one key case -- the December 2000 torture of dozens and death in custody of two Papuan students -- has begun. In another positive step, Indonesia's parliament on March 21, 2001 approved the establishment of ad hoc courts to prosecute past human rights crimes in East Timor in 1999 and Tanjung Priok in 1984.  These are important first steps, but success is by no means assured and prosecutions could still be derailed. Commission members should take this opportunity to denounce continued military impunity and to support nascent justice efforts in Indonesia.  Thank you.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Human Rights Watch research found that Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels are raping, killing and abducting Sierra Leonean refugees fleeing desperate conditions in refugee camps in Guinea. The findings raise serious questions about the viability of so-called """"safe passage"""" or humanitarian corridors through rebel territory for returning refugees, as proposed in February by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).   Human Rights Watch documented abuses against refugees from December 2000 through mid-March 2001 in the Koinadugu, Kailahun and Kono districts of eastern Sierra Leone. It said RUF soldiers are attacking returnees in Sierra Leone as they trek for days, and sometimes weeks, in an attempt to reach the government-held towns of Kenema, Kabala and Daru.   """"The so-called ‘safe passage' for refugees is far from safe,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Africa division. """"The United Nations must not lend its authority to a scheme that will only mean more suffering for traumatized refugees.""""   The returning Sierra Leonean refugees have been under siege in refugee camps in Guinea since September 2000, when cross-border attacks flared between Sierra Leonean, Guinean, and Liberian government forces, rebels, and militia groups. The Guinean government estimates that hundreds have died in this border violence, and that over 100,000 Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees and thousands of Guineans have been displaced.   The recently appointed U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Ruud Lubbers, visited the sub-region in February 2001, to assess the refugee crisis described by UNHCR as the worst in the world. After meetings with the leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, he proposed relocating the refugees to camps further within Guinea. Lubbers also suggested a strategy of """"safe passage,"""" allowing refugees to return to Sierra Leone both overland through RUF territory and by boat from the Guinean capital of Conakry to Sierra Leone's government-controlled capital, Freetown. UNHCR established contact with the RUF to seek a commitment to allow the """"safe passage"""" of refugees.   Since early February, tens of thousands of refugees have been relocated from the border region by UNHCR. According to UNHCR, as of March 23, 2001, some 59,000 Sierra Leonean refugees had returned from Guinea to Sierra Leone since September 2000, many of them of their own accord. Some 40,000 have returned by boat from Conakry, and some 13,000 by foot to Lungi, north of Freetown. Some 5,000 are believed to have passed through RUF-held areas of Sierra Leone. However, more than 135,000 are still stranded in the Guinean refugee camps located in the Parrot's Beak region bordering RUF-held areas of Sierra Leone. These camps remain vulnerable to attack, largely cut off from food assistance and protection.   Based on its findings of continuing RUF brutality against returning refugees, Human Rights Watch believes that the protection of refugees would be seriously compromised if UNHCR goes ahead with plans to establish """"safe passage"""" through RUF territory. Despite assurances received by UNHCR during its meetings with RUF leaders in Sierra Leone, any form of overland travel by refugees through RUF territory should be discouraged by UNHCR.   Instead, UNHCR should make as its priority the protection and relocation of the refugees to more secure camps further inland within Guinea. Refugees should be provided with full and objective information on which to base decisions about return, and those who wish to return should be assisted with transport to Conakry where they can safely return by boat to Freetown.   The international community, including UNHCR, should provide assistance to returning refugees, many of whom join the already over-crowded camps for displaced persons around Freetown.   Among the scores of returnees who gave detailed accounts of serious rebel abuses to Human Rights Watch, numerous men who passed through the diamond-rich district of Kono and the rebel stronghold of Kailahun described recruitment of able-bodied men and boys as young as fifteen to fight with the RUF forces or to carry out forced labor in the diamond mines or with the rebel army. Four men were killed for refusing recruitment, disobeying orders, or being physically unable to work. Human Rights Watch interviewed an elderly woman whose twenty-five-year-old son was shot and killed in front of her in December 2000, after refusing to be recruited. A woman described how her husband was executed in early December for refusing to hand her over to the rebels, while another woman described how her ailing husband was beaten to death in the mid-March 2001 for no apparent reason.   Numerous women returnees described being abducted, raped and/or sexually abused. Human Rights Watch interviewed six women who had been raped and numerous more who were either held or taken away to rebel bases, for a time span varying from a few hours to several weeks. One woman described how she was gang-raped by RUF rebels in Kailahun in late January 2001, after she and five other women were chosen from a group of returnees detained at a rebel checkpoint. Human Rights Watch interviewed a man who managed to escape in mid-January after two weeks of forced labor, but had to leave his wife behind in a rebel base in Kono.   According to witnesses, the RUF routinely screened returnees, and sometimes forced them to move to other locations where they were pressured to settle within rebel territory. Returnees who had been detained described being held for anywhere from several hours to several weeks. In addition to the abuses suffered along the way, most refugees described being robbed of some or all of their possessions.   Fuller testimonies of refugee victims of RUF abuses:   Thirty year old Mani, who suffers from a speech impediment, had traveled from Katkama camp in Guinea to Soardu camp, closer to the border, in search of food. In late February he decided to leave Guinea and crossed into Sierra Leone's Kono District. He encountered the rebels in the town of Gbamandu and described what happened:  """"I traveled with six other men and three women when we met a large group of rebels. They accused us of supporting Tejan Kabbah from Guinea. Many of them then took the three women into the forest. The women had their clothes on. We were pleading to be released. Five came up to me and said that I was useless to them, because I am not well. They tied my ankles to my hands and started hitting me with their guns and boots. It all took a long time and my head was spinning, but I can remember seeing the women again coming back from the forest with the rebels. They were naked and their eyes were red and running, and I saw that they had some scratches on their bodies. They then left with the others and left me behind, unable to move. After lying there for three days, my relatives found me. They put me on a wheelbarrow and brought me here. I still can't walk because of the beating.""""  Sixty-seven year old Kumba left Nyaedou camp with her eldest son Sahr and crossed into Markor, Kono district late February 2001. She was beaten and they arrested her eldest son, whom she hasn't seen since. She explained:  """"We met them [the rebels] at a checkpoint. They took our luggage and they told me that they would beat me, because old people tell their children not to cross the border. They pushed me to the ground and hit me three times on my back with the butt of a gun. My son Sahr ran up to me and tried to stop them. They immediately arrested him and tied his hands to his feet. They told him that they would deal with him later. I managed to get up and I fled into the bush. The last thing I saw was that two of them lifted Sahr by the arms and carried him away. I haven't seen him since.""""  Fatmata, thirty-seven, fled Nongoa camp in the Parrot's Beak region of Guinea with her husband and baby shortly after the camp was attacked on March 9. At Manowa in Kailahun, Sierra Leone, the RUF detained a large group of some sixty returnees. The rebels then targeted her ailing husband. Fatmata described what happened:  """"My husband was very sick when we crossed the border into Kailahun. His eyes and fingernails were yellow. All of us were told to sit on the ground and wait, while armed rebels were all around us. Four rebels then came up to my husband and told him to stand up and run. He stood up, but they knew that he could not run. Then they started beating and kicking him and said that they would continue for as long as he would not obey their orders. One of them was in his late twenties. The other three boys were very young, around seventeen. It did not take long. He bled from his nose and mouth and did not move anymore. They said that if one of us would touch his body, that person would be dealt with in the same way. None of us said a word. We were kept there the rest of the day and the following night. Nobody moved. We received some water but no food. Then the next morning, they let all of us go. I left my husband's body behind, which had been lying there all that time.""""  Due to food shortages in the refugee camps, thirty-year-old Princess and her family decided in mid-January to leave Nyaedou camp and travel back to Sierra Leone. After stopping over in the Koloma camp in the Parrot's Beak, they crossed into Kailahun district. After being stopped by the RUF, she was selected with five other women of the same age, taken into the bush and gang raped by five rebels. After one week, they were allowed to pass through. She narrated her ordeal:  """"We had traveled from Nyaedou camp to a few other camps in Guinea to flee from rebel attacks and to find food. Finally we left Kolomba camp mid January and crossed the border into Gelema, Kailahun. The same day we met armed rebels there, some ten in number. We were with around thirty people, including my husband and two sons. Rebels took our property right away, then they walked up to me and told me to come. They pointed out five other women. They said that they were not going to kill us, but that they were going to use us until they would be satisfied. They also said that they wanted peace, but that they would not let us go for nothing. Then all six of us were taken deep into the forest by five of them, while our husbands stayed in Gelema town. They said that we would not escape, since our relatives were still in Gelema town. Then deeper into the forest, all of them raped me, one after the other, it did not take long. When they were finished with me, they told me to go. I found my way back to town and found my husband and youngest son, but I was told that my ten-year old son Vandy was missing. I haven't seen him since. I met the other women in town later that evening. The only thing they said is that they [the rebels] had done the same to them as they had done to me. The rebels did not allow us to leave, but they gave us water and cassava to eat, and left us alone. There were no commanders among them in Gelema town. After one week we were allowed to pass through. But my son was still missing.""""  Thirty-five year old Sia who had been staying in Katkama camp, north of Gueckedou, in Guinea, was abducted and raped by RUF rebels after crossing the border at the end of December 2000. She was taken to Koidu town together with some twenty-five returnees, while her husband was forced to stay behind with other rebels. She described her ordeal:  """"We were with some thirty refugees in our group. All of us were arrested by armed rebels at Kamanjendoh, after they had taken most of our belongings. Some three days later we were taken to another village. There they separated the married men from the women and the unmarried young men. I was in a group of sixteen women and some ten young men. Our husbands were forced to stay behind with other rebels. We were told that we had to join them to become their wives, that we would leave for Koidu. While we were taken away, my son was crying for his father, I was the only woman carrying children. We had traveled for a few days when we arrived in Koidu, this was early January. There the men were taken away somewhere else while the women were put into a big house. After a few days, some men came in with clothes and cooking materials. The man who gave me the items was callied Sorie. He told me that I would be his wife. The next day he took me and my children to his house, where he raped me the same day. I had no choice since I was afraid for my children, but he treated them well. After two days, nine of the women of my group came by at night and told me to join them. The other six stayed behind because they were too afraid to escape. We managed to leave Koidu and traveled through the bush until we reached Kenema. On the way, the other women told me that they were not raped but beaten since they refused. They were older than me. My children and me are here now, but I am worried about my husband.""""  Fifty-year-old Kumba left Katkama camp on December l0. She traveled with her husband and four children for several days through Kono district in Sierra Leone, until they met a group of rebels in Tongoma town. She described what happened to her twenty-five year-old son Sahr:  """"The rebels were many in Tongoma, they carried guns and wore combat trousers. They took our shoes and clothes, some of us were stripped down to our underwear. Then they surrounded my eldest son, Sahr Allieu, and told him that they were going to train him how to fight. Sahr told them that he would refuse to be trained. They argued for a short while, and then one of the rebels shot him from behind in the head. The rebels around him scattered and my family and I went up to Sahr in distress. He was dead. The bullet came out in the front. We stayed there to bury my son, but most refugees were allowed to pass through after their belongings were taken away. While burying Sahr, the rebels dropped the body of another man next to Sahr's body. We had to bury that man as well. His name was Tamba [also a refugee]. I knew him because he was the son of an old lady I knew from Kono. Besides Sahr and Tamba, I saw two more dead bodies that day in Tongoma town.""""  Twenty-nine year old Njama left Katkama camp in Guinea and crossed into Kono with her husband and two children at the end of November 2000. In early December, they arrived at Kamanjendoh, where the returnees of their group were detained and the young men and women separated from the elderly. Njama's husband refused to be separated, she described what happened:  """"At Kamanjendoh, all of us were put in a house where the rebels selected the young men and the young women. The two groups were separated by a mat. They told the young men in our group that they would be trained. They then choose the women they preferred who would cook for them. We, the women who came with a husband, were told to forget about them, because we were with them [the rebels] now. My husband became upset when they separated us. He told them that he was legally married to me and that nobody would stop him from being together with me. I could hear them arguing. My husband was angry with them for doing this to us. The next morning, early, I just heard one gunshot. Some refugees who had been washing at the river ran up to me and told me that they had killed my husband. I went to the back of the house to where the sound came from. He was there, they had shot him in the chest because he had argued with them. They warned me not to cry for I would be killed too. My husband's name was Kai Sam, he was in his thirties. One rebel felt sorry for me. He was also a Kono by tribe, just like me. My husband was also a Kono. He wrote me a letter to help me pass through the other checkpoints. A few days later, I sent my children into the bush to fetch water. They understood, and I followed soon after. I arrived here in this camp [in Freetown] at the end of February.""""  Finda, twenty-five years, left Baladu camp, north of Gueckedou, with her three children at the end of January. She was arrested with over twenty other refugees at Jagbwema, Kono district. She described:  """"They [the rebels] were ten in number. They took our luggage from us and split the group in two. Five young boys from the group were separated and the rebels said they were going to mine. Two of the boys were around twenty years, the other three were somewhere between twelve and sixteen. I don't know what happened to them. That night they [the rebels] discussed what to do with the rest of the group. We could hear them talking about the message they had sent to ‘Burkina Faso', which is a base just behind Gandorhun (Kono). The message was about whether they should take us along or release us. Than we heard that more troops were on their way. That made us so afraid that we planned to escape. That same night, many of us managed to get out through the bushes.""""  Bintu, twenty-seven years, fled Masakondou camp, with many other refugees. In early February on their way to Sierra Leone, they were stopped by RUF rebels at the border town of Dangadu. Bintu described how she was raped by two RUF rebels.  """"We came in by truck, some forty of us. We met the rebels at Dangadu, which is at the border with Kono but still in Guinea. There we had to offload. Most refugees had to strip naked and we were searched. They took most of our property, even the clothes of my children I was carrying. Then two of them came up to me and held me. I resisted and pointed at my husband, telling them I was married. They went up to him and tied him up. Then they took me off the road far into the bush. I was carrying my seven months old baby on my back. Inside the bush, they took the baby of my back and pushed me to the ground. They said that they would deal with the refugees today. Then they raped me in turns. It lasted for a couple of hours, after that, they let me go. I picked up my baby and went back to the road where I met my husband. Everyone else was gone, I don't know where to. We left for Koquima, which is some 50 miles from Dangadu. It took us 15 days to reach the hospital in Koquima. I was in pain so we could only travel for a few miles per day.""""  Twenty-nine year old Sia left Baladu camp on the December 6. The next day, she crossed through Koardu, into Kono with her family, where they encountered a large group of RUF rebels. She described what happened then:  """"All our bags were searched. They took property from us, and told the men not to move. Then they took us, some thirty women, away under gunpoint to the village of Koardu. Once there, one of them called me into the bush. He told me to come with him to collect my belongings, which would be returned to me. When I was close to him, he grabbed me by force and took me into the forest. If I would scream he said he would kill me. He raped me once, then I was let go. When I arrived at the village again, the other women had left already, but I managed to join them further down the road. My children were with them. None of us decided to go back to where we had left our husbands. We had no choice but to move on. On the way, we talked about what had happened to us. A number of women spoke about being raped, just like what they did to me. I can't exactly tell how many but it was more than five. Others complained about the loss of their belongings. All of us went to Koidu, which was a two-day-walk. My father, who lives in Koidu, took me to Freetown to get a medical check-up. I was treated in Connaught hospital. My husband is still missing.""""  Kadiatu, thirty-two-years, left Kissidougou town in Guinea in early January. She crossed the border into Koinadugu district with some thirty refugees. On their way to Kabala, they met rebels who screened the returnees; looking for Guineans and weapons. Kadiatu and at least one other woman from their group were screened separately from the others and gang-raped. She narrated her ordeal:  """"All of us arrived at Dankawali checkpoint where rebels told us to stand in line. They were checking whether there were any Guineans among us. They checked our properties and took whatever they could use. They occupied an old school building and asked the women in, one by one. A woman name Fati was called in before me. It took a long time before she came out. Then it was my turn. There were five men inside the room. One of them lifted up my skirt to see whether they liked my thighs. They found my legs smooth. They said that they needed me to have a good time, and ripped my clothes of. The first one who was called, ‘Hold Me Cap', raped me three times while he was asking all kinds of questions about Guinea. He told me not to worry since they [the rebels] would retaliate. Then the second raped me twice. He was called ‘Lebanese'.I started to feel pain so I offered the third one the little money I had left so he would stop after one time. The fourth man asked me what tribe I was. He then said that he would use me only once since he had a good friend who was a Temne by tribe, just like me. By the time the last one used me, I was dizzy and in a lot of pain. I hardly reacted anymore and I think he noticed because he did it slow to me and got up after a few minutes and left. I was released but could barely walk. All of us were released the same day and were told to move on. In the next village, Fati was complaining about pain in her abdomen. Then of course I knew. There was no chance to hide it from each other. I have a painful infection ever since during that day.""""","Africa, Guinea, Sierra Leone","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Sexual Violence and Rape"

These scholars have been held over the past few months without adequate explanation of the reasons for their detention or adequate opportunity for them to defend themselves. The mystery surrounding the conditions of these scholars' detention will likely deter other academics from freely pursuing their research in and about China for fear of suffering the same treatment. Such an occurrence would have grave negative impacts on China's future social and academic development. We urge you to ensure that the internationally recognized human rights of these scholars are protected and that they are immediately released in the absence of clear evidence of criminal activity under internationally accepted standards:  Dr. Xu Zerong, who holds a Ph.D. from Oxford University, was detained last fall, although to date the authorities have not presented any information regarding any charges against him. Dr. Xu's family has stated that they still do not know where he is being held, and he has not been allowed to speak with a lawyer, in contravention of China's judicial procedures. Dr. Xu was active in sociological research and publishing the Chinese Social Sciences Quarterly in Hong Kong before he returned to the mainland to assume positions as an associate research professor at Guangdong Provincial Academy of Social Sciences and an affiliated professor at Zhongshan University.  Professor Li Shaomin, who teaches business at the City University of Hong Kong, was detained on February 25 while on his way to visit Shenzhen. At this writing, the authorities have not stated why he was arrested. Prof. Li, a U.S. citizen for the last six years, is a much-published sociologist whose work focuses on the issues involved in China's privatizing economy and on the impact and use of advertising in China. Prof. Li received his Ph.D. in sociology from Princeton University in 1988, and was a post-doctoral fellow at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for East Asian Research. He also worked closely with several major western corporations interested in doing business in China. He frequently traveled between Hong Kong and mainland China, where he operates a commercial website in Shenzhen dedicated to internet advertising in China.  Dr. Gao Zhan, a research scholar based at American University in Washington, D.C., was detained last month and was recently publicly accused by the Chinese Foreign Ministry of spying for unspecified """"overseas intelligence agencies."""" Although authorities have stated that she has confessed to these charges, to date the government has not offered any evidence to support this charge. Her husband, Xue Donghua, who was also detained without charge and later released, has strenuously denied the allegations. The couple's five-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, was separated from his parents for 26 days without any notification to U.S. authorities, in contravention of clear international law. Dr. Gao's academic work focuses on foreign students, especially women, who return to China after a period abroad.  China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on October 1998, thus committing itself to strive to provide all individuals the right to be free from """"arbitrary arrest or detention,"""" and to guarantee all the """"freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds."""" The ongoing detention of these scientists violates these fundamental rights.  We respectfully urge your government to demonstrate its commitment to protecting and promoting academic freedom in China by either immediately releasing the detained scientists, or by promptly affording them the opportunity to defend themselves against formal charges in a court of law following international standards of due process.

Milosevic's April 1 arrest is a welcome step, Human Rights Watch said, but does not constitute """"cooperation"""" with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, as required by U.S. law.  Last October, the U.S. Congress set out clear conditions for continuing some $100 million in U.S. aid to Yugoslavia, with March 31 as the cut-off date. Approximately $50 million remains to be dispersed. The U.S. law requiring termination is tied chiefly to the Yugoslav authorities' cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.  """"The decision to certify is premature,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"This is not the moment to let the pressure off Belgrade. Slobodan Milosevic would not be behind bars today if it were not for international pressure.""""  Cartner said that the Bush administration was correct in deciding to withhold support for a donors' conference of major international lenders to Belgrade until the Yugoslav government has exhibited real cooperation with the tribunal. But the administration should lay out specific benchmarks, including the transfer of Milosevic and other indictees to the tribunal, in order for the donors' conference to go ahead. She also urged the U.S. administration to link future support in international financial institutions to the transfer of indictees, including Milosevic, to The Hague.  Although Serbian police arrested and transferred one indictee, Bosnian Serb Milomir Stakic, to The Hague on March 22, 2001, at least eight other persons indicted by the war crimes court are currently believed to be living in Serbia. In addition to Milosevic, these include four former Serbian and Yugoslav officials who were indicted along with Milosevic for crimes against humanity in Kosovo in early 1999, as well as three Yugoslav Army officials indicted on charges relating to the capture of Vukovar in Croatia in November 1991. Yet, with the exception of Milosevic's arrest on corruption charges, the authorities in Belgrade have failed to arrest any of the eight, and not one has been surrendered to the tribunal.  Cartner noted that the authorities in Belgrade have finally taken some initial steps to improve relations with The Hague tribunal, but said they had not yet produced the serious cooperation required by the letter and spirit of the law.  There are clear splits over cooperation with the tribunal between some in the Serbian government and the president of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Vojislav Kostunica. Although several Serbian government representatives have spoken out in favor of cooperation, Kostunica himself has repeatedly denigrated the tribunal and even publicly opposed the one transfer of Stakic to The Hague.  In his opposition to the tribunal, President Kostunica has not only openly questioned the legitimacy of The Hague tribunal, he has also argued that arresting indictees will """"destabilize"""" Yugoslavia and its new government. In fact, experience in the region demonstrates that the way to solidify the transition to a form of government that respects human rights is to apply the rule of law. Refusing to transfer indictees to The Hague will only exacerbate the existing atmosphere of impunity for the most violent and lawless elements in Serbia.  Human Rights Watch called on the European Union to maintain pressure on Belgrade for full cooperation with the tribunal by linking future support in international financial institutions to concrete steps. The organization also urged European governments to postpone setting a date for the donors' conference until Belgrade fully cooperates with the war crimes court in The Hague.","Europe/Central Asia, Serbia/Kosovo",""

As the international community gathers this week in Geneva for the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, Human Rights Watch urged the adoption of a resolution to establish an international commission of inquiry to investigate this mass grave, as well as other human rights crimes committed by Russian troops and Chechen rebel forces.  """"The discovery of over fifty bodies right outside a Russian military base should have prompted an immediate and exhaustive investigation by the Russian prosecutor's office,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"To date, that investigation has been a charade. The Russian government has focused its energy on denying any responsibility for the deaths, rather than on ensuring a meaningful investigation. As a result, a lot of important evidence has now been lost.""""  On February 21, 2001, relatives of three Chechen men who had """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian soldiers in December 2000 discovered a large number of bodies, including those of their loved ones, in a cottage village in the immediate vicinity of the main Russian military base at Khankala. After reporting this discovery to the authorities, procuracy investigators closed off the area for civilians and started to recover the-reportedly often mined-bodies. In subsequent weeks, Russian law enforcement officials said they found another forty-eight bodies from the village.  The bodies were taken to a Ministry of Emergency Situations base and the October district police precinct in Grozny, where relatives of missing people had an opportunity to search for their loved ones. By March 13, 2001, fourteen of the forty-eight bodies had been identified and were taken away by relatives for burial. The remaining thirty-four bodies were buried in a village outside Grozny on March 10, 2001.  Immediately after news of the grave was first reported, Russian government officials denied responsibility for the bodies. They claimed the bodies were either those of Chechen rebel fighters who had been killed in battle or belonged to civilians who had been killed by Chechen rebel fighters and dumped in the village. On March 2, the Russian prosecutor overseeing the investigations in Chechnya went so far as to make the absurd suggestion that the fact that many of the dead people had worn Turkish underwear-worn by millions of people around Russia-was evidence that the dead had been rebel fighters. He also said that most of the dead men were wearing camouflage uniforms, which is not confirmed by photo and video footage of the bodies. The government failed to mention that the area in which the grave was found had been under Russian control since December 1999, long before the vast majority of the bodies were deposited there.  The government has failed utterly to conduct a credible investigation. No comprehensive forensic examinations were conducted before the bodies were reburied. As a result, important evidence has been lost. Human Rights Watch has obtained undisputable evidence that in many cases even a full description of the condition of the bodies was not made. Human Rights Watch reviewed photographs of bodies taken from the grave site that reveal that, at the time of their burial on March 10, 2001, the corpses had not been undressed nor had their arms been untied from behind their backs. Thus it is highly unlikely that forensic examiners and investigators could have examined the bodies thoroughly. During visits to the Ministry of Emergency Situations base in Grozny, researchers for Memorial Human Rights Center also learned that only a single forensic expert-who had no other equipment than rubber gloves and a scalpel-was conducting these examinations and that there was no equipment to cool the bodies for a longer period of time at the base.  Human Rights Watch also criticized the international community for failing to react appropriately to the discovery of the grave. """"Instead of forcefully demanding a full investigation of the mass grave and offering to provide technical and expert assistance in doing so, the international community silently stood by while the Russian government botched the investigation,"""" Cartner said. """"This negligence is yet another example of the international community's utter failure to hold Russia to its international obligations during this conflict.""""  European governments and the U.S., along with most international organizations, failed even to respond publicly to the news of the grave, thus signaling to Russian officials that there would be no consequences for failing to conduct a proper investigation. The Council of Europe human rights commissioner did raise the need for a full investigation with the Russian authorities during a February 2001 trip to Russia and Chechnya, but inexplicably failed to visit the mass grave or view the sixteen bodies that had been recovered at the time. As far as Human Rights Watch is aware, no international organization or individual government offered the Russian government technical assistance or expert staff to investigate the grave.  Meanwhile, human rights organizations have been able to establish that almost all of the bodies identified were of people who had previously """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian troops. On March 13, 2001, Chechen procurator V. Chernov stated that a total of seventeen bodies (including those of the first three who were recovered before the procuracy stepped in) had been identified.  As of this writing, Human Rights Watch has confirmed that twelve of the seventeen identified victims had previously """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian troops. Memorial has received information identifying another four victims. All of the victims apparently had execution-style bullet wounds and at least some of the bodies bore clear signs of torture, including stab wounds, broken bones, scalped body parts, and cut off ears. These human rights organizations have also collected photo and video materials that leave no doubt that the majority of the remaining thirty-four people whose bodies were found at the Dachny village had been summarily executed, and that many had been tortured. Many had had their hands tied behind their backs and had been blindfolded, and also showed signs of multiple bullet and stab wounds.","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

Yugoslav authorities have said they intend to prosecute Mr. Milosevic on corruption charges. But the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, established in The Hague under the authority of the United Nations, has indicted him for the slaughter of thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in early 1999, a crime against humanity.   """"Prosecuting Milosevic on corruption charges can never provide justice for the hundreds of thousands of victims of wartime atrocities in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"Milosevic should now be sent straight to The Hague to face trial for his worst crimes.""""   Last October Congress set out clear conditions for the U.S. government to continue some $100 million in economic aid to Yugoslavia. The law requires Yugoslavia to arrest and transfer those indicted by the war crimes tribunal to its custody. Other prominent indictees believed to be at large in Serbia include four senior Yugoslav and Serb officials indicted for crimes against humanity in Kosovo in early 1999, as well as three Yugoslav Army officials indicted for the slaughter of at least 200 Croats in Vukovar in 1991.   Cartner urged the Bush Administration to delay certification until Belgrade has made a public commitment to transfer without delay Milosevic and the other indictees to the custody of The Hague tribunal.   Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has continually opposed the tribunal. He has resisted cooperating with it by claiming that transferring indictees to The Hague would """"destabilize"""" the transition to democracy in Yugoslavia.   """"President Kostunica says he wants to restore the rule of law to Yugoslavia, and we heartily support that goal,"""" said Cartner. """"But cooperating with the tribunal is a key part of reintroducing a credible legal system.

Human Rights Watch's own research in Bosnia and Croatia has shown that the transfer of indictees to The Hague can facilitate democracy and stability.

The authorities in Belgrade have refused to arrest any of these war crimes suspects and surrender them to the custody of the ICTY in the Hague. The new Kostunica government has not even been willing to make a public commitment to do so in the foreseeable future.   The obligation to arrest and surrender individuals indicted by the ICTY stems not only from a series of binding legal documents--including pertinent resolutions by the United Nations Security Council--but also because of basic principles of justice. The heinous nature of the crimes at issue is often neglected in the ongoing debate, in the FRY and abroad, over cooperation between the ICTY and FRY. These crimes include widespread or systematic killings, torture, rape, and mass deportation of civilians in Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, and Kosovo.   This backgrounder offers a brief review of the most serious crimes believed to have been committed by the ICTY indictees who are currently enjoying protection in FRY. The backgrounder draws primarily upon the extensive research conducted by Human Rights Watch throughout the 1990s in the territory of the former Yugoslavia.   Vukovar - November 1991   Soldiers belonging to the federal Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija - JNA) and Serb paramilitary troops executed approximately 260 captive non-Serb men on November 20, 1991, near the Croatian town of Vukovar.[1] The JNA and paramilitaries had captured the town two days earlier, after a three-month siege in which most of the buildings in the city were destroyed. By the end of the siege, hundreds of civilians and some soldiers posing as patients or hospital staff, had sought refuge in the Vukovar hospital. On the morning of November 20, JNA units removed approximately 400 men from the hospital, loaded around 300 onto buses and transported them to a nearby Ovcara farm, four kilometers southeast of Vukovar. The soldiers then divided the captives into groups of ten to twenty and transported each group to a nearby location. JNA and Serb paramilitary groups then executed at least two hundred persons at the site. During the exhumation of the mass grave in Ovcara, in September and October 1996, the bodies of 198 men and two women were found. More than fifty other men who were taken from Vukovar hospital to the Ovcara farm remain missing.   Maj. Veselin Sljivancanin, the operational commander for the JNA in the latter stages of the siege of Vukovar, has admitted that Serbian troops did evacuate a number of people from the hospital to a place called Ovcara, but also claimed that he turned them all over to prison authorities in Sremska Mitrovica, a Serbian town which houses a major prison facility. Human Rights Watch, however, gathered testimonies of eight survivors, confirming that the summary execution of 200 patients took place at Ovcara. The Serbian government's account also contradicts Major Sljivancanin. In response to a protest letter written by Human Rights Watch to Slobodan Milosevic, then president of Serbia, the Serbian government (in a letter dated March 18, 1992) claimed JNA took 380 patients from the hospital and released 173 of them--not all of them, as Sljivancanin claimed. The government failed to explain what happened to the patients who were not delivered to Croatian authorities.   Veselin Sljivancanin, Mile Mrksic, and Miroslav Radic were indicted by the ICTY on October 26, 1995, for:   * beatings [wilfully causing great suffering, cruel treatment, inhumane acts] and killings [murder and wilful killing].   * crimes against humanity [murder and inhumane acts], grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions [wilful killing and wilfully causing great suffering], and violations of the laws or customs of war [murder and cruel treatment].    Veselin Sljivancanin is believed to be teaching at the Military Academy in Belgrade. Mile Mrksic was the commander of the Guards Brigade that had primary responsibility for the attack on Vukovar. He retired from military service in 1995. Miroslav Radic commanded a special infantry unit, a component of the Guards Brigade. He retired soon after the battle of Vukovar.   Srebrenica - July 1995   Thousands of civilians were killed by Bosnian Serb forces during and immediately after the offensive in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, in July 1995.[2] According to the ICRC, up to 8,000 men remain """"disappeared,"""" and most are believed to have been killed or executed.   Srebrenica was one of only three municipalities in eastern Bosnia that remained under Bosnian Muslim control after the break up of Bosnia in the spring of 1992. On April 16, 1993, the United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 819, demanding that all parties to the conflict """"treat Srebrenica and its surroundings as a safe area which should be free from any armed attack or any other hostile act.""""[3] Thousands of Muslims who had been expelled when Bosnian Serb forces took over their home municipalities, flocked to Srebrenica. As a result, at its peak, the population of Srebrenica swelled to between 55,000 and 60,000. There was almost no running water and electricity; food was in short supply and public hygiene was rapidly deteriorating.   By Tuesday, July 12, the civilian population had retreated toward the U.N. base in the nearby village of Potocari. Approximately 3,000 to 4,000 civilians were crammed inside the U.N. base, and 24,000 others stayed in the surrounding buildings or outside the camp. Most of Srebrenica's able-bodied men between the ages of sixteen and sixty had gathered together in the evening and early morning of July 11 and 12, in a separate location in order to escape capture. They set off on a long trek through Bosnian Serb-controlled territory in an effort to reach Bosnian government-controlled areas, the closest of which was about fifty kilometers away. The majority of the persons in this group were civilians; men and boys interviewed by Human Rights Watch stated that of the 12,000 to 15,000 trekkers, an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 were armed.   Once the refugees had gathered in Potocari, the Bosnian Serbs began the mass transportation of civilians to Bosnian government-controlled territory. Although most of the men had already fled to escape capture, some (mostly of non-draft age) remained. They were randomly separated from the rest of the people over the course of the next three days. Ratko Mladic, the commander of the army of the Bosnian Serb administration, arrived in Potocari on July 12. After Serbian television had recorded him handing out candy to children and telling the refugees that they would be taken care of, the atrocities began.   According to a witness interviewed by Human Rights Watch: """"Not long after Mladic left, about 1:00 p.m. or 2:00 p.m., the [Serbs] took about thirty boys away, we don't know where, but we never saw them again."""" A Muslim woman, J.N., described how her son was killed: """"And then my son Esmir . . . I was holding him in my arms. ... We were hugging, but they took him away. They grabbed him and just slit his throat."""" Dutch peacekeeping troops evacuated from Srebrenica said on July 23 that Bosnian Serb soldiers executed at least ten Muslim defenders and abducted between 150 and 300 men between the ages of sixteen and sixty.   Many men of military age who had attempted to make the trek through Bosnian Serb-held territory were captured along the way. They formed a column, which stretched for approximately ten kilometers. The men had to walk in such a vulnerable formation because they had been warned of mined terrain. During the trek, the column was exposed to numerous attacks and ambushes by Bosnian Serb forces. The ICTY prosecutor assessed that one-third of the column reached safety in Tuzla, while the rest--mostly unarmed civilians--remained trapped behind Bosnian Serb lines.   The column was divided into several smaller parts. The first group left the area in the early morning of July 12. The next day, near the village of Kamenica, Bosnian Serb soldiers ambushed the groups and, according to witnesses, killed up to 2,000 people. Many of the survivors became hysterical with terror and lost all emotional control, others decided to surrender or commit suicide. People who were located in the back of the column recounted how they found piles of corpses of people who had been in the front and middle of the columns, littered along the terrain.   Another group of approximately 6,000 to 7,000 men left on July 12, at around 11:00 a.m. After about three kilometers, they encountered the first Serb ambush at a stream. About 2,000 men from the middle of the column got caught in the line of fire, and many were killed.   Following ambush attacks, the survivors scattered and hid for days in the woods or in high grass. The Serbs urged them over loudspeakers to give themselves up. Serb soldiers executed on the spot some of those who surrendered, and detained others on the soccer fields in Nova Kasaba, Konjevic Polje, Kravica, and Vlasenica. Ratko Mladic spoke to captured Muslims in Nova Kasaba on July 12 or 13, and told them that they would not be harmed. On July 13, the Muslims who were captured in Nova Kasaba were taken to Bratunac, ten kilometers north of Srebrenica. They spent the night there, in the back of trucks, as Bosnian Serbian soldiers randomly pulled people out and summarily executed them. A survivor told Human Rights Watch: """"All night long we heard gunshots and moaning coming from the direction of the school. That was probably the worst experience, just sitting in the bus all night hearing the gunfire and the human cries and not knowing what will happen to you.""""   The following day, Bosnian Serb military personnel transported Muslim detainees from Bratunac and other locations to Karakaj, near Zvornik (about fifty kilometers north of the Srebrenica/Bratunac area), where they detained them in a school complex. Survivors told Human Rights Watch that they saw Ratko Mladic at the school on July 14. The men and boys were loaded onto trucks and driven to different outdoor locations, ordered to get out of the trucks in groups of five or ten, and lined up in front of Bosnian Serb soldiers who fired on them. As one survivor told Human Rights Watch in August 1995:   My cousin Haris ... took my hand. He said, """"They're going to execute us."""" As soon as he said that, I heard gunfire from the right side. Haris was hit and fell towards me, and I fell with him. I heard moaning from people who were just about to die, and suddenly Haris's body went limp. Someone was ordering [the Serbs] to finish us off individually. This process continued all day. I was frightened during the next """"tour"""" of prisoners, which was to be shot after us. They were executed about twenty meters away from me. I heard all the bullets whizzing by and thought I would be hit. During that day I also heard trucks continuously driving up to another area about one hundred meters away and gunshots, which would follow shortly thereafter. I also heard a bulldozer working in the background and became horrified. My worst nightmare was that I would be buried alive. I kept hearing people gasping, asking for water so they wouldn't die thirsty. Others kept on repeating, """"Kill me. Just finish me off,"""" until they were. ... By dusk I started to feel sleepy. I woke up, ... It was night time and I saw light beams from a bulldozer's headlights. I still heard the same noises as before - trucks driving up, people getting out and gunshots. ... Later, I heard a truck pull up and someone saying, """"No more left; it's late. We won't finish tonight...."""" They said, """"They're all dead anyway,"""" and then left.   Ratko Mladic was indicted by the ICTY on November 14, 1995, for genocide [killing members of the group] and a crime against humanity [extermination, murder], and a violation of the laws or customs of war [murder]. As of this writing, he is believed to be in Serbia, although recent reports also indicate that he may have been allowed to flee Serbia to the Republika Srpska of Bosnia and Hercegovina.   Kosovo, March-June 1999   After 10 years of systematic discrimination and severe restrictions on the civil and political rights of the Kosovo Albanian population by the Serbian government under president Slobodan Milosevic, an armed Kosovar Albanian movement called the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) began to gain popular support during 1998. During 1998 and 1999, the army and police campaign actions against the KLA resulted in hundreds of thousands of displaced Albanians, the murder of some 2,000, looting and pillage of their personal and commercial property, a systematic campaign of destruction of property, and other humanitarian law violations and human rights abuses. After the collapse of the Kosovo peace negotiations in Rambouillet, France, which were held in January 1999, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launched a bombing campaign in March 1999 against the Yugoslav forces in Kosovo and other parts of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   During the NATO bombing of FRY--from March 24 to June 8, 1999--Yugoslav forces continued and intensified attacks on civilians in Kosovo and forcibly expelled more than 850,000 ethnic Albanians from the province. Within three weeks of the NATO bombing, 525,787 refugees from Kosovo had flooded the neighboring countries, according to UNHCR. All told, government forces expelled 862,979 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo, and several hundred thousand more were internally displaced, in addition to those displaced prior to March 1999.   In early 1999, a distinct military build-up in Kosovo was observed, as well as the arming of civilians. While the government campaign seems to have been an attempt to crush the KLA, it clearly developed into something more once the NATO bombing began. With a major offensive underway, then-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic took advantage of the NATO bombing to crush the rebels and their base of support among the population, as well as forcibly to expel a large portion of the ethnic Albanian population.   Areas with historic ties to the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) were hardest hit. The municipalities of Glogovac (Gllogovc) and Srbica (Skenderaj) in the Drenica region, the cradle of the KLA, were the scene of multiple massacres of civilians, as well as arbitrary detentions, the use of human shields, forced labor, and the destruction of civilian property.[4] Mass killings, forced expulsions, and the destruction of civilian property were also common in the southwestern municipalities of Djakovica (Gjakove), Orahovac (Rrahovec), and Suva Reka (Suhareke), where many villages had long supported the insurgency. Massacres and other abuses also occured in villages in which KLA was not active, such as the villages of Slovinje (Sllovi), Ribare (Ribar), Ljubenic (Ljubeniq), Cuska (Qyshk),[5] and Pec town.   Refugees expelled toward Albania were frequently stripped of their identity documents and forced to remove the license plates from their cars and tractors before being permitted to cross the border. Before reaching the border, many Albanians had their personal documents destroyed, suggesting the government was trying to block their return.   Killings, or extrajudicial executions, were a key part of the """"ethnic cleansing"""" campaign. Throughout the province, civilians who were clearly noncombatants, including women and some children, were executed by Serbian police, Yugoslav army soldiers, or paramilitaries. In its research, Human Rights Watch documented 3,453 killings. But that number is definitely lower than the total, since it is based on only 577 interviews (and these interviews were not randomly sampled to allow for extrapolation of the data to all of Kosovo).   As of December 2000, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) had exhumed approximately 4,000 bodies in Kosovo. The number of exhumed victims is certainly less than the total number of those killed. Most importantly, there is incontrovertible evidence of grave tampering and body removal by Serbian and Yugoslav troops. Human Rights Watch documented attempts to hide or dispose of bodies in Trnje (Terrnje), Djakovica, Izbica (Izbice), Velika Krusa and Mala Krusa (Krushe e Madhe and Krushe e Vogel), Suva Reka, Slovinje, Poklek, Kotlina (Kotline), and Pusto Selo (Pastasel). Approximately 3,500 persons remain missing from the conflict, according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.   Rape and sexual violence were also components of the campaign.[6] Rapes of ethnic Albanians were not rare and isolated acts committed by individual Serbian or Yugoslav forces, but rather were used as instruments to terrorize the civilian population, extort money from families, and push people to flee their homes. In total, Human Rights Watch found credible accounts of ninety-six cases of sexual assault by Yugoslav soldiers, Serbian police, or paramilitaries during the period of NATO bombing, and the actual number is certainly much higher.   The destruction of civilian property by government troops in 1999 was widespread. According to a November 1999 UNHCR survey, almost 40 percent of all residential houses in Kosovo were heavily damaged or completely destroyed. Municipalities with strong ties to the KLA were disproportionately affected, in part because attacks against them began in 1998. But other areas without a history of KLA activity were also affected, such as the city of Pec, where more than 80 percent of the city's houses were heavily damaged or destroyed.   It appears that the Yugoslav Army (Vojska Jugslavije, or VJ) had overall command during the war, with the police and paramilitaries subservient to its orders, although top officials in the Ministry of the Interior clearly exercised significant influence over the campaign. The army controlled the main roads and the borders, coordinating and facilitating the """"ethnic cleansing."""" The police and paramilitaries were more involved in the direct cleansing and destruction of villages, with artillery support from the army. It is during these operations that men sometimes were separated from women and children, interrogated about the KLA, and executed.   According to Yugoslav law, the VJ is under the command of the Yugoslav President in both wartime and peace. Until October 2000, this was Slobodan Milosevic. The chief of the army's General Staff during the war was General Dragoljub Ojdanic, who was appointed after the war to Yugoslav Minister of Defense--the position he held until October 2000. The Serbian Ministry of Interior forces (Ministarstvo Unutrasnjih Poslova, or MUP) was run during the war by Minister Vlajko Stojiljkovic. Ultimate authority for the MUP also rested with Slobodan Milosevic, although he was not at the top of the MUP's de jure chain of command. Two other officials indicted by the ICTY in connection with crimes committed in Kosovo are: Nikola Sainovic, former Deputy Prime Minister of the FR Yugoslavia, designated as Slobodan Milsoevic's representative for the Kosovo situation; and, Milan Milutinovic, who at the time of the Kosovo war was President of Serbia and a member of the Supreme Defense Council; Milutinovic still holds these positions.   Slobodan Milosevic, Dragoljub Ojdanic, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, Milan Milutinovic, and Nikola Sainovic were all indicted by the ICTY on May 22, 1999, for violations of the laws or customs of war and for crimes against humanity committed by Yugoslav and Serbian troops under their command in Kosovo in early 1999: murder of hundreds of Kosovo Albanian civilians, forcible deportation of hundreds of thousands, and persecution based on racial, religious, and political identification.        [1] See Human Rights Watch, """"Prosecute Now!""""

The pattern of “disappearance,” torture, and extrajudicial and summary execution of detainees, and the use of unofficial and secret detention sites has been exhaustively documented by Russian and international human rights organizations. The mutilated corpses of some of the “disappeared” and of many other, unidentified individuals have been discovered in more than a dozen dumping grounds throughout Chechnya. The pattern of “disappearance,” torture, and extrajudicial and summary execution of detainees, and the use of unofficial and secret detention sites has been exhaustively documented by Russian and international human rights organizations. The mutilated corpses of some of the “disappeared” and of many other, unidentified individuals have been discovered in more than a dozen dumping grounds throughout Chechnya. Federal authorities in Russia are not committed to a meaningful accountability process. Criminal investigations into abuses by military and police forces in Chechnya have been shoddy, ineffective, and incomplete. The recent trial of a Russian colonel for the murder of a Chechen woman is the exception that shows that diligent investigations are possible, but that the political will to follow up on all serious violations has been lacking.  The federal government has not committed the necessary resources to investigations, nor are they empowering the relevant agencies to conduct them. Nowhere is the failure to investigate more obvious than in the mass “grave” at Dachny village, where at least fifty-one bodies were found beginning in January 2001. No autopsies were performed on the corpses, and the authorities have rushed to bury, rather than preserve for the purpose of further investigation, those corpses that have not yet been identified. Chechen forces violate humanitarian law by failing to protect civilian immunity during attacks on Russian positions, by attacking civilians who work in the local administration in Chechnya, and by ill-treating and summarily executing captured Russian soldiers.  Last year the 56th U.N. Commission on Human Rights adopted a resolution on Chechnya that called on both parties to the conflict to end the abuses. It called on the Russian government to, among other things, form a national commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and to invite the relevant U.N. special mechanisms to conduct visits to the region. The resolution represented the broadest consensus among international actors that impunity would not be countenanced in Chechnya. At the time, Commission members determined that the Russian criminal justice system should be given a chance to hold accountable those responsible for the abuses, and thus the resolution called for a national rather than an international commission of inquiry. The Russian government refused to comply with the resolution and willfully failed to implement most of its requirements. One year later, there are no effective domestic rosecutions, no national commission of inquiry has been established, and none of the national bodies set up has the capacity or the attributes required to take sufficient, effective and adequate steps toward bringing perpetrators of human rights violations to justice. It is this ongoing environment of impunity that facilitates continued, serious abuses.  Taking this into account, the Commission must now adopt a resolution that acknowledges the failure by Russian authorities to implement the resolution, renews calls for invitations to the special mechanisms, and calls for the creation of an international commission of inquiry to investigate violations of international human rights and humanitarian law. A strong resolution is needed to send a message to the federal authorities in Moscow that the Commission is committed without reservation to preventing abuses and ending impunity for them; that the lack of cooperation experienced by the U.N. Commission and other international organizations is unacceptable; and that responding to violations of international human rights and humanitarian law in any member country is the legitimate province of the Commission. Should the Russian authorities again fail to cooperate with a resolution, then an international commission of inquiry should stand ready to commit significant time and resources to compiling an official record of the atrocities perpetrated throughout the armed conflict in Chechnya.  The victims of this conflict deserve nothing less.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/04/01/human-rights-watch-cluster-bomb-memorandum","Human Rights Watch Cluster Bomb Memorandum","Human Rights Watch Cluster Bomb Memorandum","To Delegates to April Prepcom for the 2001 Review Conference for the Convention on Conventional Weapons","04/01/2001","In December 1999, Human Rights Watch first called for a global moratorium on the use of cluster bombs until humanitarian concerns can be adequately addressed.   When the submunitions contained inside cluster bombs fail to explode as intended, they become in effect antipersonnel landmines. Because of the high """"dud,"""" or failure, rate of the submunitions, and because of the large number typically dispersed over large areas, they have proven to be a serious and long-lasting threat to civilians, soldiers, peacekeepers, and even clearance experts.   It is clear that at the present time, the use of even the most sophisticated cluster bombs poses grave and unacceptable dangers to civilian populations. There should be no further use until governments can establish either that a technical solution is possible or that new restrictions and requirements regarding use can be effective.   Human Rights Watch asks that governments address this urgent humanitarian issue both domestically and at the international level. In December 1999 we recommended that the Convention on Conventional Weapons should be utilized as a means of establishing rules, restrictions, requirements, and/or prohibitions with respect to cluster bombs and their use that would minimize the dangers to and impact on civilian populations. In this regard, Human Rights Watch takes note of the proposal put forth by the International Committee of the Red Cross for a fifth Protocol dealing with explosive remnants of war.   Human Rights Watch holds that there should be no use of cluster bombs by any nation until:  A definitive study is made of various ways of minimizing the impact of cluster bombs on civilian populations. This should include an examination of technical possibilities and options related to use and targeting.  There is adequate research and analysis of past use of cluster bombs, including military usefulness, civilian impact, safety and overall effects.  There is a serious legal review of cluster bombs and their consistency with international humanitarian law. This should include an assessment of whether they are inherently indiscriminate, prone to indiscriminate use, excessively injurious, cause unnecessary suffering, have a disproportionate impact on civilians compared to their military utility, or violate the dictates of public conscience.   Human Rights Watch believes that a successful approach to ameliorating the negative humanitarian impact of clusters must include the following:  A prohibition on use in populated or urban areas.  A requirement for accurate recording and mapping of cluster bomb use.  Post-use requirements such as marking, warnings to civilians, clearance, and sharing of relevant information with appropriate clearance and awareness organizations.   HRW believes cluster bombs should not be used until it can be demonstrated that the failure rate of cluster bombs can be reduced to a tolerable level from a humanitarian perspective. That level should be determined by humanitarian and military experts, but should certainly be less than 1%.   On January 10, 2001, then-U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen issued a memorandum stating, """"It is the policy of the DoD [Department of Defense] to reduce overall UXO [unexploded ordnance] through a process of improvement in submunition system reliability - the desire is to field future submunitions with a 99% or higher functioning rate.... The Services shall design and procure all future submunition weapons in compliance with the above policy.""""2   On the technical side, there needs to be:  A realistic assessment of the failure rate of existing cluster bombs, which is often estimated anywhere from 2%-30%. There should also be an assessment if cluster bombs have a higher failure rate than other weapons that become unexploded ordnance, and if unexploded cluster bomblets are more volatile or dangerous than other UXO.  An examination of options to improve the reliability and safety of cluster bombs, and of the factors that affect cluster bomb reliability and safety (including fuses and secondary fuses, number of bomblets, area coverage, dispersal pattern, method and circumstances of delivery, special features like incendiary rings, characteristics of the target area, age and design).  An assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of putting self-destruct, self-neutralizing and/or self-deactivating mechanisms on all cluster bombs, both new production and existing stocks.   On the use side, there needs to be:  an identification of what constitutes a proper and effective use of cluster bombs.  an assessment of the feasibility and effectiveness of various other potential restrictions on use aimed at avoiding collateral damage, including target limitations and high-altitude delivery.    Use of Cluster Bombs   The following nations are thought to have used cluster bombs: Eritrea, Ethiopia, France, Iraq, Israel, Netherlands, Russia, Sudan, United Kingdom, United States, FR Yugoslavia.   Among the countries affected by cluster bomb use are: Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cambodia, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Iraq, Kuwait, Laos, Lebanon, Russia (including Chechnya), Sierra Leone, Sudan, Vietnam, Yugoslavia (including Kosovo), as well as the Falkland/Malvinas Islands.   The United States has continued to use cluster bombs in Iraq. While great press attention was paid to new President George W. Bush's decision to bomb Iraqi targets on February 16, there was scant recognition that some U.S. jets used cluster bombs, those formally known as the Joint Stand-Off Weapon (JSOW). JSOW was first used in combat in Iraq more than two years ago, on January 25, 1999. The 1,000 pound, fourteen-foot-long weapon carries 145 anti-armor and antipersonnel incendiary bomblets that disperse over an area that is approximately 100 feet long and 200 feet wide.   More than 1,600 Kuwaiti and Iraqi civilians have been killed, and another 2,500 injured, by the estimated 1.2 million cluster bomb duds left following the 1991 Persian Gulf War, which saw the most extensive use of cluster bombs in history. Indeed, in February 2001 alone, there was at least one Iraqi death and nine injuries from unexploded cluster bomblets, presumably all left over from the 1991 war.   During Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia and Kosovo, the U.S. dropped about 1,100 CBU-87 cluster bombs (each containing 202 submunitions), the U.K. dropped about 500 RBL-755 cluster bombs (each containing 147 submunitions), and the Netherlands dropped 165 CBU-87 cluster bombs. The fact that the Dutch used cluster bombs is little known. A total of 610 cluster bomb strike areas have been identified across Kosovo. Using a very conservative estimate of 5% failure rate, NATO forces left behind some 15,000 duds, waiting, like antipersonnel mines, to take lives and limbs during peacetime.   Since the conflict in Kosovo ended in June 1999, more than 500 people have been killed or injured by cluster bomblets, mines, and other UXO. U.S., U.K., and Dutch cluster bomb duds have been as much a problem for civilians and clearance specialists as landmines laid by Yugoslav forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. The U.N. Mine Action Coordination Center in Kosovo reported that as of December 15, 2000, a total of 4,932 cluster bomblets had been cleared, in addition to 4,586 antipersonnel mines, 4,315 antitank mines, and 5,853 unspecified UXO. In its June-September 2000 quarterly report, the Center wrote, """"During the previous quarter, it had been recognized that CBU [Cluster Bomb Units] were a major contributing factor to incidents involving civilians. In particular, CBU incidents generally involved groups of younger people, often with very tragic results.""""   In addition to the post-conflict casualties, Human Rights Watch believes there were nine to fourteen cluster bomb attacks resulting in civilian casualties during the conflict, causing an estimated 90-150 civilian deaths, or 15-26% of all civilian deaths, even though cluster bombs represented just 6% of weapons expended in the air war. A NATO air strike involving cluster bombs on an airfield in Nis on 7 May went off target, hitting a hospital complex and adjoining civilian areas. On 24 April, five boys were reported to have been killed and two injured when what was evidently a cluster bomb submunition exploded near the village of Daganovic.    Stockpiling of Cluster Bombs   The following forty-four nations are thought to have an arsenal of cluster bombs, either from domestic production or importation:   Africa- Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Nigeria, South Africa, Sudan   Americas- Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico, United States, Venezuela   Asia- China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan   Europe- Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, Yugoslavia   Middle East- Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates    Production of Cluster Bombs   The following nations are thought to be cluster bomb producers: Chile, China, France, Germany, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, Spain, South Africa, Turkey, United States, United Kingdom    Transfer of Cluster Bombs   The following nations are thought to have exported cluster bombs: Brazil, Chile, Germany, Israel, Italy, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, United States   1 For the purposes of this memorandum, HRW is using """"cluster bomb"""" as a short-hand, catch-all term for air- and surface-delivered dispensers containing unguided explosive submunitions.   2 Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Memorandum for the Secretaries of the Military Departments, Subject: DoD Policy on Submunition Reliability (U), January 10, 2001.

The international monitoring organization urged that Chinese authorities reveal the charges against Li Shaomin, a business professor at the City University of Hong Kong, who was detained on February 25, 2001 en route to Shenzhen in southern China. """"This appears to be another case of a foreign academic detained in China because his research or views are contrary to state policy,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"We're asking that the charges against Professor Li be made known, and that he be immediately and unconditionally released unless there is clear evidence that he has committed a non-political offense.""""  Li's family told Human Rights Watch he was doing research on China's economic development and """"e-commerce""""; he was also involved in a dot-com business in China. Li has written extensively on doing business in China and on the impact of privatization and market reforms on the performance of foreign enterprises.  Li Shaomin has been a U.S. citizen for the past six years; he studied at Princeton University and Harvard University. While his detention is likely to be related to his own activities, Chinese authorities may also be motivated by the fact that his father, Li Honglin, is a well known advocate of political reform and former political prisoner in China.  """"The chilling effect of Li's detention on international academic and business communities is all the greater, coming as it does on the heels of the detention of Gao Zhan,"""" said Jones.  Gao, a research scholar based at American University in Washington, DC, was detained in China last month and earlier this week was publicly accused by the Chinese Foreign Ministry of spying for foreign intelligence agencies. Her husband, Xue Donghua, who was also detained without charge and later released, has strongly denied the charges and the Chinese government has offered no evidence to back up its claims. The couple's five-year-old son, a U.S. citizen, was separated from them for twenty-six days, and the U.S. embassy was not notified of the detention. Human Rights Watch said China should immediately release Gao and let her rejoin her family in the U.S., absent any evidence of wrongdoing.  """"These two detentions, along with other widespread abuses of human rights, raise serious questions about China's willingness to respect basic international norms,"""" Jones noted. In October 1998, China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which specifically bars arbitrary detention. It has yet to ratify the treaty.

On March 23, the provincial court in Ratanakiri province ruled against a civil complaint brought by ethnic Jarai and Tampuen people in three villages.  Lawyers from Legal Aid of Cambodia (LAC), the non-governmental organization that represented the three villages, charged the villagers had been tricked into giving up 1,200 hectares of their land to Royal Cambodian Armed Forces Gen. Nuon Phea.  """"The verdict sets a bad precedent for indigenous land rights,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch, one of several international organizations that sent observers to the trial. """"It reinforces the idea that powerful individuals can use fraud and intimidation to take away people's land."""" LAC lawyer Ea Sopheap argued that district officials and intermediaries working for Gen. Nuon Phea pressured the villagers to thumbprint documents that - without their knowledge - provided legal land titles to the villagers. Those titles were then transferred to Nuon Phea.  District officials acting as middle men for the general admitted to receiving U.S. $35,000 from Nuon Phea's representative, money that the villagers testified they never saw. In addition, 70,000 riel (or approximately $18) was allocated as gifts to each village, to be split among village chiefs, deputy chiefs and chiefs of the local militia. The vast majority of the villagers, however, never received anything more than a """"gift"""" of two kilos of salt.  In the verdict, which took less than ten minutes to prepare after the day-long proceedings, Judge Nong Sok ruled that by thumbprinting sales and land title documents and accepting gifts, that the villagers had agreed to sell their land. The verdict was delivered only in Khmer, though indigenous interpreters were available during the proceedings.  The court ruling calls for the villagers - who eke out a subsistence livelihood by swidden farming - to pay taxes of approximately U.S. $615 plus court costs. At the same time, Gen. Nuon Phea is required to pay an additional 14 million riel ($3500) in compensation to the villagers.  A key issue raised by lawyer Ea Sopheap was the fraudulent nature of the sales agreement produced by local district officials, which transferred land titles that had been thumbprinted and issued in villagers' names to Nuon Phea.  Through the testimony of several Tampuen and Jarai children, LAC showed that titles were drawn up in the names of underage minors. A number of villagers testified that they thumbprinted the documents many times, in the names of other people. District officials admitted during the trial that land titles had even been issued in their own names, despite the fact that they have never been residents of any of the three villages. The villagers, meanwhile, had been told they were thumbprinting documents that would bring """"development"""" to their villages.  LAC called for the fraudulent sales agreement to be voided because the un-dated, photo-copied document did not specify the land's price, boundaries or area - or even the name of the buyer. In addition, the agreement had lists of names and thumbprints of villagers attached on separate sheets.  """"Fraud of this sort can only encourage other officials to abuse their power and swindle people out of their land,"""" said Jones.  More than fifty villagers attended the trial, as well as representatives from foreign embassies, the Cambodia Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and other local and international NGOs. Fourteen villagers were called as witnesses by LAC, testifying that they wanted their land back and never intended to sell it. LAC is now assisting the villagers in bringing the case to the Appeals Court in Phnom Penh.","Asia, Cambodia",""

The men, including a human rights lawyer and a religious leader involved in conflict resolution efforts in Aceh, were killed on Thursday afternoon, shortly after leaving a district police station. Human Rights Watch called on all governments concerned about the rapidly deteriorating situation in Aceh to demand a full investigation by a commission of inquiry. Such a commission should be set up under the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission and include qualified international experts, the international monitoring group said.  On Thursday afternoon, March 29, the bodies of three men were found in the village of Simpang Tiga Alue Pakuk in Sawang subdistrict, South Aceh. They had all been shot and the wounds were still fresh. Teungku Kamal, 42, was the head of a Muslim boarding school (pesantren) Darul Kamal in Blang Pidie, South Aceh; he was also a member of the team set up to monitor implementation of the """"peace through dialogue"""" agreement between rebels of the Free Aceh Movement (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM) in Aceh and the Indonesian government. Suprin Sulaiman, 37, was a lawyer with the Human Rights Coalition of Aceh. Amirduddin was a driver for the monitoring team.  The three men had left the South Aceh police station about a half hour earlier, according to witnesses. Teungku Kamal had been summoned for questioning as a suspect in a criminal defamation case in which members of the Mobil Police Brigade (Brimob) assigned to South Aceh said they had been falsely accused of raping and otherwise assaulting five young women from that district. Suprin Sulaiman was acting as Teungku Kamal's legal adviser. As of Thursday evening, it was unclear who precisely was responsible for the murders, but witnesses reported that a vehicle belonging to the security forces had entered the area just before they heard gunshots.  """"The military has made it clear for some time that they want the dialogue stopped and killing members of the monitoring team is one way to do it. Senior Brimob officials are clearly angry about the rape accusations. And both army and police have been implicated in previous attacks on human rights and humanitarian workers,"""" Jones noted. The true story behind the reported rapes that led to the defamation charges remains unclear. In February 2001, several human rights NGOs in Banda Aceh had accompanied five young women ranging in age from fifteen to nineteen to Banda Aceh, the provincial capital, where the accusations of rape by Brimob officers had been widely publicized. In the second week of March, the five were returning home for a Muslim holiday, accompanied by a local human rights monitor. The group spent the night at Teungku Kamal's school. The next day, they were taken into custody by the South Aceh police. The five women were questioned intensively, and then flown by helicopter to Banda Aceh where they were presented at a police press conference on March 9. At the press conference, they said they had been abducted by GAM rebels and forced to claim they had been assaulted. As of March 28, they remained under police """"protection"""" and no NGOs or lawyers had been given access to them. The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission and the National Commission on Women were negotiating with the Indonesian police for them to be turned over to the Women's Commission for protection and counseling. It is not clear which version of the women's account is true, but the recanting of their accusations against the police while in police custody raises troubling questions. The murders of Teungku Kamal, Suprin Sulaiman, and Amiruddin are the latest in a series of attacks on human rights and humanitarian workers in Aceh. The most publicized such murder was the August 2000 disappearance in Medan of Acehnese human rights lawyer Jafar Siddiq Hamzah who was found bound and stabbed to death several weeks later together with four other bodies that remain unidentified. Three Oxfam workers were arrested and tortured in August, and in December 2000, three workers for RATA, a nongovernmental organization for the rehabilitation of torture victims were abducted and executed in North Aceh. Four of the suspected killers escaped from detention last Thursday.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Foreign Minister Cem will meet Secretary of State Powell today. Cem and other high-level representatives of the Turkish government, including the newly appointed Minister of State for Economic Affairs, Kemal Dervis, are in Washington this week for talks on a range of multilateral and bilateral issues. A multilateral bail-out to address Turkey's financial crisis is expected to top the agenda, but Iraq, the frozen conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Turkey's relations with the European Union, and the pending $4 billion purchase of U.S.-manufactured attack helicopters are also likely to be discussed.  In a letter to Secretary Powell sent this week, the international monitoring group urged attention to Turkey's persistent human rights problems. Referring to a reform platform set out by then-Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz during a 1997 trip to Washington, Human Rights Watch pointed out that almost no progress had been made even on benchmarks Turkey had set itself. Yilmaz, now Deputy Prime Minister with responsibility for Turkey's relations with the European Union (E.U.), just last week rolled out another unconvincing reform agenda to a skeptical E.U. audience. The E.U. is properly insisting on human rights improvements as part of Turkey's bid for membership in that organization.  """"Whether it's E.U. membership, the purchase of U.S.-manufactured attack helicopters, or a financial bailout, Turkey's goals will not be achieved until concrete steps are taken to establish the rule of law and transparent and accountable structures of government,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia Division. """"Secretary Powell needs to press Turkey to tackle these issues in a meaningful way.""""  The IMF, which has repeatedly had to bail out Turkey's troubled economy, signed a policy framework agreement with Turkey last week, but has expressed reluctance to commit new funds to the country until financial sector reform takes place. Turkey is seeking nearly $12 billion in financing for 2001, after a recent public row between the president and prime minister over the handling of corruption charges sent the economy into a tailspin, with ripple effects throughout the developing world.  The financial crisis has called into question Turkey's ability to undertake the $4 billion purchase of 145 attack helicopters manufactured by U.S.-based Bell Helicopter Textron. Acquiring the helicopters is a top priority for Turkey's powerful military, but the sale has been opposed by rights groups fearful that the equipment will be used to commit human rights abuses.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/28/deterioration-human-rights-situation-tunisia","The Deterioration of the Human Rights Situation in Tunisia","The Deterioration of the Human Rights Situation in Tunisia","Joint letter to the European Union","03/28/2001","Various human rights organizations are writing to EU Foreign Ministers, EU High Representative for CFSP and European Commissioner Chris Patten regarding the European Union's upcoming Association Council meeting with Tunisia which was scheduled to take place on 10 April.  EU Foreign Ministers EU High Representative for CFSP European Commissioner Chris Patten  Your Excellencies:  We are writing to you regarding the European Union's upcoming Association Council meeting with Tunisia which was scheduled to take place on 10 April. The Association Agreement, which was signed on 17 July 1995 by the European Community and its Member States on the one hand and by the Republic of Tunisia on the other hand, and which came into force on 1 March 1998, includes a legally binding human rights clause (art. 2). This clause stipulates that relations between the Parties, as well as all the provisions of the Agreement itself, shall be based on respect for human rights and democratic principles, which guide their domestic and international policies and constitute an essential element of the Agreement. Our organizations believe the EU Council of Ministers and the European Commission have an obligation to address in concrete terms the serious concerns about the human rights situation in Tunisia in the context of the Association Council and to put in place a mechanism to ensure the necessary monitoring of the situation, with a view to bringing about verifiable progress.  The deterioration of the human rights situation (see enclosed document) since the EU-Tunisian Agreement took effect poses an acute challenge to the EU policy toward Tunisia, and more generally toward the Mediterranean region. How the EU proceeds in this regard toward Tunisia, the first country where an Association Agreement came into effect, will have precedential impact on the EU's credibility and effectiveness in addressing human rights issues with its other Mediterranean partners.  As noted by the European Commission itself in its recent communication on strengthening the Barcelona process of 6 September 2000, human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law should be discussed regularly with partners, notably within the Association Council. The Commission noted: """"This could lead to the establishment of joint working groups on human rights"""" … that """"would aim to agree on a number of concrete benchmarks and objective criteria to be reviewed within the various Association Councils...Cooperation on human rights, good governance and the rule of law should have as one of its main objectives the creation of a climate where NGOs can work productively.""""  In its resolution of 14 December 2000 the European Parliament expressed concern """"about the human rights situation and called on the Council and the Commission, """"to use all the means provided for by the Association Agreement between the European Union and Tunisia to secure respect for democratic freedoms and human rights"""" and for the next meeting of the EU-Tunisia Association Council """"to examine, in particular, the human rights situation in Tunisia and the restrictions placed on the activities of independent associations, in the context of the Meda-Democracy programme.""""  In a previous resolution passed on 15 June 2000 the European Parliament stressed that """"the promotion of human rights, democracy, civil liberties, the rule of law and sound management of public affairs constitutes an essential element of the EU-Tunisia Association Agreement with a view to creating a body of shared values."""" In this resolution the European Parliament expressed concern """"at the human rights situation in Tunisia, and called on the Association Council """"to carry out as soon as possible a joint evaluation of respect for human rights in Tunisia in order to involve both parties in addressing the issue, and asked the Commission to present to Parliament a report on the evolution of the human rights situation in Tunisia.""""  On 25 January 2001 France's National Consultative Human Rights Commission also urged the French Government to encourage its EU partners to take steps to ensure a follow up of the human rights situation in Tunisia in the framework of the Association Agreement (art.2), notably on the occasion of the next meeting of the Association Council.  In this context and in light of the increasingly grave attacks and restrictions on human rights defenders by the Tunisian authorities, the undersigned organizations (Amnesty International, Avocats sans frontières, the Euro-Med Human Rights Network, the International Federation for the Leagues of Human Rights, Human Rights Watch, the International Service for Human Rights, the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders, Reporters Without Borders, and the World Organization Against Torture) call on the EU to urge Tunisia to fulfil its obligations under the Association Agreement and international human rights law by, among other things: ·freeing all persons detained or imprisoned solely for the-nonviolent exercise of the right to speech, association, or assembly;  ·restoring the right to freedom of movement to all persons who are arbitrarily deprived of passports or forbidden to leave the country;  ·ending all forms of harassment against human rights defenders and their relatives by, among other measures, restoring their passports, telephone, and fax service where these have been deprived; by ending police surveillance that is manifestly conducted as a form of intimidation; and by allowing all independent human rights organizations including the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT) and the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH) to function legally and freely, in conformity with the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders; ·instituting effective safeguards to prevent the use of torture against persons in police custody;  ·instituting a credible and transparent system for investigating allegations of abuse and ensuring that human rights abusers are identified and brought to justice; and  ·inviting the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on human rights defenders to visit Tunisia.  Moreover, Tunisia should be urged not to obstruct European Commission efforts to provide grants to Tunisian non-governmental associations that seek such funding. The independence of the Commission in its decisions under Meda-Democracy should be fully recognised by the Mediterranean partners.  Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement provides the basis for programs to enhance human rights protection and promotion. We therefore strongly encourage the EU to ensure that its bilateral cooperation with Tunisia includes a strong component aimed at strengthening human rights and the rule of law.  In addition, Article 2 of the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement also involves concrete actions in the event of sustained and serious abuses. We therefore believe that full implementation of the Association Agreement with Tunisia requires the EU to raise concrete human rights concerns and press for verifiable progress on the basis of the recommendations specified above as well as the recommendations issued by the UN bodies.  We therefore call on the EU Council of Ministers and the European Commission to put in place concrete mechanisms to regularly assess compliance with Article 2 by all contracting parties to the Euro-Mediterranean Agreement. These should include:  ·regular and impartial monitoring of developments in the field of human rights and civil liberties in the territory of any of the contracting parties;  ·monitoring of the extent to which human rights defenders are free to act and speak out in defense of the rights of others;  ·issuing specific recommendations, compliance with which can be regularly measured, that are aimed at improving the human rights situation and that take into account the recommendations made by the UN human rights bodies about the country concerned;  ·making appropriate démarches towards partner countries in individual cases where violations of basic human rights standards have taken place;  ·making the assessment of compliance with Article 2 a separate agenda item in all meetings held under the Agreement, and especially the Association Council meetings; and  ·encouraging the Tunisian government to extend an invitation to the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on human rights defenders to visit Tunisia.  In light of the above we urge you to ensure that the Association Council, which was scheduled to take place on 10 April, is convened as soon as possible. The next meeting of the Association Council should not be another missed opportunity but should rather be the starting point of a process aiming at effectively addressing the human rights problems in Tunisia. To this end, it should set detailed benchmarks to be assessed at the next meetings to take place under the Agreement.  We thank you for your consideration of these matters.

Paradoxically, while the official human rights bureaucracy flourishes, members of the independent human rights community and their relatives have been increasingly targeted and repressed. Such practices aim to silence and punish those who stand up for human rights, and to deprive victims of human rights violations of any defence. In this respect the conduct of the Tunisian authorities violates the international human rights treaties to which Tunisia is a State Party, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UN Convention against Torture), as well as the Declaration on Human Rights Defenders adopted by consensus - and hence with Tunisia's approval - by the UN General Assembly on 9 December 1998.  The targeting of human rights defenders by the Tunisian authorities, an entrenched pattern for a number of years already, has increased in recent months. At the end of November 2000 a court suspended the activities of the new assertive leadership of the Ligue Tunisienne des Droits de l'Homme, LTDH - Tunisian Human Rights League), and took control of the LTDH office. The pretext for this attack on the LTDH was a complaint lodged by four LTDH members, known to be close to the authorities, who questioned the fairness of the LTDH's general assembly and elections of a new board the previous month. The move followed virulent attacks by the head of President Ben Ali's governing party and by the government-controlled press against the newly elected LTDH board, which included many well-known and outspoken human rights activists who had clearly indicated that the LTDH would take up the challenge of addressing the deteriorating human rights situation in the country. On 12 February 2001 the court annulled the results of the LTDH's general assembly of October 2000, including the election of a new leadership. Since the suspension of the LTDH's activities last November its leadership and members in the capital and in other cities have been repeatedly prevented from holding meetings in private homes and offices or in cafés, restaurant or other public places. Security agents have on each occasion cordoned off the meeting places, preventing participants from accessing not only the building where the meetings were scheduled to take place but even the streets where the buildings are located. In addition, the authorities have initiated legal proceedings against the LTDH President, Mokhtar Trifi, and its 1st vice-president, Slaheddine Jourchi, for having signed communiqués on behalf of the LTDH denouncing human rights violations. They have both been charged, in March and January 2001, respectively, with """"spreading false information"""" and """"non-compliance with a judicial decision"""". They are currently awaiting trial.  Dr. Moncef Marzouki, former President of the LTDH and spokesperson for the Conseil National des Libertés en Tunisie (CNLT - National Council for Liberties in Tunisia), was sentenced in December 2000 to one year's imprisonment on charges of """"spreading false information"""" and """"maintaining an unauthorized association"""", that is the CNLT (which has been refused legal status by the authorities). In July 2000 Dr Marzouki was arbitrarily dismissed from his public sector post as professor of medicine at Sousse University. These are only the latest attacks against Dr Marzouki, who has had a long history of being harassed. He had been imprisoned for four months in the summer of 1994 for an interview he had given to a Spanish newspaper about the human rights situation in Tunisia. Having just recovered his passport in May 2000, after six years of confiscation, Dr Marzouki was again prevented from leaving Tunisia in December 2000 and again in March 2001. Other leading members of the CNLT, including its former secretary general, Omar Mestiri, have also been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution, on similar charges and are subjected to constant intimidation, harassment and surveillance. Security agents have on several occasion beaten or ill-treated CNLT leading members and activists. Most recently on 1 March 2001, when a CNLT meeting to present its newly elected leadership was prevented by security forces who physically prevented participants from gaining access to the house where the meeting was due to take place and insulted and ill-treated some of them. Security agents beat and ill-treated Khadija Cherif, a leading member of the Association tunisienne des femmes démocrates, (ATFD - Tunisian Association of Democratic Women), Abdelkader Ben Khemis, member of the CNLT's liaison committee, Sihem Bensedrine, the newly elected CNLT spokesperson, and others. On 13 March 2001 Khadija Cherif was again attacked by security agents, who took by force some documents she was carrying. Similar attacks have been repeatedly perpetrated against CNLT members in the past two years. In April 2000 some leading CNLT members, as well as lawyers and human rights defenders, and foreign journalists were beaten by the police. Among those who were beaten were Sihem Ben Sedrine, and 70-year-old 'Ali Ben Salem, also a member of the CNLT. In December 2000 Sihem Ben Sedrine's car was broken into and a large knife and threatening message were left on the back seat of the car - which was parked outside her home, in full view of police agents who keep a close watch on the building 24 hours a day. In recent months police agents have systematically prevented all CNLT's meetings from taking place by cordoning off the houses where the meetings were to be held, and victims of human rights violations are routinely prevented from entering the building where the CNLT's office is situated. Another exemplary case of constant repression and harassment is that of human rights lawyer and leading CNLT member Nejib Hosni. Having been freed early four years ago from a prison sentence he should have never served, Hosni was once again imprisoned in December 2000. He was first arrested in 1994 and sentenced to eight years' imprisonment on trumped-up charges of forgery of a land contract. He was eventually released at the end of 1996 after widespread international protests. However, his sentence included an arbitrary five-year ban on practicing law, and upon his release he had his passport confiscated (it has still not been returned to him) and his telephone and fax lines, both at his home and office, were disconnected and have not been restaured since. In the spring of 2000 Nejib Hosni resumed practicing law, having received written confirmation from the Conseil de l'Ordre des Avocats, the Tunisian Bar Council, the only body which may decide to suspend or disbar a lawyer, that he had never been suspended or disbarred. Shortly after, the Minister of Justice issued instructions to the courts around the country not to allow Nejib Hosni to handle cases and not to give him access to his clients' files. In September 2000 the authorities initiated legal proceedings against him on charges of """"non-compliance with a judicial decision"""" for having defended victims of human rights violations before several courts around the country. He was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment on 18 December 2000. On 5 January, on the day he was due to be released after having served his 15-day sentence, the Minister of the Interior revoked the conditional release measure under which Nejib Hosni had been released in December1996, requiring him to serve the remaining five and-a-half years of the above-mentioned eight-year prison sentence imposed in 1996 on the trumped-up forgery charges.  Radhia Nasraoui, a member of the executive committee of the Tunisian Bar Council, has endured years of harassment and intimidation because of her human rights activities. In March 1998, after joining the defence team representing a group of young students and political activists accused of links with the unauthorized Parti Communiste des Ouvriers Tunisiens (PCOT), Tunisian Workers' Communist Party, Nasraoui was indicted as their co-conspirator and thereby disqualified from representing them. For a year and-a-half she was banned from leaving the capital, a measure which prevented her from visiting clients and being present in courts elsewhere in the country. In January 1999 she was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment, suspended, for having left the capital for one day to attend the funeral of her mother-in-law. In July 1999 she was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, suspended, in the above-mentioned PCOT trial. In addition, she and her children and several other relatives continue to be harassed and intimidated and her children were refused passports until July 2000. Nasraoui's office and home remain under tight police surveillance, her telephone lines are often disconnected, and she is often prevented from visiting her clients in prison, in violation of Tunisian law.  Leaders and members of other NGOs and associations, have been similarly targeted. In June 2000 Fathi Chamkhi, President of the Rassemblement pour une Alternative Internationale de Développement (RAID - Rally for an International Alternative for Development), and RAID member Mohamed Chourabi were sentenced to one month's imprisonment for having links with unauthorized associations. They had been arrested in April for possessing reports by the RAID and the CNLT, both of which organizations have been refused registration by the authorities.  In October 2000 leaders and members of the Association Tunisienne des Femmes Démocrates (ATDF - Tunisian Association of Democratic Women), were beaten by police as they gathered in the centre of the capital to demonstrate in solidarity with the Palestinian people. On 29 January 2001 a meeting organized by the ATDF in solidarity with the LTDH was prevented from taking place by security agents who stopped anyone from accessing the ATDF's office in Tunis.  The above are but a few examples of the tactics used by the authorities to prevent and discourage Tunisians from working to defend the rights of others. In addition to those mentioned above, numerous human rights lawyers and activists have been and continue to be subjected to measures of harassment and intimidation that inflict harm on their social, professional and family lives. Their clients, friends, and relatives are intimidated by plainclothes security agents who follow them or approach them to check their identity papers or question them. The cutoff of telephone lines and the confiscation of mail further disrupts family and professional life and heightens their vulnerability, especially in emergency situations.  Confiscation of passports also continues to be used by the authorities to prevent human rights defenders from participating in activities abroad. Even though in the spring and summer of 2000 several human rights defenders had their passport returned to them after years of confiscation, the passport of several others have not been returned or have since been confiscated. These include CNLT and RAID members Nejib Hosni, Sadri Khiari, Ali Ben Salem, Mohamed Chourabi, Jalel Zoghlami and Ali Ben Romdhane.  In keeping with the policy of curtailing the activities of human rights defenders inside and outside the country, the Tunisian authorities have also expelled or denied access to Tunisia to a number of representatives of international human rights organizations and foreign journalists. In July 2000 the President of the Fédération internationale des ligues des droits de l'homme (FIDH - International Federation of Human Rights), and an Amnesty International researcher, who have been banned from Tunisia since 1995 and 1994, respectively, were denied entry to Tunisia upon their arrival at Tunis airport. In January 2001, French lawyer Eric Plouvier mandated by the EuroMed Human Rights Network (EMHRN) and by the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders to observe the trial of the LTDH was turned away when he arrived at Tunis airport. In February 2001 RSF Secretary-General Robert Ménard, and RSF member Jean-François Julliard were expelled from Tunisia (see details below). Other human rights workers and journalists who have been banned from Tunisia or expelled from the country in earlier years have also not been allowed to return.  Restrictions on the media and on civil society  The situation that prompted the Paris-based World Association of Newspapers to expel its Tunisian affiliate in 1997 remains unchanged. Tunisia's television, radio, and daily press contain no criticism of state repression and ignore all information emanating from Tunisian and international non-governmental organizations which concern the situation of human rights and public liberties or which might imply criticism of the authorities' policies and actions. Tunisia's private newspapers are indistinguishable in tone from the official ones. Smaller periodicals which at times cautiously deviate from the official line have been seized when they published more challenging articles. One of these publications, al-Mawqif, has been banned in recent months for this reason. Two new publications, Kalima, edited by Sihem Ben Sedrine, and Kaws el Karama, edited by Jalel Zoghlami, have been denied authorization by the authorities.  In February 2001 Jalel Zoghlami was attacked and beaten by men believed to be security agents in broad daylight in the centre of the capital. Three days later he and several of his friends, including human rights defenders, were assaulted by security forces outside his house. They were beaten with iron bars and sticks and at least seven of them sustained serious injuries. The security forces remained present in large numbers outside the house throughout the night and the following day and prevented lawyers and others from entering Jalel Zoghlami's house, where 22 people, including those injured were present. In the spring of 2000 Jalel Zoghlami's brother, Taoufik Ben Brik, a journalist and correspondent of several foreign media, undertook a lengthy hunger strike to protest at the confiscation of his passport and the police harassment against himself and his family. Also in the spring of 2000 Sihem Ben Sedrine's publishing house, Aloès, was closed down by the authorities for three months after a public meeting was held there on press freedom in Tunisia.  On 21 February, while Robert Ménard, RSF Secretary-General, Virginie Locussol, North Africa desk officer within the organisation, and Hervé Deguine were distributing copies of the banned newspaper Kaws el-Karama in the capital, plainclothes police officers seized the copies from them. A fourth member of the organisation, Jean-François Julliard, who was filming the events, was assaulted by three police officers, who seized his video camera. Robert Ménard and Jean-François Julliard were then taken to the airport and expelled to France by police officers who declared them personae non gratae.  In May 2000, days after he published an article critical of President Ben Ali's policies in the French daily Le Monde, journalist and former editor of the Arabic version of Le Monde Diplomatique Riadh Ben Fadhel was shot and seriously wounded in the chest by unknown gunmen. The attack, which bore the hallmark of an attempted extra-judicial execution, took place outside Ben Fadel's home, which is situated near the presidential palace and the residences of members of the presidential family, an extremely well guarded area.  Well-established NGOs like the ATFD or the Association Tunisienne des Jeunes Avocats (ATJA), Association of Young Lawyers, and their members continue to face impediments related to their efforts to take independent positions on current issues. Their activities are hindered at the regional and international level by intimidating police surveillance and by the fact that many of their active members have been deprived of passports at one time or another. The Tunisian government has also raised objections to and blocked a grant which the European Commission had approved for the LTDH.  Attempts to create new civil rights associations have been stifled by the government's refusal to grant such groups the necessary authorization. For example, the CNLT, which was created on 10 December 1998, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and RAID, have been refused authorization by the Ministry of Interior and their members continuously harassed for maintaining an unauthorized association (see above).  Trade unionists who have voiced concern at the increasing control by the authorities of the Tunisian General Trade Union (Union Générale Tunisienne du Travail, UGTT) have also been targeted. In May 1999 at least ten trade unionists who had signed petitions and made declarations condemning government interference in the UGTT's affairs were arrested and detained for up to a few days.  Surveillance and blocking of communications via mail, telephone, fax and the Internet make it difficult for Tunisian NGOs and activists to communicate regularly and freely with each other at home and abroad. A postal law decreed June 2, 1998 provides that """"postal materials that...could harm public order or security are not acceptable. If [such] mail is found...it will be confiscated in conformity with the laws in effect."""" The World Wide Web sites of international human rights organizations, media, and UN human rights bodies are inaccessible much of the time and other sites are blocked on particular occasions. The websites of certain French newspapers, television and radio stations are routinely blocked on days when they carry items critical of the Tunisian authorities.  Repression of all dissenting voices  The period of reform initiated by President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali after he took power in November 1987, was extremely brief; the human rights situation began to deteriorate in the last quarter of 1990. By the mid-1990s the repression, which targeted Islamists first and foremost, was broadened to cover left-wing activists and all other opposition political tendencies, including those who had hitherto supported the authorities' crackdown on the Islamist opposition, as well as student leaders, trade unionists, professional associations, the media, and others.  Today, known or suspected government opponents and critics across the political spectrum risk detention simply for the peaceful exercise of the rights to freedom of opinion, expression, and association. Thousands of known or suspected political opponents have been tortured and imprisoned after unfair trials over the past decade. Even though more than 500 prisoners of conscience were released in November 1999, some 1,000 remain in prison and are detained under conditions that amount to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Their relatives are targeted for harassment, intimidation, deprivation of passports, and detention.  Former prisoners of conscience are routinely prevented from working and resuming a normal life and are required to report to the police on a regular basis, ranging from several times a day to several times a week. This practice, known as contrôle administratif, administrative control, is sometimes imposed arbitrarily and at other times by the courts as part of the sentence; in the latter case administrative control is imposed for a period of five years from the date of release but former prisoners continue to be forced to report to police long after the expiry of the five-year period. One example of this practice is the case of Ali Sghaier, a father of seven, who years after having served a three-year prison sentence for his political opinions, continued to have to report daily to the police and was prevented from working and was thus unable to provide for his family. In June 2000, out of despair at his situation he took his youngest children to the weekly market in Douz (south of the country) and held a sign on which he had written """"I am prevented from working and cannot feed my children, would anyone like to buy them?"""". He was arrested and in September 2000 sentenced to six months' imprisonment.  Relatives of political prisoners continue to be subjected to harassment and restrictions and those who provide financial support, however modest, to relatives of political prisoners and of exiled opponents are themselves prosecuted on charges of supporting """"unauthorized associations."""" The arbitrary deprivation of passports has been one of the abuses most commonly used not only against human rights activists and known or suspected political opponents, but also against their relatives. This policy has caused great suffering among the families of political refugees living in European countries. Wives of exiled political opponents have often been prevented from leaving the country with their children to reunite their families; those who in desperation attempted to leave the country without a passport have been imprisoned for lengthy periods of time. Although many of these cases have been resolved in recent years thanks to international pressure, including démarches made by EU member governments, many families remain divided because of this vindictive policy.  Ordinary Tunisians who work or study abroad are often arrested when they return home to visit their families, and are imprisoned on charges of having had contacts with political opponents abroad, even though in some cases the contacts they had with exiled opponents were of a purely social nature and they were not even aware of their political activities. Tunisian law was amended in 1993 (Article 305 of the Code de Procédure Pénale, Penal Procedure Code) to include a provision which allows for any Tunisian to be prosecuted in Tunisia for activities abroad even though these activities do not constitute an offence according to the laws of the country where they took place. In recent months at least five people have been arrested upon their return to Tunisia on such charges and have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  Unfair trials: A judiciary lacking independence  When it comes to trials involving political charges, Tunisian courts systematically fail to guarantee the most basic rights of defendants to a fair trial. Defendants are systematically refused medical examinations despite having exercised their right under Tunisian law to request such examinations and even in cases where marks of torture are still visible - months after they have been tortured. Defendants are also frequently prevented from calling witnesses who would testify in their favour. Judges routinely disregard defendants' statements that they were forced to sign """"confessions"""" under duress and without having read the content, and instead use these as the main evidence to convict.  Despite the purely political and non-violent nature of the offenses being prosecuted, notably having links with unauthorized Islamist or left-wing political opposition groups, defendants are routinely charged with """"belonging to a criminal gang"""", """"participating in a conspiracy to attack and harm people and properties"""" and such charges. This is in attempt by the authorities to present individuals known or alleged to be involved in non-violent political opposition activities as dangerous criminals or """"terrorists"""". In recent months scores of political prisoners have undertaken lengthy hunger strikes to protest against their imprisonment, the conditions of their detention, the lack of investigation into their allegations of torture and in some cases their prolonged detention without trial. Detainees on hunger strike are often beaten or ill-treated, refused necessary medical care or even sugar water, and are regularly prevented from receiving visits by their families and lawyers, to punish them for going on hunger strike and force them to stop.  For example, in November 2000 Abdellatif Bouhajila, Yassine Benzerti and several other of young men accused of links with an Islamist group were brought to trial during their prolonged hunger strike - one of them had been on hunger strike for 89 days and others for over 70 days. They were brought into court on stretchers and were laid on benches, unable to sit up or speak and barely conscious. Their defence lawyers requested the postponement of the trial on account of the incapacity of the defendants to participate in their own trials, but the court refused and the defence lawyers walked out in protest. The defendants were tried and sentenced without any defence to up to 17 years' imprisonment. This trial was attended by numerous Tunisian lawyers and human rights activists and by a member of the European Parliament. Representatives of European embassies in Tunisia have also attended several trials of human rights defenders and of people tried on political charges.  Tunisia's record on women's rights  Since independence, women in Tunisia have made impressive strides in securing their rights. The Personal Status Code adopted under former President Habib Bourguiba gave women many legal rights they did not previously enjoy. The illiteracy rate for women has dropped and their presence in higher education and in the workforce has grown.  At the same time, women are no less restricted than men with respect to the exercise of their political and civil rights. When the Tunisian Association of Democratic Women (ATFD) tries to highlight areas where the treatment of women could improve - through communiqués, public awareness campaigns, meetings, and rallies - its efforts are stymied. Public gatherings are often barred by the authorities, members such as lawyer Najet Yacoubi are under constant surveillance, and the pro-government media ignore its activities, except to suggest the association is """"libertine"""" or """"lesbian"""" or to misrepresent it in other ways.  In addition, the authorities systematically harass the wives of suspected Islamists who are in jail or exile, through detention, surveillance, searches without warrants, incessant police questioning, and confiscation of passports. Several women have been put under pressure by police to divorce their jailed or exiled husbands. These abuses were raised in the report of the UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women (E/CN.4/1999/68/Add.1).  Another area where much progress must still be made with respect to women's rights is domestic violence. According to the ATFD, which runs the country's only shelter for women victims of violence, domestic violence is commonplace. Yet government officials have not acknowledged this and, according to women's rights activists, a climate of impunity prevails because police officers fail to investigate incidents adequately and judges tend to dismiss domestic violence as a family matter. Again, restrictions on political rights are part of the problem: the ATFD has long been calling on the government to secure the right of independent organizations to work freely to combat violence against women.  International awareness of the human rights situation in Tunisia :  The European Union EU member states are well aware of human rights violations and restrictions of civil liberties and freedoms of expression and association in Tunisia. The European Parliament passed two resolutions, in June and December 2000 (mentioned above), expressing concerns at the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia and calling on the EU to take concrete measures to address the issue.  The Evaluation of the Meda Democracy Programme 1996-1998, prepared for the European Commission and issued in March 1999, cites Tunisia in Section 2.9 as one of the Euro-Mediterranean countries where serious problems exist in carrying out human rights and civil liberties promotion activities:  """"Syria and Tunisia received the lowest share [of funds] both in terms of grants per country and per capita. This reflects the severe political obstacles to directly assist NGOs in these countries without agreement by the government and the totalitarian nature of the political systems in Syria and Tunisia"""".  The United Nations The UN human rights mechanisms present a stark picture of the situation in Tunisia. In December 2000 the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative on human rights defenders expressed concern about the suspension of the activities of the Tunisian League for Human Rights and intimidation against its members and called on the Tunisian Government to end the harassment of human rights defenders in the country.  In February 2000 the UN Special Rapporteur on Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Opinion and Expression issued a report (E/CN.4/2000/63/Add.4) following his visit to Tunisia in December 1999 in which he detailed numerous concerns about the restrictions imposed by the authorities on such liberties and strongly urged the government to take concrete measures to address these concerns.  In November 1998 the UN Committee Against Torture examined the government of Tunisia's report (which was submitted four years late) and declared itself """"disturbed by the reported widespread practice of torture"""" and """"concerned over the pressure and intimidation used by officials to prevent the victims from lodging complaints."""" The committee charged that by denying these allegations, """"the authorities are in fact granting those responsible for torture immunity from punishment, thus encouraging the continuation of these abhorrent practices."""" The committee urged the government to ensure strict enforcement of the provisions of the law and procedures of arrest and police custody. (See the Concluding Observations of the Committee against Torture, CAT/C/TUN, November 19, 1998.) At the same time, the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, who in October 1998 requested to conduct a working visit to Tunisia, has received no invitation.  In its 1998 and 1999 sessions, the UN Sub-Commission on Human Rights expressed concern at the cases of human rights defenders Khemaïs Ksila (conditionally freed from prison in 1999) and Radhia Nasraoui (mentioned above). In May 1999 the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued its finding that the detention of Ksila was arbitrary.  The Tunisian government's fifth periodic report to the UN Human Rights Committee was due in February 1998 but has not been submitted. In October 1994, after examining Tunisia's fourth periodic report, the UN Human Rights Committee examined, expressed concern about the human rights situation and urged the government of Tunisia to implement a series of recommendations so as to bring Tunisia into compliance with its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. (See the Comments of the UN Human Rights Committee, adopted on 2 November 1994, CCPR/C/79/Add.43.) To date, none of the key recommendations have been implemented.","Middle East/North Africa, Tunisia",""

The fifty-page report, """"Uganda in Eastern DRC: Fueling Political and Ethnic Strife,"""" documents how Ugandan authorities meddled in rivalries among factions of the rebel Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD). Some of these quarrels degenerated into military skirmishes in which civilians have been killed and injured.  The report shows how Ugandan soldiers intervened in a long-standing dispute between Hema and Lendu peoples, in many cases lending firepower to Hema, sometimes in return for payment. During more than two years of Ugandan occupation, the Hema-Lendu war claimed more than 7,000 lives and displaced an estimated 200,000 people.  Uganda has pulled some of its troops out in recent weeks, but not from the areas most affected by the abuses described in the report.  """"Uganda sent its troops into Congo supposedly to assure its own security, but in the process, it has caused greater insecurity for its unfortunate neighbors,"""" said Alison Des Forges, Senior Advisor at the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Pulling out some of its troops does not relieve Uganda of the responsibility for investigating and punishing the soldiers who have been involved in these crimes.""""  Des Forges said that Congolese leaders, including the heads of political factions and organizers of militias, have also violated the rights of their fellow citizens in Ugandan-dominated zones. The Ugandans trained local combatants who were recruited by rival political leaders on the basis of personal or ethnic loyalty, and who were more likely to be used for local advantage than in the war against the Congo government. Both the Ugandans and leaders of the Congolese Rally for Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML) recruited and trained children as combatants. In August 2000 Uganda airlifted 163 children from Congo to Kampala for military training.  """"Uganda has repeatedly promised to end the use of child soldiers, yet here it is openly teaching Congolese children to make war,"""" said Des Forges. """"When does it plan to start making good on these promises?"""" Congolese political leaders in the Ugandan-controlled region have detained rivals, held them in inhumane conditions, and sometimes tortured them. Ugandan soldiers have similarly abused Congolese whom they have identified as opponents. Ugandan authorities in mid-2000 approved an alliance between RCD-ML leader Mbusa Nyamwisi and Mai-Mai, a local militia hostile to foreign occupiers, and even arranged to provide military training for them. Later, Ugandans rejected the arrangement and began fighting the Mai-Mai. In subsequent conflicts, Ugandan troops captured and summarily executed Mai-Mai combatants. They also attacked local people thought to have aided the Mai-Mai, killing civilians and laying waste their villages. Ugandan soldiers also backed the RCD-National, supposedly another rebel political movement but apparently really an operation to extract and market the rich mineral resources of the Bafwasende area.  """"Ugandan soldiers have blatantly exploited Congolese wealth for their own benefit, and that of their superiors at home,"""" said Des Forges. """"In competing for control of Congo's phenomenal resources, the Ugandans as well as other parties to this war have committed countless atrocities against the Congolese population."""" Uganda has been withdrawing some of its troops from the front lines in the Congo, as required by the Lusaka Accords of July 1999. Local groups in the Ugandan-controlled areas have also pledged new efforts to resolve their conflicts peacefully.  """"We welcome these promising signs of peace,"""" said Des Forges, """"but the people of this region are saying that the end of war is not enough. They ask for justice for the wrongs done them. Uganda must investigate the reported misconduct of its troops. The international community, generally silent about these abuses until now, must insist that Uganda does in fact require accountability from its soldiers in the Congo.""""","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",""

The Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1999 would prevent a person from challenging an administrative decision on the basis that the decision-maker failed to take into account rights granted by international treaties to which Australia is a party. The bill passed the House of Representatives on May 5, 2000, and is expected to have its second reading debate in the Senate on Thursday. The Bill would overturn the so-called Teoh decision, a 1995 ruling by the High Court that it was reasonable for a person to expect that the government would take into account its international treaty obligations in making administrative decisions, even if the provisions of the treaty had not been incorporated into Australian law. The treaty in question was the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  """"This bill is an overreaction by the government to the decision in the Teoh case and is a step backwards-not just for Australia but for human rights protection more generally,"""" said Sidney Jones, director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division.  The High Court said in the Teoh case that ratification of an international convention should not be dismissed as a """"merely platitudinous"""" act but as """"a positive statement by the executive government of this country to the world and to the Australian people that the executive government and its agencies will act in accordance with the Convention.""""  Other courts, including in the UK and New Zealand, have followed the Teoh decision. The superior courts of these countries, which share the same legal system as Australia, clearly believe that this procedural right is consistent with the recognized roles of the courts, the Parliament and the executive in implementing international law into domestic law. The right to challenge a decision on the basis that it was made without reference to the many human rights treaties Australia has ratified is important for at least two reasons. The first is that Australia has failed to fully incorporate its treaty obligations into Australian law, and the second is that Australia has no bill of rights. The Teoh decision thus gave important additional protection to those living under Australian jurisdiction.","Asia, Australia",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/28/indonesia-escape-suspected-ngo-killers","Indonesia- Escape of Suspected NGO Killers","Indonesia: Escape of Suspected NGO Killers","","03/28/2001","(New York) Human Rights Watch expressed outrage over reports yesterday that four suspects in the killings of NGO workers in Aceh had escaped from detention in Medan, North Sumatra. The international monitoring group called for an immediate investigation by the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission into the circumstances surrounding the reported escape and asked the government to provide tangible evidence that the remaining four suspects, all members of the Indonesian army, are still in custody.   """"This was a test case for the capacity of the government to prosecute human rights violators. If the security forces can't even hold high-profile thugs like these, what hope is there for justice in Indonesia?"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"If the reports are true, this escape means that no civilian between Medan and Lhokseumawe is safe. The men who ran were guns for hire, and now they're guns for hire with a grudge."""" The Medan newspaper Waspada reported yesterday that the four had escaped five days ago.  The December 2000 murders for which the men were detained became one of the highest profile cases in recent years because of the involvement of the army, the survival of a key eyewitness, and the nature of the work the victims were doing. All were young volunteer fieldworkers for the North Aceh branch of a nongovernmental organization called Rehabilitation Action for Torture Victims in Aceh or RATA.  On December 6, 2000, while in a clearly-marked RATA vehicle, they were stopped on the road by a group of armed men, including both civilians and soldiers. After stopping at several army posts, their captors took them to an abandoned house outside the town of Lhokseumawe in Aceh and executed them. One RATA worker managed to escape and provided information to police that led later in December to the arrest of eight men. Four were civilian informers for the military, known as cuak: Ampon Thaib Geudong, 48, known as Teunku Pon; Abdullah bin Yusuf, known as Guru, 37; Maimun, known as Buyung, 44, and Madiah, 44. These are the four who escaped from the North Sumatra provincial command of the Mobile Police Brigade (Brimob) in Medan last Thursday.  The army detainees, reportedly in custody in the Bukit Barisan regional military command in Medan, are Maj. Jerry Patras, head of intelligence for military resort (Korem) 011 in Lhokseumawe and three of his subordinates, Sgt. Slamet Jawa, Sgt. Ermanto, and Lt. Harry Ruman.  """"Someone should verify whether these men are still in custody or whether they, too, have vanished,"""" said Jones. She noted that in another high-profile murder in 1999 in Aceh where the army had opened fire at a religious school killing more than fifty people, the commander in charge disappeared and was never prosecuted for the killings. Twenty-four others were convicted.  """"The men who escaped were the Acehnese equivalent of militia leaders in East Timor,"""" said Jones. """"They were army-backed goons, and we find it odd that they escaped just as the army and police are embarking on a new military offensive in Aceh.""""  Coincidentally, Human Rights Watch last Friday sent a letter to Attorney General Marzuki Darusman asking for a clarification of the detainees' legal status. The Indonesian National Human Rights Commission had planned to use the RATA killings as a test case before a new human rights court established in Medan on March 12. The Banda Aceh police, who had arrested and investigated the eight suspects, turned the case over to the High Court in Aceh in late February for prosecution in a koneksitas court, a hybrid court involving both civilian and military judges. In the latter court, the eight would be tried for pre-meditated murder.  In a human rights court, they could be prosecuted for the much more serious charge of crimes against humanity if it could be shown the killings were part of a broader pattern of state-sponsored abuse. The Attorney General claimed that if he took the case away from the police and turned it over to National Human Rights Commission for prosecution in the new court, he would have to release the men pending their re-investigation on the new charges. The dispute over jurisdiction was unresolved at the time of the escape.","Asia, Indonesia",""

Israeli security forces have committed by far the most serious and systematic violations. We documented excessive and indiscriminate use of lethal force, arbitrary killings, and collective punishment, including willful destruction of property and severe restrictions on movement that far exceed any possible military necessity.  The Israeli government refuses to investigate alleged violations committed during """"war-like situations,"""" in contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law.  Consider the killing of fourteen-year old `Ala Mahfouz. Last October, `Ala was watching clashes from the roof of his family home when he threw a stone that hit an Israeli soldier in the face. The soldier was evacuated, but a second soldier waited outside `Ala's home for more than an hour. When `Ala walked onto his balcony drinking a cup of tea, the soldier shot him in the forehead from a distance of fifteen meters. Soldiers then fired rubber bullets at `Ala's father and two neighbors as they tried to evacuate the boy, hitting all of them. `Ala died in a hospital. The soldier who shot him remained on duty, and witnesses told us that he openly boasted about the killing, and threatened to kill others in the household.  Soldiers enforcing Israel's closure policy regularly stop Palestinian cars, beat and humiliate the drivers and passengers, and slash tires or confiscate keys. Even ambulances are not safe from these attacks. An emergency medical technician told us soldiers at a checkpoint prevented his ambulance from reaching an injured youth until he promised to hand the victim over to the soldiers. When he returned without the victim, soldiers threatened to beat or kill the medical team until a commander intervened and let them go. Israeli soldiers in Hebron told us that it wasn't their job to protect unarmed Palestinians from settlers who have stoned cars and homes, damaged shops, crops, or poisoned water supplies, and set up ad hoc road roadblocks. In December, the army allowed settlers to take over the home of `Atta Jaber to hold prayer services there. The settlers maliciously destroyed the home's interior walls and burned its contents before the soldiers finally executed a court order to remove them. The army then took over the home themselves, causing additional damage and allowing the settlers to hold a Hanukkah service there. It took the family a month to obtain a second court order evicting the army.  The Palestinian Authority is also implicated in serious violations. It has failed to prevent Palestinian gunmen from firing on settlements from civilian areas, and does not appear to have investigated or prosecuted cases where Israeli civilians have been killed or seriously injured. One gunman told us that he received daily orders from Fatah regarding what areas to fire from and what settlements to target.  Palestinian security forces have detained large numbers of Palestinians accused of collaborating with Israel, sometimes on the basis of actions taken years earlier. Two of these alleged collaborators have been executed and at least three others sentenced to death after summary trials. At least one alleged collaborator, Salim al-Akra, has died in custody.  Mr. Chairperson, It is clear that Israel and the Palestinian Authority have been unwilling to fulfill their responsibilities and obligations under international human rights and humanitarian law standards. Israel has also refused to cooperate with the Commission's human rights mechanisms.  Human Rights Watch therefore calls on the Commission to: 1. Urge the Security Council to immediately establish a permanent international presence in the West Bank and Gaza to monitor and report regularly on the compliance by all parties with international human rights and humanitarian law standards. We regret Tuesday's veto by the United States in the Security Council to such a proposal and urge it to reconsider its position.  2. Request the Secretary General to ensure that appropriate UN mechanisms report to and inform the Security Council and the General Assembly on a regular basis regarding compliance by all parties with human rights and international humanitarian law standards in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  In addition, Human Rights Watch calls on member states that are High Contracting Parties of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 to: 1.

Human Rights Watch charged that Israeli security forces have committed the most serious abuses, including indiscriminate and excessive use of lethal force, arbitrary killings, and collective punishment on a wide scale. The organization said that Israel has refused to investigate alleged violations committed by its forces, in contravention of international human rights and humanitarian law, and has refused to cooperate with the Commission's human rights mechanisms, including the Human Rights Inquiry Commission.  """"Many of these violations may also amount to grave breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention,"""" Megally said.

Human Rights Watch expressed concern about the treatment of large numbers of Palestinians detained for alleged collaboration with Israel, sometimes on the basis of actions taken years earlier. Two alleged collaborators have been executed after summary trials, and at least one has died in custody.  The United States has so far refused to consider the proposed international presence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, citing Israeli opposition to such an initiative.

Both Gen. Julio Salazar Monroe, former head of Peru's disbanded National Intelligence Service (SIN), and retired Gen. Juan Rivera Lazo, former head of the Army Intelligence Service (SIE) have been linked to the """"Colina Group,"""" an army death squad responsible for the Barrios Altos massacre, and other human rights atrocities in the early 1990s. Two other alleged former death squad members, Juan Pampa Quilla and Wilson Carbajal Garcia, were also reportedly detained.  """"The wall of impunity that held firm in Peru for a decade is beginning to crumble,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. The arrests followed a historic March 20 decision of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights declaring two 1995 amnesty laws incompatible with the American Convention on Human Rights, and hence without legal effect. The ruling obligated Peru to bring those responsible for the massacre to justice. In 1999, former President Alberto Fujimori, who fled the country last year, illegally withdrew Peru's recognition of the court. In January of this year, Peru formally returned to its jurisdiction. Interim president Valentín Paniagua has recognized the state's responsibility for the massacre, and pledged to carry out the court decision. Peruvian police are now searching for the leader of the death squad, retired Maj. Santiago Martin Rivas, and some ten other former members of the group.  The international monitoring group commended the Peruvian government for the speed with which it responded to the Inter-American Court's decision. """"The court has established a precedent for the whole region. Presidents may pass amnesty laws, violate human rights treaties and shun international human rights courts. But these arrests show that, in the end, justice prevails,"""" said Vivanco.  On November 3 1991, armed men wearing ski-masks burst into a fund-raising party in the poor Barrios Altos district of Lima and machine-gunned to death fifteen people after ordering them to lie on the floor. Four survived with serious injuries.  Rivas and other members of the death squad were detained and convicted in 1994 by a military court for a separate human rights atrocity, the abduction and secret execution of nine students and a teacher from La Cantuta University in 1992. While serving their sentence in privileged conditions in a military prison, they were charged in April 1995 for the Barrios Altos massacre. Two months later, however, the government of Alberto Fujimori suddenly passed a law granting a sweeping amnesty to military or police personnel convicted or implicated in human rights crimes during the counter-insurgency war. When the prosecutor and judge challenged the law, Peru's Congress rapidly passed another law enforcing its observance. Rivas and the others were immediately set free. He and other members of the group are now accused of further human rights crimes they committed after their release.","Americas, Peru","International Justice"

School authorities rarely challenge the perpetrators, and many girls interrupt their education or leave school altogether because they feel vulnerable to sexual assault, Human Rights Watch said.   """"Girls are learning that sexual violence and abuse are an inescapable part of going to school every day -- so they don't go,"""" said Erika George, counsel to the Academic Freedom Program at Human Rights Watch and the author of the report. """"South African officials say they're committed to educational equality. If they mean it, they must address the problem of sexual violence in schools, without delay.""""   The 138-page report, """"Scared at School: Sexual Violence Against Girls in South African Schools,"""" is based on extensive interviews with victims, their parents, teachers, and school administrators in KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, and the Western Cape. It documents how girls are raped, sexually abused, sexually harassed, and assaulted at school by their male classmates and even by their teachers.   According to the report, girls have been attacked in school toilet facilities, in empty classrooms and corridors, hostel rooms and dormitories. Teachers can misuse their authority to sexually abuse girls, sometimes reinforcing sexual demands with threats of corporal punishment or promises of better grades, or even money.   Human Rights Watch called on the South African government and its National Department of Education to develop a national plan of action to address the problem of school-based sexual violence, in broad cooperation with students, parents, teachers, and school administrators.   The South African government has acknowledged the problem's severity and made significant efforts to improve the state response to violence against women. But the Human Rights Watch report found that school officials still fail to protect their girl pupils from rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment. The government does not even collect data on the incidence of sexual violence and harassment occurring in schools, or the number of girls who leave school due to such violence.   While it is mandatory to report child abuse in South Africa, girls who report sexual abuse generally receive hostile or indifferent responses from school authorities. According to the report, schools often promise to handle matters internally, and urge girls' families not to alert police or draw publicity to problems.   The South African government has constitutional and international legal obligations to protect women and girls from violence. International human rights treaties that South Africa has ratified, as well as national legislation, require the government to provide all children an education that is free from discrimination on the basis of sex. Failure to prevent and redress persistent gender-based violence in schools operates as a discriminatory deprivation of the right to education for girls.   """"South Africa needs a systematic strategy to address the problem,"""" George said. """"Leadership at every level is vital to create an education system free of gender bias and sexual violence.""""   Human Rights Watch urged the government to adopt and disseminate a set of standard procedural guidelines governing how schools are to address allegations of sexual violence and explaining how schools should treat victims, and perpetrators, of violence.   Attached are stories of schoolgirls from the new Human Rights Watch report on sexual violence in South Africa´s schools.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Schoolgirls´ Stories From the New Human Rights Watch Report on Sexual Violence in South Africa´s Schools  P.C., fifteen, was thinking about dropping out of school when she was interviewed by Human Rights Watch in March 2000. PC had been struggling to perform academically after she was sexually assaulted by her teacher at a Johannesburg school. “My grades are horrible. I´m not doing well because I missed so much school.”   P.C. told how her trust in her teacher was shattered when instead of helping her with Afrikaans homework, the teacher asked her to start a “dating relationship” and propositioned her for sex. “He asked me to take off my shirt but if part of my school uniform was still on I would look sexy,” she said. P.C. told Human Rights Watch that the teacher sexually assaulted her before her parents arrived to pick her up from school.   “I told him to stop. I told him it was time for my parents to come get me. My parents came ten minutes later. My mother asked me, ‘how was your Afrikaans lesson?´ I didn´t go back to school for one month after…everything reminds me of what happened.”   Although P.C.´s teacher is on leave from the school pending his criminal trial for the statutory rape of another student, P.C. is fearful and still does not feel comfortable at her school. “I don´t want to be there [at school]. I just don´t care anymore. I thought about changing schools, but why? If it can happen here it can happen any place. I didn´t want to go back to any school.”   W.H., thirteen, excelled as a top student at an exclusive school in Johannesburg and aspired to be a lawyer. When Human Rights Watch interviewed her in March 2000, she was too intimidated by the presence of her attackers to return to school. “I left school because I was raped by two guys in my class who were supposedly my friends.”   W.H. told Human Rights Watch the boys would seek her out to harass and taunt her during breaks in class. School officials and teachers did not help W.H. or act to stop the harassment. Other students also started to tease her and call her a “liar.” Unable to cope with the constant harassment from her classmates and the indifference of the school administration, W.H. left school a week after she reported the rape to school officials and police.   When we interviewed W.H., she had not attended school for several months. She told us, “My mom asked me if I wanted to go back to school. I said no. I didn´t want to go. All the people who I thought were my friends had turned against me. And they [the rapists] were still there. I felt disappointed. [Teachers] always told me they were glad to have students like me, that they wished they had more students like me. If they had made the boys leave, I wouldn´t have felt so bad about it.”","Africa, South Africa","Health, Women's Rights, Sexual and Reproductive Health"

On March 21, Indonesia's parliament formally approved special courts to prosecute the 1999 crimes in East Timor, as well as cases stemming from a massacre by security forces of Muslim protesters in Tanjung Priok, the port area of Jakarta, in 1984. Under Indonesian law, establishment of the courts now awaits only action by the president.  """"The parliament's action removes a huge obstacle to justice, but the real question is when we will see actual trials begin,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"Not only do we need the President to issue a decree, but we also need the Attorney-General to issue indictments and the Supreme Court to appoint judges for the new courts. Unless all of that happens quickly, skepticism about Indonesia's will to confront the military about human rights abuse is just going to grow deeper.""""  Indonesian justice groups have long demanded a tribunal for the crimes committed in East Timor after the independence referendum there on August 30, 1999. In January 2000, separate international and Indonesian commissions of inquiry concluded that systematic rights abuses had taken place, and that Indonesian military officials and the militia leaders they organized and trained were responsible for the crimes. The international inquiry team, set up at the request of United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and under the auspices of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, called for an international tribunal to be set up to try the crimes.  The international community ultimately did not push for immediate establishment of such a tribunal, deferring instead to Indonesia's assertion that it would see that justice be done in Indonesian courts. Indonesia's failure until now to take meaningful steps toward prosecution of the crimes has led to renewed calls for an international tribunal, a demand likely to be echoed in coming weeks at the annual meeting of the U.N. Commission for Human Rights in Geneva.  The Tanjung Priok incident, in which troops opened fire on Muslim protestors in 1984, has long been a symbol in Indonesia of the alleged second-class status and political powerlessness of Muslim groups. Although the overwhelming majority of Indonesia's citizens are Muslim and the country is today led by a moderate Muslim cleric, Muslim political forces were marginalized during the first two decades of Soeharto's rule. Since the ouster of Soeharto in May 1998, pressure has mounted for justice for the Tanjung Priok crimes.  * * A copy of the Human Rights Watch letter to President Wahid is below.  March 23, 2001  Via Facsimile  His Excellency Abdurrahman Wahid President Republic of Indonesia  Dear President Wahid:  We understand that the Indonesian parliament, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat, today approved the setting up of special human rights courts to prosecute human rights crimes committed in East Timor in 1999 and Tanjung Priok in 1984. This is a step that the international human rights community has long been awaiting. We urge that you immediately issue a presidential decree (Keppres), pursuant to Law 26/2000 on human rights courts, establishing the courts.  As many of our Indonesian colleagues have emphasized, establishing accountability for past abuses by security forces in Indonesia and East Timor and ending the cycle of impunity are essential to Indonesia's democratization process. The delay of over a year in coming up with indictments against some of the individuals named in the January 31, 2000 KPP-HAM report as perpetrators of the 1999 scorched earth campaign in East Timor has raised serious concerns about Indonesia's will to move forward with prosecutions. Your speedy issuance of the necessary decree may allay some of those concerns, but until indictments are issued and trials begin, skepticism on the part of both international and domestic advocates of reform is likely to remain high.  We also urge that, once the courts are established, you do all in your power to ensure that the courts have the resources they need to perform their duties professionally and that the judges appointed are truly independent. We also respectfully request that you take the lead in urging the People's Consultative Assembly to further amend the constitution to make it clear that the amendment passed last August banning retroactive application of laws does not apply to gross rights violations, such as those alleged in East Timor and Tanjung Priok. We agree fully with those Indonesian legal experts who have argued that such a new amendment is necessary to avert the possibility that the special courts could be rendered powerless on a legal technicality: the constitution should unambiguously state that the ban on retroactive application of the law is not violated by acts that constituted internationally recognized crimes at the time the acts were perpetrated.  Establishment of human rights courts for East Timor and Tanjung Priok is not the end of the road, but a necessary beginning. We urge that you seize this historic opportunity.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/23/letter-marzuki-darusman-attorney-general-republic-indonesia","Letter to Marzuki Darusman Attorney-General Republic of Indonesia","Letter to Marzuki Darusman, Attorney-General, Republic of Indonesia","","03/23/2001","Via Facsimile Mr. Marzuki Darusman Attorney General Republic of Indonesia Dear Pak Marzuki, We are concerned that efforts to try suspects in the RATA killings in the newly established human rights court are falling afoul of a legal technicality, and we believe that you as Attorney General may have the power to ensure that this technicality is overcome. But we are also concerned that your office is presenting the case as a stark choice between keeping the suspects in detention and prosecuting them in a court that lacks credibility, or releasing them pending investigation under the new human rights legislation. We would very much appreciate clarification as to why the suspects cannot be kept in detention while the latter option is explored. As you know, the case involves the December 6, 2000 murder of three humanitarian workers in North Aceh by a group of armed civilians and military officers. The three were volunteers for Rehabilitation Action for Torture Victims in Aceh (RATA), a nongovernmental organization. Eight men, four civilians and four army officers, including the head of intelligence for the regional military command in Aceh, Korem 011, were arrested about ten days after the murders and have been in detention ever since. The case was originally investigated by the provincial police in Aceh as a criminal case of premeditated murder. As such, and because it involved both civilians and soldiers, it would have to be tried by a so-called koneksitas court involving both civilian and military judges. The only previous experience of Acehnese with a koneksitas court was the Bantaqiah trial last May, which ended with twenty-four guilty verdicts of ordinary soldiers but without any real effort to find, let alone prosecute, the lieutenant colonel in charge of the operation. This means that for the all-important goal of having Acehnese believe that justice can be done by an Indonesian court, the koneksitas option starts out with a major credibility problem. The alternative was to use the RATA murders as the first case to be tried under legislation passed by the Indonesian parliament on November 23, setting up new human rights courts to try the most severe cases of human rights violations, including genocide and crimes against humanity. The new law gives the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas-HAM) the power to investigate human rights cases, as opposed to the police who are the investigators in ordinary criminal cases. The provincial police completed their investigation of the RATA case on February 21, 2001 and turned the dossier over to the provincial prosecutor in Banda Aceh. At the time, he said it would be a few months before a koneksitas trial would begin. In the meantime, we understand that the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas-HAM) appealed to you to take the case out of the prosecutor's hands and turn it over to them for investigation as a serious human rights case. We understand that both you and the police maintain that if the case were turned over to Komnas-HAM, the police would be obliged to release the suspects because there would be no legal ground for their detention. In addition, if they were released, they would almost certainly go into hiding and there would be no guarantee they could ever be found. Indonesian human rights lawyers say that while there is no precedent for the police turning a trial-ready case over to Komnas-HAM for investigation under the new law, there is no legal reason why the men could not be kept in detention within the time limits set by Indonesian law, since the law gives you powers of detention during the investigation phase. The relationship between human rights courts and the regular courts is going to have to be worked out anyway; you have a chance here to clarify how cases can be transferred from the latter to the former, and in the process, serve the cause of justice. We can understand why the police would want to retain control of this case. They have been struggling to assert themselves vis-à-vis the army in Aceh, they may be proud of having caught and detained senior army suspects in a high-profile case, and they may be genuinely worried that the men could be released on a legal technicality. Since the human rights courts are not yet functional, despite the law being in place, and since appointment of the courts' judges awaits action by the Supreme Court, they may also believe that prosecution in a flawed koneksitas court is better than long delayed justice in a human rights court. But there is also deep concern among human rights defenders that if the RATA murders are not tried in a human rights court, not only will there be no true justice for the victims and their families, but there will also be no strong deterrent against future attacks on human rights and humanitarian workers. We agree that the worst option would be to let the suspects go free; a trial in a koneksitas court would be preferable to no trial at all. The question is whether in fact the choice must come down to that. We look forward to your response.

On the morning of March 20, the Pakistani government launched the third wave of mass political arrests since the October 1999 coup. The arrests apparently were made to forestall a rally planned for March 23 by the multiparty Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD). """"With crackdowns like this one, it's hard to see how Pakistani authorities expect their claims of progress to be taken seriously,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director of the Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. Police began detaining members of the parties that belonged to the ARD in raids on their homes at dawn, reportedly using lists of party members that had been compiled in advance. The search operations continued into the evening in Lahore, Pakistan's second largest city, and in neighboring districts of Punjab. As of Tuesday night, police claimed to have arrested between 150 and 250 persons in the raids. According to ARD leaders, 200 party members had been detained in Lahore alone and some 2,500 throughout Punjab.  Among those detained Tuesday were Khwaja Ahmad Ahsan, the former mayor of Lahore from the Pakistan Muslim League; Rai Ejaz Ahmad, the division president of the Pakistan People's Party (PPP); and Aslam Gill, a former Lahore president of the PPP. According to ARD leaders, police in several cases detained family members of persons whom they were unable to locate. Among them was the sister of Sajida Mir, the current Lahore president of the PPP. Scores of political party leaders and activists in the province have reportedly gone into hiding. Most of the detentions were carried out under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) ordinance, which prohibits speech that """"causes or is likely to cause fear or alarm to the public,"""" or which """"furthers or is likely to further any activity prejudicial to public safety or the maintenance of public order."""" A legal aid committee established by the ARD filed a habeas corpus petition Tuesday in the Lahore High Court challenging the detention of party members under the ordinance. In making the arrests, the police were preemptively enforcing an Interior Ministry order of March 2000 that prohibits all political meetings held in public places, political strikes, and processions.  """"The standing ban on rallies violates rights to freedoms of expression and assembly under Pakistan's constitution and international human rights law,"""" Jones said. """"Its repeal is essential to the resumption of democratic processes in Pakistan."""" The rally planned by the Alliance was scheduled to take place near Mochi Gate in Lahore on March 23, a national holiday known as Pakistan Day. ARD leaders were widely expected to deliver speeches at the rally calling on the government to hold elections to the national and provincial assemblies that were suspended in the immediate aftermath of the coup. The ARD, formed on December 3, 2000, brought together the PML and the PPP, Pakistan's two largest political parties, in a rare alliance. But its effectiveness has been limited by a split in the PML between loyalists of deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif and dissidents, tacitly supported by the government, who are opposed to the party's membership in the ARD. Most of those arrested in the raids Tuesday were members of the PPP.","Asia, Pakistan",""

Soydas's death comes on the 150th day of a death fast staged by four hundred prisoners in Turkey's newly opened F-type prisons. The prisoners are protesting the imposition of a regime of small group isolation in the new prisons. """"This was an avoidable crisis and an avoidable fatality,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia Division of Human Rights Watch. """"For eighteen months we have been pressing the Turkish government to abandon the isolation regime in the new prisons.""""  On December 19, 2000, the Turkish security forces carried out a violent military operation to transfer more than a thousand prisoners from traditional wards holding sixty or more prisoners to the new F-type high security prisons based on single-person or three-person units. Prisoners resisted the transfer, at least in part because they feared that an isolation regime would be imposed on them, and would make them more vulnerable to ill-treatment. Twenty-eight prisoners and two gendarmes were killed in the operation and many injured. Gendarmes beat, tortured, and sexually assaulted prisoners during the transfer. Since that date, prisoners have been locked down in a monotonous physical environment, where they are limited to contact with their two cellmates.  Solitary and small group isolation is physically and mentally damaging and may amount to cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. Impaired vision and hearing, hallucinations, tinnitus, lowering of the immune system, amenorrhea, premature menopause, depression, anxiety and aggressive behavior are among the effects documented in studies on prisoners, volunteers and animals.  In May 2000, Human Rights Watch delegates visited the Turkish Justice Ministry, asking that a humane regime be established for the F-type prisons before they were opened.  The Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT), part of the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member, visited the F-type prisons in January. It has repeatedly pressed the Turkish government to ensure that the new cell-based regime is accompanied by a program of out-of-cell activities, and monitoring mechanisms to ensure that prisoners are not subjected to ill-treatment in the privacy of their cells.  The Justice Ministry has suggested that it might comply with the CPT's recommendations, but has taken no steps to do so. """"Once the brutal transfers had been accomplished,"""" said Cartner, """"the Turkish government remained deaf to all appeals to bring the F-type prisons in line with international standards."""" Human Rights Watch again called on the Turkish government to ensure that prisoners are permitted to leave their units daily for out-of-cell activities and association with other prisoners, and to permit broad access to the prisons by bar associations and the Turkish Medical Association as a safeguard against ill-treatment. The organization also calls on the Council of Europe to use its authority to press for compliance with the CPT's recommendations.  Twenty-nine year old Cengiz Soydas was a university student, detained in 1995 and sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment for membership in a violent left-wing organization.

The 40-page report, """"The 'Dirty War' in Chechnya: Forced Disappearances, Torture and Summary Executions,"""" details the cases of fifty-two """"disappeared"""" individuals who were last seen in the custody of Russian federal forces. Human Rights Watch believes the actual number of """"disappeared"""" is much higher. The mutilated bodies of some of the """"disappeared"""" were later found in unmarked graves in Chechnya, most bearing unmistakable signs of torture. Human Rights Watch said that European governments should act decisively at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, currently convening in Geneva, to ensure that an international commission of inquiry is formed to investigate human rights abuse in Chechnya.  The term """"dirty war"""" was coined to describe the campaigns of forced """"disappearances"""" perpetrated by Latin American governments in the 1970s and 80s.  """"Russia's war in Chechnya is certainly a 'dirty war,'"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"The Russians have had plenty of time to investigate and prosecute these cases, but they haven't done so. It's time for the international community to act.""""  In a typical """"disappearance,"""" federal agents-from the Russian military, police, or security forces-take someone into custody during """"sweep"""" operations or at a checkpoint. But Russian authorities later deny any knowledge of the individual who has """"disappeared.""""  Family members may visit detention centers all over the northern Caucasus to glean information about their loved ones. Often they are compelled to bribe prison guards to scan prisoners' lists for the name of the """"disappeared,"""" or to pay middlemen who claim to have connections to authorities.  Russian legal authorities offer little help. The civilian procuracy charged with investigating such cases cannot compel the military authorities to cooperate. The thirty-four criminal investigations into """"disappearances"""" that the civilian procuracy has opened so far have not resulted in the discovery of the whereabouts of any """"disappeared,"""" or in any indictments of perpetrators.  The Human Rights Watch report documents eight mass graves and eight other makeshift burials, where corpses of the """"disappeared"""" and others have been found.  Among the victims whose cases are detailed in the report: Akhmed Zaurbekov and Khamzad Khasarov, who were detained on January 14, 2001. Local authorities denied all knowledge of their whereabouts. Two weeks later, their corpses were found in a rock quarry.  Nina Lulueva and her two cousins, who were detained on June 3, 2000, were selling strawberries at a market in Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, when they were detained by masked armed men. Her husband, a judge, searched for information on her whereabouts among all levels of law enforcement. Her corpse was found early this month in a mass grave near the Khankala military base.  Two minors, Islam Dombaev and Murat Lyanov were detained, together with eighteen-year-old Timur Tabzhanov on June 28, 2000. Although police documents record their initial detention, their relations, after an exhaustive search, have been unable to obtain information about their whereabouts.

Human Rights Commission in Geneva to give high priority to a draft international convention on protecting all persons form forced """"disappearances.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

The World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will take place in South Africa from August 31 to September 7, 2001.  """"This conference is a significant opportunity for the international community to address the situation of South Asia's 240 million Dalits, or so-called untouchables,"""" said Smita Narula, senior researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"In much of Asia, little regard will be paid to this conference if it does not effectively address this problem."""" The rights group decried efforts by the Indian government to sabotage the efforts of Indian NGOs to raise awareness of the caste struggle at preparatory meetings in the lead-up to the conference, including the recently concluded Asian preparatory meeting in Tehran. The situation of Dalits stands alone as the only issue to have been systematically cut out of the conference's intergovernmental process so far.  """"Although South Africa's apartheid was effectively challenged by the international community, South Asia's 'hidden apartheid' continues to condemn Dalits or """"untouchables"""" to a lifetime of slavery, segregation, exploitation, and violence,"""" Narula added. """"Its place in international consciousness is long overdue.""""  India actively supported the anti-apartheid struggle, has ratified all major human rights conventions, and has enacted progressive legislation to tackle caste-related problems of bonded labor, manual scavenging, untouchability, and other atrocities against Dalit community members. Much of the legislation, however, remains completely unenforced. Laws are openly flouted and state complicity in attacks on Dalit communities has become a well-documented pattern. Caste-based abuse is also rampant in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Japan, and parts of Western Africa. The Indian attorney general and many other Indian officials have erroneously argued that this is a conference about racism, and not other forms of discrimination. The very title of the conference undercuts this argument, as do conclusions drawn by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination that the situation of Dalits """"falls within the scope of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,"""" and that the term """"descent"""" contained in Article 1 of the Convention does not refer solely to race, and encompasses the situation of Dalits.  The government has also argued that efforts to raise the caste issue are part of an """"external agenda."""" Their position conveniently ignores the efforts of hundreds of Indian human rights groups who in December 1999 collectively submitted over 2.5 million signatures to the Indian Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee demanding the abolishment of untouchability and urging U.N. bodies to squarely address the issue of caste-based abuse and discrimination.  Activists from around the world, including anti-apartheid activists in South Africa and African-American activists in the United States, have already begun to support the Dalit struggle. Given the magnitude and severity of this problem in Asia, the international monitoring group called on the international community to ensure that caste-based and similar discrimination against marginalized populations in Asia be explicitly addressed in the draft declaration and programme of action of the WCAR. Dalits, Burakumin in Japan, and other populations in similar situations, it added, should be explicitly acknowledged as groups of people who have been subject to perennial and persistent forms of discrimination and abuse on the basis of their descent.  Human Rights Watch has also repeatedly called attention to the pervasive racism and intolerance afflicting millions of migrants and refugees uprooted by economic developments and political strife and racial discrimination in the determination of nationality and citizenship rights. In the post-apartheid era, de facto rather than de jure discrimination takes on immense significance. The discriminatory effect of racist practices in criminal justice, public policy and administrative practice cannot be ignored.","Global",""

The proposed reforms, which would put an end to the special legal protection public officials now enjoy against defamation, were specifically called for in Human Rights Watch's recently published report on freedom of expression in Chile.   """"As a sign of Chile's democratic maturity, it is time for Chilean lawmakers to forgo their long-accustomed privileges against criticism,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"These reforms would allow a genuinely open public debate.""""  Articles 263, 264 and 265 of the Criminal Code cover insults to a broad range of public authorities, including the president, members of Congress, judges, ministers of state or """"other authorities in exercise of their office."""" In its 45-page report, titled Progress Stalled: Setbacks in Freedom of Expression Reform, Human Rights Watch urged the Chilean government to repeal these provisions as well as the defamation provisions of the State Security Law. Both sets of laws, explained the report, serve the same purpose of inhibiting criticism and restraining the public debate.  The announced reforms supplement a proposal, awaiting approval in the legislature since 1999, to repeal sections of the State Security Law which criminalize strongly-worded criticism of public authorities, including government ministers, Supreme Court justices, members of Congress and the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces. The government has said that the State Security Law reforms, which are part of a comprehensive bill on press freedoms, should clear Congress in April. It intends to present the Criminal Code reforms to Congress by the end of the year.  To date, objections in Congress have prevented the enactment of any reform of Chile's extensive and anachronistic laws limiting free speech.  On March 13, delegates of Human Rights Watch, accompanied by the President of the Inter-American Press Association, Danilo Arbilla, held a one-hour meeting with President Lagos to discuss the organization's concerns.  """"We were very encouraged by President Lagos' receptivity to our comments and criticisms. He has since acknowledged publicly that Chile has enormous ground to make up on freedom of expression,"""" said Vivanco.  In addition to the repeal of defamation provisions, the Chilean government has said it also intends to carry out a thorough review of privacy laws to ensure that they do not bar journalists from investigating matters involving a public interest. The Criminal Code introduced in 1995 currently imposes sweeping restrictions on investigative journalism by barring any intrusion into the privacy of public figures.

Bush should use his Oval Office meeting this Thursday [March 22] with Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen to press for concrete progress on human rights in advance of the president's visit to China later this year. Bush will attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Shanghai, October 20-21, and will also visit Beijing.  """"China's human rights situation has taken such a turn for the worse that Bush is going to have to address the issue head on,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch's Asia division. """"The message should be that U.S. pressure to end human rights violations is not going to stop until restrictions on basic freedoms of association, assembly, and expression are eased."""" Human Rights Watch said that those restrictions had led to many of the abuses outlined in the State Department's highly critical report of China's human rights practices, issued last month, and were a primary reason for the U.S. decision to sponsor a resolution critical of China at the annual session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights that opened March 19 in Geneva.The abuses included the arbitrary detention of thousands for their peaceful political and religious beliefs, in many cases without any judicial process whatsoever; controls on Internet usage, directed in particular against the exchange of information between those in China and those living abroad; suppression of labor activism; and an ongoing crackdown on unauthorized religious activities. """"As long as those abuses continue, neither the Bush administration nor any other government should assume that China's acceptance of the terms of two international human rights treaties indicates any real change in practice,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Last month, China ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, but indicated it would not be bound by the provisions relating to workers' right to organize and join unions of their choice. The U.S. signed the treaty in 1977 but has yet to ratify it. China signed but has not yet ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a treaty the U.S. ratified in 1992. Bush should use the meeting with Qian to pursue an invitation extended by China in March 1999 for a visit by the U.S. Secretary of Labor and seek to schedule a trip by Elaine Chao some time before the APEC summit.  """"This is an opportunity to begin a high level dialogue on protection of core worker rights, as well as to offer help in creating the kind of social safety nets that can enhance the protection of social and economic rights more generally,"""" said Jendrzejczyk. Rural healthcare and education have deteriorated noticeably in recent years, and there are no systems in place to provide insurance for laid?off or pensioned workers. Human Rights Watch warned the Bush administration against any effort by Qian Qichen to offer resumption of a bilateral human rights dialogue in exchange for a U.S. agreement to drop its sponsorship of the resolution in Geneva. China suspended the dialogue in May 1999 after the NATO bombing of its embassy in Belgrade. """"If the human rights situation in China warrants international criticism, that criticism should be forthcoming, regardless of whatever bilateral issues are on the agenda,"""" Jendrzejczyk said.  Human Rights Watch also called on Bush to move quickly, in conjunction with Congressional leaders, to appoint members of the bilateral Congressional-Executive commission on China mandated by the legislation enacted last year granting Beijing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR.) The commission is to be composed of both Senators and U.S. Representatives, plus executive branch officials chosen by the president. It is charged with monitoring human rights, labor rights and religious freedom, conducting rule of law programs, making policy recommendations, and carrying out other initiatives. Its first report is due this October. Bush should ask Qian Qichen to cooperate with the commission, and to favorably consider any request by the commission to visit China in advance of the president's October trip.","Asia, China and Tibet",""

Victims and their supporters protested the decision, which they said flew in the face of international law, and immediately announced that they would continue to seek Habré's trial in Senegal or elsewhere. """"This wrongheaded ruling will not end the quest for justice,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations that initiated the criminal action against Habré. """"If Senegal will not put Habré on trial for his atrocities, we will ask it to hand him over to a country that will."""" """"Today's decision is a disappointment and a step backwards for the rule of law, """" said the Senegalese lawyer, Sidiki Kaba, who is the president of the International Federation of Human Rights Leagues (FIDH). Senegal's President Abdoulaye Wade has said that if there is to be a trial of Habré, it should be in Chad or in countries like France or the United States which backed Habré's 1982-1990 rule. Brody said that the victims were actively exploring avenues for Habré's extradition for trial in a third country. He also noted that Habré's trial in Senegal on related charges of crimes against humanity was still possible. Last February, a magistrate initiated an investigation for crimes against humanity in Chad, a probe that remains open. The victims will also file a petition with the United Nations Committee against Torture. In its ruling today, a three-judge panel of the Cour de Cassation, Senegal's highest court, said that Senegal had no jurisdiction to pursue crimes not committed in Senegal. Human rights organizations said that the decision flouted Senegal's legal obligation under the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, to prosecute alleged torturers who enter its territory. Under the Senegalese constitution, international treaties, once ratified, override Senegal's legal code. Habré's victims reacted harshly to today's ruling. """"After so much suffering and then so much hope, I feel betrayed by Senegalese justice,"""" said Ismael Hachim, 42, President of the Chadian Association of Victims of Political Repression and Crime (AVCRP), who spent 2 years in Habré's prison and was subject to the """"Arbatachar,"""" a frequent form of torture, in which a prisoner's four limbs were tied together behind his back, leading to loss of circulation and paralysis. """"But facts are stubborn things and the evidence of Habré's crimes is finally being presented to the world. Hissène Habré has not seen the last of his victims."""" Senegalese groups also responded with dismay. """"My country lost an opportunity to break the tragic cycle of impunity,"""" said Alioune Tine of the Dakar-based African Assembly for the Defense of Human Rights (RADDHO). """"This decision is an invitation to Africa's blood-stained tryants to plan their retirement in Senegal where no one can come after them."""" Tine said he would seek a change in Senegal's laws. Seven individual Chadians brought the case as private plaintiffs, along with the AVCRP, which represents 792 victims of Habre's brutality. In January 2000, the victims provided details of 97 cases of political killings, 142 cases of torture and 100 cases of """"disappearance"""" committed by Habré 's forces during his 1982?1990 rule. In February 2000, Judge Demba Kandji of the Dakar Regional Court indicted Habré on torture charges, and placed him under house arrest. Kandji also opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in Chad. On July 4, 2000, the Court of Appeals dismissed the charges against Habré, ruling that Senegal had not enacted legislation to implement the Convention against Torture and therefore had no jurisdiction to pursue the charges because the crimes were not committed in Senegal. The dismissal drew protests from the United Nations, Senegal's association of judges, and rights activists around the world. Habré, now 58, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing Goukouni Wedeye. Habré's one-party regime was marked by widespread abuse and campaigns against the ethnic Sara (1984), Hadjerai (1987) and the Zaghawa (1989). Habré was deposed in December 1990 and has lived in Senegal since. The exact number of Habre's victims is not known. A truth commission established by the current Chadian government accused Habre's government of 40,000 political murders and systematic torture. Habré's indictment in Senegal has already had an impact back in Chad. On October 26, 2000, the Chadian victims who initiated the case in Dakar filed criminal charges in Chadian courts against their direct torturers, many of whom remain in positions of power in Chad, for torture, murder, and """"disappearance.""""

Washington, D.C. 20530-0001 Dear Attorney General Ashcroft: Congratulations on your confirmation as Attorney General. As head of the Department of Justice, you will be in a position to play a pivotal role in ensuring respect for the basic rights of all people, citizens and non-citizens alike, who reside in the United States. We urge you to make this a key priority of your term of office. As an organization that works worldwide to promote respect for fundamental human rights, Human Rights Watch is keenly aware of the importance and scope of your new responsibilities. We wish, therefore, to take the opportunity of your assumption of office as Attorney General to set out below our principal concerns and recommendations relating to the mandate of the Justice Department, and to urge you to incorporate these into your agenda for action. As you may know, Human Rights Watch is a non-partisan, independent organization that uses research and advocacy to promote respect for internationally recognized human rights in over seventy countries in all regions of the world. We do not only address human rights issues abroad. Over the past several years, we have published several ground-breaking reports on human rights problems in the United States, including sexual abuse of women inmates, barriers to accountability for police abuse, and deprivation of the right to vote for ex-offenders under state felony disenfranchisement laws. We have also addressed such issues as racial disparities in incarceration for drug offenses, abuses by border patrol agents, and substandard conditions of confinement for children in juvenile facilities and adults in super-maximum security prisons. Within the coming weeks, we will publish a report on prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse in the United States, the product of three years of detailed and painstaking research. We are enclosing, for your review, some of our most recent reports. Under your leadership, the Department of Justice has a primary responsibility and obligation to promote and strengthen respect for human rights in the United States. It should both build upon the positive steps taken by previous administrations, Democratic and Republican, and undertake new initiatives, as proposed below, to ensure full respect for the fundamental rights of all citizens and other residents of the United States. Support the Special Litigation Section of the Department's Civil Rights Division We urge you to support the work of the Special Litigation Section of the Civil Rights Division in combating abuses by police, as well as in prisons and jails, and to ensure that the section has adequate funding and other support to enable it to fulfill its mandate. The Justice Department's power to initiate inquiries to determine whether there is a """"pattern or practice"""" of abuse and poor accountability in particular police departments has become an essential tool in combating unchecked police misconduct. The Attorney General is authorized to conduct such inquiries under provisions of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. §14141). Such inquiries, and the necessary reforms that stem from them, have led not only to improvements in the particular departments studied, but have also sent a powerful signal to all police departments about the """"best practices"""" that the Justice Department supports. While prosecutions of law enforcement officers by the Civil Rights Division are important, the civil powers allow the Justice Department, working in concert with local officials, to promote broader reforms that cannot readily be identified or addressed through criminal prosecutions of individuals. In Pittsburgh, PA, Steubenville, OH, and New Jersey, reforms have been, or are currently in the process of being, implemented following """"pattern or practice"""" inquiries undertaken by Special Litigation Section into alleged excessive use of force and racial discrimination by law enforcement authorities. Currently, the Civil Rights Division reports that it is reviewing fourteen police departments; negotiations are underway in New York City and an agreement has just been reached with the Los Angeles Police Department following inquiries in those cities. The Special Litigation Section also plays a vital role in protecting the rights of persons - both adults and children - who are confined in state and local prisons and detention facilities. As you know, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA) empowers the Attorney General to investigate conditions in public facilities and to take appropriate action if it is found that there is a pattern or practice of unlawful actions that deprives persons confined in the facilities of their constitutional or federal statutory rights. The Special Litigation Section, acting under CRIPA, has investigated hundreds of jails, prisons, juvenile correctional facilities, mental retardation and mental health facilities, and nursing homes. In many of these cases, it has secured significant reform of systemic abuses without recourse to litigation. In other cases, litigation brought by the Special Litigation Section has brought about necessary changes in policy and practice in order to end abuses. With regard to conditions in juvenile detention facilities, in particular, Human Rights Watch has cooperated closely with the Special Litigation Section, notably concerning Georgia and Louisiana, where real improvements have been achieved as a result. The Special Litigation Section has also recently opened a formal investigation into Red Onion State Prison, a super-maximum security prison in Virginia that has been the focus of considerable attention by Human Rights Watch on account of persistent reports of serious abuse of inmates. Clearly, as the number of persons incarcerated in prisons and jails continues to soar, the work of the Special Litigation Section under CRIPA, already important, will become even more crucial in ensuring that the constitutional and human rights of those incarcerated, who often lack adequate financial, legal or other means to protect their rights, are fully respected. Use federal grants to encourage reforms in U.S. police and corrections departments There is compelling evidence that some U.S. police and corrections officials employ torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading practices against those in their custody, while others tolerate or condone these practices. To address this pervasive and longstanding problem, we believe your administration should provide a reform incentive by rewarding, and by being clearly seen to reward, police and corrections departments that take concrete steps to improve accountability systems and to punish abusive officers. In the case of police departments, the Justice Department recently issued a document detailing what it considers to be the """"best practices"""" for ensuring accountability. We believe it would be appropriate, therefore, that police departments seeking federal grants should be required, as a condition of their application, to describe the steps they are taking to meet those standards, and that those departments that are taking effective steps to comply with the Justice Department recommendations should be rewarded, while those that fail to do so should be penalized or denied federal grants. As yet, the Justice Department has not developed """"best practices"""" for prisons. However, there are a number of critical areas affecting prison management - for example, relating to the use of force - in which the Department could encourage policies that will protect inmates against abuse through targeted incentive grants. Similarly, the Department could play an important leading role in combating prisoner-on-prisoner sexual abuse by drafting model investigatory procedures for such allegations. Remove barriers to civil rights prosecutions and enhance monitoring The Criminal Section is tasked with prosecuting law enforcement officials who violate the civil rights of those they are sworn to serve (18 U.S.C. §§241 and 242). Although there are many such complaints each year, such prosecutions are rare. During Fiscal Year 1999, the Civil Rights Division received more than 12,000 complaints, the majority alleging official misconduct by law enforcement officials. During the same year, more than 3,600 FBI civil rights investigations were initiated. Thirty-six grand juries were impaneled in civil rights cases involving fifty-eight law enforcement officers resulting in thirty-one convictions or guilty pleas. We welcome the efforts in these cases, but considering the figures, it is clear that only a very small percentage of allegations of civil rights violations against law enforcement officers are investigated fully and presented to a grand jury, and that of these only about half result in convictions or guilty pleas. It appears that police and correctional officers have little reason to fear such prosecutions, thus undermining the statute's possible deterrent effect. It is impossible to know, without full access to case files, whether this low rate of prosecution is justified by the circumstances of the specific cases, but these statistics do raise questions regarding adequate funding, whether investigations are sufficiently timely and thorough to support prosecutions, and whether there is the political will to pursue these cases vigorously. Consequently, we urge you to order a review of the Criminal Section's practices and policies to ensure that the section is not declining to prosecute cases that could be brought successfully. Furthermore, the review should be used to determine whether the high threshold prosecutors are required to meet in civil rights cases - interpreted as having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused officer specifically intended to deprive an individual of his or her civil rights - undermines the spirit of the law. We urge you to review this """"specific intent"""" requirement and to support any legislative efforts to revise or remove this legal standard if it is found that it is inappropriately hampering or preventing the prosecution of officers who violate individual's civil rights. It should be sufficient for prosecutors to show that a law enforcement official intentionally and unjustifiably beat, killed, or otherwise abused a victim without the additional burden of having to prove the officer specifically intended to violate the victim's civil rights. We also urge you to enhance the federal monitoring of local prosecutorial efforts against police officers. In city after city - including New Orleans, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, and Los Angeles - federal officials either failed to act or were unaware as rampant police abuses took place. For example, in Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times reviewed cases referred for possible prosecution from the LAPD to the District Attorney's office between 1995 and 2000. The District Attorney's office received one hundred allegations of possibly criminal use of excessive force by Los Angeles Police Department officers. During that period, the District Attorney fully prosecuted just one case, with the officer pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge. (Two other officers were indicted recently for beating a homeless man in 1997, with trials pending as of this writing.) At least eight of the officers eventually linked with the Rampart scandal had been the subjects of such referrals, with allegations including rape and excessive force. The District Attorney in Los Angeles recently acknowledged that the office was """"asleep at the switch"""" in relation to police corruption and brutality - inaction that allowed the abuses by the Rampart Division officers and others to flourish. Yet the U.S. Attorney's office and Civil Rights Division were no more vigorous in prosecuting such cases during this period. According to information provided by the Criminal Section to Human Rights Watch, just three LAPD officers were prosecuted for civil rights violations during Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000; none of those cases involved excessive force. According to the U.S. Attorney in the Central District of California, there is no set procedure for sharing information between the District Attorney's office and the U.S. Attorney's office. He told Human Rights Watch that the LAPD, District Attorney's office, and U.S. Attorney's office were now working on improving communication regarding cases of mutual concern, allowing the U.S. Attorney to learn about such incidents in a timely way and to consider whether they constitute civil rights violations under the federal statute. We commend this effort and urge the Criminal Section to enhance this type of information-sharing in all jurisdictions. We also suggest that, in order to play an effective role in monitoring police departments, federal officials in the Justice Department and around the country should maintain consistent contact with civilian review agencies, city attorney offices, and civil rights groups. Federal officials should collect all information possible from all sources and not remain reliant upon local prosecutors, police officials, or press reports to identify cases and patterns that may require immediate federal investigation and prosecution. Protect prison inmates from abuse Many men and women incarcerated in the nation's jails and prisons are subjected to violence, injury and sexual abuse at the hands of either other inmates or correctional officers. Your Department should use its authority to protect the rights of inmates to safe and humane conditions of incarceration. With this in view, we urge you to provide increased personnel and other resources to the Department's Civil Rights Division to enable it both to undertake more civil and criminal investigations into abusive correctional facilities, and to initiate the appropriate civil or criminal proceedings. In addition, we urge you to institute within the federal Bureau of Prisons - and to encourage state correctional systems to institute - effective, independent mechanisms to receive and investigate complaints of abuse from inmates, to provide the inmates with appropriate redress, and to hold accountable abusive correctional officers. We also urge a complete investigation into the recent history of beatings of inmates at USP Florence by federal officers who termed themselves the """"Cowboys."""" In particular, such an investigation should establish how and why it was possible for the abuses to continue for as long as they did and on so large a scale, and identify the changes needed in Bureau of Prisons' policies and procedures to prevent any possibility of repetition. One of the most serious abuses plaguing our nation's prisons and jails is prisoner-on-prisoner rape. Such rapes, frequently, are unimaginably vicious and brutal, and their effects on the victim's psyche, let alone health, can be deep and enduring. Yet, despite the widespread and persistent nature of the problem, few states take specific affirmative steps to prevent or punish this gross abuse against persons in their custody. This is an issue on which we urge you to take a clear lead. In particular, we urge you to instruct the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division to be extremely attentive to this issue when conducting its investigations into conditions of state correctional facilities. We also request that you instruct the National Institute of Corrections to develop, and widely promote, specific protocols for the prevention and investigation of prisoner-on-prisoner rape. Improve conditions in the Bureau of Prisons' super-maximum security prison While we recognize that dangerous and violent inmates pose particular custodial problems, we are greatly concerned that the Administrative Maximum Security facility (ADX) in Florence, Colorado is operated in ways that violate basic human rights. In particular, policies in effect there permit inmates to be subjected to years of confinement in conditions of extreme social isolation, reduced sensory stimulation, and rigorous security control, regardless of whether such confinement is instituted as punishment for misconduct or as the result of administrative management classification decisions. Prolonged confinement under such conditions can constitute cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment as prohibited by human rights treaties to which the U.S. is party. We urge you to undertake without delay a high-level review of these policies, with a view to bringing them into full conformity with recognized international human rights standards relating to the treatment of prisoners. We urge you also to evaluate the Bureau's mechanisms for ensuring fairness and accountability in ADX placement decisions. Our research indicates that the Bureau does not provide inmates with detailed justifications for why they are being sent to or kept at ADX, and that it takes insufficient precautions to protect inmates from being consigned, through unnecessary or arbitrary decisions, to the extreme strictures of ADX confinement. The Department should also encourage states to institute comparable reviews of their own policies and procedures regarding the criteria for sending inmates to, and retaining them at, super-maximum security facilities, and the conditions in those facilities. Address abuses of children in detention In many juvenile detention facilities across the country, children are detained in overcrowded and unsafe conditions; receive inadequate educational, medical and mental health services; endure physical abuse by staff; and are subject to excessive use of disciplinary measures, including use of isolation and physical restraints. Increasing numbers of youth are also being tried as adults and detained in adult jails, depriving youth of the variety of rehabilitative dispositions that are available in juvenile proceedings. Moreover, as academic studies have shown, adult inmates disproportionately target juveniles held in adult facilities for sexual abuse. We urge you to instruct the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to develop mandatory standards for the administration of juvenile justice that, at a minimum, comply with international standards on the conditions of confinement of children and are applicable to all public and private facilities, including adult detention and correctional centers. We also urge continued investigations by the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division into conditions of confinement for children held in juvenile detention facilities as well as adult jails and prisons. End overly harsh sentences for nonviolent drug offenders We urge you to commit the Department to endorse the sensible, just, and parsimonious use of prison as a sanction of last resort, and to lend your authority to efforts to reduce the overincarceration of Americans that has given the U.S. the highest rate of incarceration in the world after post-genocide Rwanda. Almost seven hundred thousand Americans are currently held in state or federal prison for nonviolent crimes, three hundred thousand on drug charges. Indeed, 60 percent of federal inmates were sentenced for nonviolent drug offenses, and high proportions are merely low-level offenders, not major traffickers or """"king pins."""" The public's interest in securing accountability, promoting public safety and curbing the drug trade can be served without the imposition of unnecessarily harsh prison sentences for drug offenders, and without mandatory minimum criminal sentencing laws that tie judges' hands in sentencing. You should press for the elimination of harsh mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders in federal law and limit federal prosecutions to major traffickers. We also urge you to encourage states - including with funding and technical assistance - to give greater emphasis to substance abuse treatment and alternatives to incarceration for nonviolent drug offenders. Address the discriminatory impact of the national war on drugs The nation's war on drugs, however laudable its objectives, has been pursued with methods that have disproportionately and unfairly targeted black Americans. Blacks are arrested, prosecuted and incarcerated on drug charges at rates that greatly exceed their rate of drug offending. In some states, blacks constitute between 80 and 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison. In at least fifteen states, black men are admitted to prison on drug charges at rates that are from 20 to 57 times greater than those of white men. Some 45 percent of federal inmates sentenced on drug charges are black. Federal mandatory minimum sentencing laws that establish a 100-to-1 crack-cocaine-to-powder-cocaine quantity ratio for sentencing purposes are a primary cause of the longer sentences black federal drug defendants receive compared to white defendants. We urge you to direct the Department of Justice to ensure that principles of justice and equal protection of the law are the bedrock of state and federal anti-drug efforts. You should subject federal and state anti-drug laws and practices to careful scrutiny and urge change in those that cause significant, unwarranted racial disparities. At a minimum, we urge you to support elimination of the 100-1 crack-cocaine ratio in federal law, as the United States Sentencing Commission has recommended. Support data collection The Justice Department needs sufficient data and facts to create and implement responsive and effective policies. Yet the Justice Department does not compile or have access to accurate data regarding racial profiling or the use of excessive force by law enforcement officials. In the case of racial profiling by the police, we appreciate the Bush administration's support for passage of racial profiling legislation that has languished in Congress for years. The bill, sponsored by Rep. John Conyers, would require your office to conduct a study of traffic stops to better understand the extent of this practice. The bill would authorize the Justice Department to provide funding to assist law enforcement agencies in collecting those data. We urge you to support legislation as a first step in addressing this long-standing and divisive issue and to work with members of Congress to begin to remedy discriminatory practices by law enforcement officials. Nearly seven years ago, Congress instructed the Attorney General, as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, to collect data on excessive force by police and to publish an annual report from those data (42 U.S.C. §14142). No such report has been produced. At this time, the Justice Department is unable to say whether the problem of excessive force is getting worse or better, whether certain types of abuses are increasing or decreasing, or whether trends suggest effective approaches to address abuse problems. We call on the Justice Department to refocus its efforts, reallocate its research grants, and produce a report responsive to its mandate on this issue. Without the information requested by Congress, and more, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for officials at any level to craft enlightened policies that balance the importance of public order with the absolute requirement that the state protect anyone in its jurisdiction from human rights abuses at the hands of police officers. Support a moratorium on the death penalty There is widespread recognition, both domestically and internationally, that capital trials and post-conviction proceedings in the U.S. are marked by arbitrariness, racial discrimination, prosecutorial misconduct, inadequate legal representation, and the risk of error and of imposing death sentences on the innocent. Even supporters of the death penalty are deeply troubled - and rightly so - by these and many other flaws in the process by which capital punishment is imposed. The Department of Justice is currently studying the federal capital process; interim results from the study suggest the federal proceedings, like state proceedings, are marked by striking racial and geographic disparities that contradict principles of fairness and equal protection of the law. We urge you, therefore, to ensure that no federal defendants are executed until the report is completed and needed reforms have been implemented to address the deficiencies in the federal process. We urge you also to take all possible steps to ensure that states meet their constitutional and international human rights obligations to refrain from applying the death penalty in an arbitrary, unjust or discriminatory manner. At a minimum, you should encourage and support efforts to provide independent capital defendants with skilled, committed and adequately funded legal counsel for trial as well as at all post-conviction proceedings. In addition, we urge you to take steps to oppose the execution of juvenile offenders or persons who have mental retardation or are otherwise mentally impaired - executions that are prohibited under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). We also urge you to act to remove the reservations attached by the U.S. when it ratified the ICCPR, in an attempt to exempt the U.S. from the explicit objective of the relevant portion of the treaty to ban these practices. Protect the rights of immigrants and asylum seekers held in administrative detention Poor planning and new laws requiring detention for broader categories of immigrants and asylum seekers have created a detention crisis, forcing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to enter into contracts with local jails and prisons across the country to obtain adequate bed-space for its detainees. Thousands of detainees awaiting INS determinations who are not accused of any crime, or who have already served any criminal sentences, are held indefinitely in INS detention centers, county jails, and other secure facilities, in violation of international law. In January, the INS for the first time issued standards addressing conditions and treatment at all facilities where INS detainees are held. This is a positive development, but the real challenge remains adequate monitoring that leads to prompt improvements when violations of the standards are identified. With regard to asylum seekers - that is, persons seeking to establish that they are refugees fleeing persecution - we urge the administration to adhere to international standards by prohibiting the use of detention barring exceptional circumstances. In those exceptional cases in which asylum seekers are detained, that detention should be for the shortest time necessary. Alternative, non-custodial monitoring mechanisms (with reporting requirements) should be employed as a matter of first course. Detention should be considered only on a case-by-case basis after a thorough review of an individual asylum seeker's circumstances. Asylum seekers should never be held in prisons or jails because the conditions and treatment in such facilities, including commingling with accused or convicted criminals, are entirely inappropriate. We also urge the INS to conduct consistent, fair, and unbiased reviews to consider release for indefinite detainees who cannot be deported to their countries of origin. In addition, the INS should enforce detention standards and ensure access to effective legal representation. The INS detains over 5,800 children every year. Nearly 2,000 are held in juvenile detention centers or other secure settings, even though most have never been charged with any crime. Some are subjected to harsh, punitive conditions and, contrary to the Flores settlement, may be commingled with juveniles charged or adjudicated delinquent. Unaccompanied children should be placed in the least restrictive setting appropriate to the child's age and special needs, and secure detention should be used only in very exceptional circumstances, for example, if a thorough and individualized investigation reveals no possible safe alternatives. We urge you to press the INS to develop alternatives to detention for unaccompanied minors, and to order INS officers to immediately cease placing unaccompanied children in state juvenile justice facilities, or in other facilities with prison-like conditions. Address U.S. Border Patrol abuses Over the last decade, Human Rights Watch has published several reports documenting abuses committed by the U.S. Border Patrol, including beatings and sexual assaults. There have also been several cases of border-crossers being shot by agents, with the agents often claiming later that the border-crosser was throwing, or reaching for, a rock. Despite a clear pattern of alleged rock-throwing by border-crossers leading to agents' use of lethal force, the INS fails to require that the agents wear appropriate protective gear to minimize possible injuries to agents and the consequent rationale for use of lethal force by the agents. Human Rights Watch has also documented how the U.S. government often fails to investigate and punish abuses by U.S. border agents. The dramatic growth in the size of the Border Patrol in recent years has only exacerbated the problem of effective oversight. Officials from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have complained of severe understaffing that limits their ability to investigate the complaints they receive of border abuses. We urge you to ensure that, in the rush to recruit and deploy additional agents, applicants are properly screened, recruits are properly trained and supervised, and those promoted to supervise the influx of new agents are appropriately chosen and sufficiently trained to supervise the new agents. Agents patrolling areas where rock-throwing is said to be common should wear protective gear. We also urge you to increase the budget of the OIG so that its investigators are able to investigate fully and promptly all complaints that fall under the office's mandate. Ratify and implement international human rights treaties It is increasingly difficult for the United States to speak out on human rights issues internationally because of the United States' dismal record in ratifying human rights treaties. When it does ratify rights treaties, the U.S has typically carved away any new protections for those in the United States by adding reservations, declarations, and understandings - on such issues as stopping the execution of juvenile offenders or providing protection from invidious discriminatory treatment. Moreover, the United States is behind the rest of the developed world in ratifying the key international instruments on women's rights, economic rights, and workers' rights, and it stands alone with Somalia among all the countries in the world in failing to ratify the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Ironically, in light of its long stated commitment to upholding human rights at home and in its foreign policy, the U.S. government today poses a threat to the universality of human rights. We can expect that efforts to exempt the United States from the international system for protecting human rights will be mimicked by unsavory governments and other international actors. Moreover, the U.S. government's unwillingness to subject itself to international human rights standards risks diminishing what should be one of the most important voices defending human rights. We urge you to support the ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We also urge you to continue, and enhance, the Interagency Working Group on Human Rights Treaties, created in December 1998. Among its tasks, the IWG was to institute training and guidance for local and state governments so that they honor U.S. human rights obligations; to review reservations, declarations, and understandings that the U.S. has attached to ratified treaties; to review proposed legislation to ensure that it is in conformity with human rights obligations; to facilitate the production of treaty compliance reports; and to promote the ratification of human rights treaties. Since the IWG's mandate covers domestic human rights issues in the United States, we believe it should be housed, and chaired by, the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department, rather than by the National Security Council, since the latter has little expertise on these matters. In all of the areas noted above, the Department has a unique mandate to protect basic human rights here in the United States. We urge you, as Attorney General, to act boldly and forcefully to demonstrate to the country - and the world - that the U.S. government champions human rights at home as well as abroad, and that it will not tolerate abuses of those rights for any reason. We look forward to an opportunity to discuss this human rights agenda with you at your earliest convenience. Sincerely, Kenneth Roth Executive Director","United States",""

The International monitoring group also pressed for swift progress on eliminating sex discrimination from the country's laws. The personal status code, part of Morocco's civil law, establishes a system of inequality based on sex, and relegates women to a subordinate status in society. The code stipulates that the family is under the direction of the husband, and that the wife's main marital duty is to obey her husband in all matters. """"Reforming the personal status code is a true test for Morocco's progress on human rights,"""" said Regan E. Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Yousoufi government should finish what it started when it presented its reforms to the code two years ago.""""  King Mohammed VI met on March 5, 2001, with women representatives of political and women's rights organizations, and announced the formation of the royal commission. Morocco last modified its personal status code in 1993, but numerous provisions still discriminate against women.  In March 1999, in an effort to address discrimination against women, Prime Minister Abderrahmane El-Yousoufi presented a National Plan for the Integration of Women in Development. The plan's section on reforming the personal status code would, among other things, raise the minimum age of marriage for girls and women from fifteen to eighteen; outlaw polygamy except in certain cases; give women the right to half of the property acquired during the marriage after a divorce; and allow divorced mothers to retain custody of their children if they remarry.   The plan, especially the section on reforming the personal status code, has faced fierce opposition from conservative and Islamist groups. In March 2000, two large demonstrations, one supporting the plan and one opposing it, were organized in Rabat and Casablanca.   In May 2000, and in response to the intense public debate on women's rights, the prime minister appointed a committee of twenty religious scholars, sociologists, judges, and one women's rights activist, to look into the controversial aspects of the plan and make their recommendations to the King. The committee has never met, and as a result the implementation of the plan has been put on hold.   """"Women's rights to equality in law and practice should not be compromised,"""" added Ralph. """"The new royal commission should reflect the growing voices for reform, and should include representatives of women's rights organizations.""""   Backgrounder  In 1998, the late King Hassan II asked El-Yousoufi to form a coalition government. El-Yousoufi is the first opposition figure to become prime minister in modern Moroccan history. Hopes were high that the Yousoufi government would make progress on human rights, and address thorny issues such as impunity for previous abuses and women's rights. When King Mohammed VI acceded to the throne in 1999, hopes were also raised that a new era of reform was about to begin in Morocco. The new king has stated on more than one occasion his support for human rights and his belief that protecting human rights is consistent with Islam, Morocco's official religion.   In 1992, Moroccan women's rights activists initiated a one million-signature campaign to reform the personal status code. Their campaign resulted in minimal reforms in 1993. These reforms required the consent and signature of the intended wife to the marriage contract; allowed women over the age of eighteen whose fathers are deceased to contract their marriage without a guardian's permission; allowed a woman to include a clause in the marriage contract reserving her right to ask for a divorce if her husband marries additional wives; and granted women whose husbands are deceased or incapacitated the legal custody of their children.   Since 1993, women's rights organizations have established various centers for legal and psychological counseling for women, and conducted public awareness campaigns on discrimination and violence against women. In 1998, the Yousoufi government conducted a public awareness campaign on violence against women, and then, in consultation with women's rights organizations, introduced the Plan for the Integration of Women in Development. The plan focuses on illiteracy, reproductive health, economic development, and women's legal, political, and institutional development.   Given widespread recognition of the need to improve women's rights as a part of improving Morocco's overall human rights record, women's rights activists have expressed their expectations that the National Plan for the Integration of Women in Development-which represents at best their minimum demands-could and should be implemented.   Morocco's current personal status code (PSC) establishes the legal framework for men's ability to assert authority and control over women within the context of the family. It also creates different standards and rights for women and men when entering marriage. Moroccan women's inequality in marriage begins before their unions are finalized. For example, while men over the age of eighteen are not required to seek authorization to marry, women of any age must obtain the authorization of a male guardian in contracting marriage. Only in narrow circumstances are women legally authorized to represent themselves in contracting their marriage.  Moroccan law further discriminates against women by allowing men to have up to four wives simultaneously. The 1993 law reforms require the disclosure of polygamy to the first and subsequent wives, and subject polygamy to the discretion of the judge. However, evidence gathered by Human Rights Watch indicates that these reforms were ineffective since they fail to spell out the specific procedures to ensure their enforcement.   Under prevailing Moroccan personal status laws, the husband enjoys a unilateral and unconditional right to divorce (repudiate) his wife. Men are granted sole right to repudiation, and the right to revoke the repudiation at will within three months. A husband can exercise repudiation three times and revoke it two times. Our research indicates that the ease with which men can revoke their repudiation creates legal, emotional, and mental hardships for women. The PSC requires the repudiation to take place in the presence of the wife and with a judge's authorization. If a wife is summoned to court and does not attend, and her husband insists on the repudiation, her  presence is immaterial.   Women, in contrast, have much more limited ability to initiate divorce. Unlike men, women cannot divorce their husbands without specific grounds or a court proceeding. A woman can offer financial compensation in exchange for repudiation (khul'), or sue for a judicial divorce. Husbands, however, can effectively restrict a woman's access to divorce by refusing to accept compensation to terminate the marriage. Even when a husband agrees to divorce, many women consider khul' to be an undesirable option since it often requires them to relinquish future financial support and property to which they otherwise would be entitled.   A wife's only other access to divorce is to initiate a judicial divorce on one of five grounds: her husband's lack of financial support; his unjustifiable prolonged absence; his suffering from an incurable disease or defect; his abstinence from sexual relations for more than four months; or his doing her harm. Domestic violence does not constitute separate grounds for divorce under Moroccan penal law, but is, if proven, considered to constitute harm. The burden of proof is on the woman, and the standard of proof applied in many divorce cases involving domestic violence is exceptionally high. Judges usually demand medical certificates testifying to grave assault, as well as documentation of the initiation or completion of police and criminal proceedings. Our research found that the high standard of proof discourages women victims of domestic violence from suing for divorce.   One serious consequence of such systematic, routine discrimination against women is to render them vulnerable to violence. Furthermore, the barriers to judicial divorce  on the grounds of harm convey to men an implicit but powerful message of social tolerance for a certain degree of domestic violence. Unless divorce is preceded by reconciliation attempts and there is a history of abuse proven by medical as well as police or court documentation, a woman's ability to escape an abusive husband by way of judicial divorce is severely restricted. Therefore, by failing to recognize physical acts of discipline as abusive, and by denying women adequate legal recourse to remedy such violence, the Moroccan legal system allows husbands to abuse their wives with impunity.","Middle East/North Africa, Morocco/Western Sahara","Women's Rights"

On March 27, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in the constitutional appeal of Johnny Paul Penry, who has the mental skills of a six-and-a-half year old. The court stayed his execution date of November 16, 2000, pending a ruling on his appeal. In the last four weeks, the court has also stayed the executions of two other mentally retarded offenders who are challenging the constitutionality of their death sentences. """"Executing adults with the minds of children is nothing short of barbaric,"""" said Jamie Fellner, Human Rights Watch Associate Counsel and an author of the fifty-page report, Beyond Reason: The Death Penalty and Offenders with Mental Retardation. """"Polls show most supporters of the death penalty agree. It is time for legislators to outlaw this senseless cruelty."""" The United States appears to be the only democracy whose laws expressly permit the execution of persons with this severe mental disability. At least thirty-five mentally retarded people have been executed in the United States since 1976. An estimated two to three hundred currently await execution on death row. Legislation to prohibit the death penalty for the mentally retarded is currently under consideration in a number of states, including Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Texas. In 1989, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the execution of persons with mental retardation was not unconstitutional. The court concluded there was no national consensus against such executions because only two states prohibited them. Since then, the number of states that legislatively exempt mentally retarded persons from the death penalty has grown to thirteen, in addition to the federal government. Beyond Reason provides numerous examples of persons who have been sentenced to death despite the profound intellectual limitations they have suffered since birth: · When Johnny Paul Penry was convicted of murder in Texas, he had an I.Q. that had been measured on different tests between 50 and the low sixties (100 is the average), he could not read or write, name the days of the week or months of the year, or name the president of the United States. · After Doil Lane confessed to murdering a young girl, he climbed into the lap of the police officer who was questioning him. He asked the judge for crayons so he could color pictures during his trial. · Jerome Holloway, convicted of murder in Georgia, had an I.Q. of 49 and could not tell the time, recite the alphabet, or identify the country he lived in. · Limmie Arthur, convicted of murder in South Carolina, was asked to recite the alphabet by a psychologist evaluating him. He began to sing the nursery rhyme of the ABCs, but could only get half way through. Offenders with mental retardation are particularly vulnerable to the well-documented arbitrariness and high risk of error in U.S. capital trials, according to Human Rights Watch. Beyond Reason documents how mentally retarded people are incapable of understanding - much less protecting - their constitutional rights; how their characteristic suggestibility and willingness to please leads them to confess - even falsely - to capital crimes; and how they are unable to understand the legal proceedings against them and assist in their own defense. · Eddie Mitchell, on death row in Louisiana, waived his right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during his police interrogation. Later, when asked by his lawyer if he understood what it meant to waive his rights, Mitchell simply waved his hand. · Before his execution, Morris Mason asked for advice on what to wear to his funeral. · Earl Washington confessed to a crime he did not commit after a long police interrogation. The courts held he had """"knowingly"""" waived his right against self-incrimination even though Washington's mental capacity was that of a ten-year-old. · Robert Wayne Sawyer, asked to explain the concept of """"reasonable doubt,"""" pointed to the smoke from a crushed cigarette and said that when the smoke stopped """"it's reasonable out.""""","United States, Criminal Justice, Economic Justice, Racial Justice","Children's Rights, Youth Justice"

Rights violations in China, including labor rights abuses, are likely to be the subject of renewed international attention at the annual meetings of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, scheduled to open March 19 in Geneva. Just two weeks ago, on February 28, 2001, China ratified the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a major human rights treaty, but Beijing has indicated that key labor rights provisions in the treaty would be excluded. Li Jiaqing, a worker in Henan province, is currently awaiting a verdict on charges of """"gathering a crowd to disrupt social order,"""" a crime punishable with imprisonment of three to seven years under Article 290 (1) of the Chinese Criminal Code. He was tried for his role in a labor protest that led to the occupation of a state-run paper mill in June 2000. """"China says it respects economic rights, but the vulnerability of its workers is actually increasing, particularly in state-run enterprises,"""" said Jan van der Made, Hong Kong-based China researcher at Human Rights Watch. """"They're caught in a squeeze, facing massive plant closures and layoffs. Workers lack the basic means to protest, such as the right to organize and collectively express their grievances."""" While Human Rights Watch recognizes that the Chinese government may legitimately enforce laws against protesters who unlawfully occupy factory premises, it believes that the Li Jiaqing case involves broader issues of freedom of association and the protection of worker rights. The Chinese government prosecuted Li Jiaqing partly on the basis that he had attempted to organize a """"workers' congress,"""" even though such congresses are expressly allowed for under Chinese law governing state-run enterprises. The Zhengzhou Paper Mill where Li worked is a state-owned factory. It stopped production in 1995 and was idle for two years until it merged with a local enterprise, the Fenghua company. At the time of the merger, Fenghua promised to pay the mill workers' basic living expenses but instead, according to workers, started to siphon off the assets of the old paper factory. On October 28, 1999, Li Jiaqing organized a workers' congress at the mill. Although Chinese law prohibits free trade unions, it does allow, on paper, site-specific """"staff and workers' representative congresses"""" at state-run enterprises. Chapter 5, Article 51 of the 1988 State-Owned Enterprise Law and Article 30 of the 1992 Trade Union Law state that """"The workers' representative congress is the basic form of enterprise democratic management.""""  In the Zhengzhou Paper Mill case, the workers' congress first democratically elected a slate of leaders. The leaders, including Li Jiaqing, then issued a proclamation seeking to nullify the merger and protect workers' basic rights. In January 2000, the workers circulated an eight-point petition to the City Government and the Bureau of Light Industry demanding safeguards for their factories' assets. After the petition met with no response, more than a hundred workers occupied the factory starting in June 2000 to protest the merger. On August 7, police came to Li Jiaqing's house and detained him as the suspected ringleader. The next day, some 500 public security personnel and armed police forced their way into the factory and detained twenty workers. All were released after a day's questioning except for Li Guangquan, a fifty-two-year old worker. Li Guangquan was charged with """"obstructing traffic"""" and imprisoned for four months. He was released in January. Li Jiaqing has remained behind bars since August 7. Li Jiaqing's trial was held at the Zhengzhou Municipal Court on February 13, 2001 as some 200 workers protested outside the courthouse demanding his release. His wife was allowed to be present at the trial, and it was the first time since police detained him that she had been able to see him. The trial was adjourned and Li Jiaqing remains in the Zhengzhou No. 2 Detention Center awaiting the verdict. Two weeks after the trial, on February 28, 2001, China ratified the International Convention on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Authorities have since indicated that they will not give full effect to workers' rights protections included in the treaty, including provisions in Article 8 of the treaty guaranteeing workers' rights to form and join unions of their choosing, and will continue to apply existing Chinese labor law. Under existing law, independent labor unions are outlawed and all workers seeking to organize must affiliate with a state-controlled labor federation. Human Rights Watch has called upon the Chinese government to ratify the core conventions of the International Labor Organization without delay. China is a member of the ILO, which has a representative in Beijing. But to date, it has not ratified the Convention on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organize, and the Convention on the Right to Organize and Collective Bargaining. As a member of the ILO, China is obliged to respect the right of free association even if it has not ratified the relevant convention.","Asia, China and Tibet","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Gabriel Nikundana, also of Radio Bonesha, was detained on March 12 and held for forty-eight hours before being charged with a """"press offense.""""  Last week the two journalists aired an interview with Anicet Ntawuhiganayo, a spokesman for the rebel group, the Forces Nationales pour la Libération (FNL). Journalists from other stations who broadcast similar programs or who are known to be in touch with rebel groups have also been threatened with arrest by authorities this week.  Burundi has been involved in a seven-year long civil war that pits rebel groups of the majority Hutu group against a government and army dominated by the minority Tutsi group. In early February the FNL attacked the capital of Bujumbura and held an outlying portion of the city for nearly two weeks before being repelled.  According to government figures, some two hundred combatants and soldiers died in the fighting. Unlike many previous military operations in Burundi, neither side has been charged with widespread killing of civilians in this attack.  A peace accord between the government and opposition political groups was signed in August 2000 but did not include the two major rebel groups, the FNL and the Forces pour la Défense de la Démocratie (FDD). Recently the government of Burundi has reportedly been engaged in secret talks with one or both groups.  """"Private radio stations play an important role in providing unbiased reporting to Burundians,"""" said Takirambudde.

On March 15, the Kampot provincial court found commune chief Im Nan, a member of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, guilty of the premeditated murder of Pak Choeun and his wife Doung Meas on June 3, 2000, and sentenced him to seventeen years in prison. An associate of Im Nan, Rith Kha, was also found guilty and sentenced to seventeen years. Two other accomplices, Kem Ham and Svay Ran, were sentenced in absentia to fifteen and twelve years respectively. During the past year, numerous incidents of violence have taken place against local opposition leaders, mostly directed at members of the opposition Sam Rainsy Party (SRP). In this case, the victim, Pak Choeun, 57, was an active member of the royalist Funcinpec party who had planned to run in commune elections scheduled for 2002. """"Without recognition of the political underpinnings of the crime, the deterrent impact of Im Nan's conviction is going to be lost,"""" said Sidney Jones, executive director for Asia at Human Rights Watch. """"Official impunity for criminal acts will only end when the full facts of cases like this one are publicly aired."""" During the trial, Prosecutor Uk Kim Sith attributed the murders to an act of retaliation for the alleged use of """"black magic."""" The political dimension, including allegations that Im Nan had earlier threatened to kill anyone who dared to run against him, were not examined in depth. Pak Choeun was a well-known and respected figure in Laboeuk commune in Kampot province. Shortly before his death, Choeun was nominated by the Funcinpec party to run on a slate for commune chief. One Funcinpec member interviewed by rights workers-who did not testify at the trial-said that a month before his death, Choeun had asked him to tell all party members to keep a low profile and take precautions, because the commune chief had vowed to kill anyone who challenged him in the commune election. Choeun and his wife were gunned down while they were sleeping in a shelter in their ricefield in Laboeuk. On August 17, police arrested Im Nan, who confessed to plotting the murder because of alleged """"black magic"""" activities by Choeun. Rith Kha was arrested the same day, after Im Nan stated that he had promised to pay Rith Kha 200,000 riel (about U.S. $50) to carry out the murder. During the one-day trial on March 12, a soldier and a police officer testified that, about a month before the murders, Im Nan hired them to kill Choeun and lent them weapons because of Choeun's black magic activities. They said that they had waited to ambush Choeun in the ricefield but he had not come by at the appropriate moment. In addition, the chief of the commune intervention police and Im Nan's brother-who is a member of the commune militia-both testified that Im Nan had asked them to kill Choeun several times over the last few years, but refused. The commune policeman testified that, prior to the murder, one of his subordinates told him that Im Nan had asked him to kill Choeun. The policeman advised his subordinate not to carry out the killing and then warned the family that Im Nan wanted to kill Choeun. """"It's clear that Pak Choeun's murder was motivated in part by local political rivalries, in addition to a long-standing personal dispute with the commune chief,"""" said Sidney Jones. """"The message, however, is clear: involvement in politics can be life threatening."""" Other attacks against local leaders in recent months include the slaying on February 10, 2000, of SRP member Chim Chuon in Kompong Cham for which a commune militiaman was later arrested, and the August 17, 2000, murder of Khhim Nhak, an SRP commune council member in Kompong Cham, for which the commune's deputy police chief was subsequently arrested. Other SRP commune candidates in Kompong Cham, Kampot and Prey Veng have also been threatened or attacked during the last twelve months. Commune elections are scheduled for February 2002 in Cambodia's 1600 communes. Presently nearly all commune chiefs are people who have been appointed by the Cambodian People's Party.","Asia, Cambodia",""

Introduction Human Rights Watch welcomes this opportunity to submit information to the Human Rights Committee regarding Venezuela's implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We wish to draw the Committee's attention to certain deficiencies in Venezuela's application of the Covenant, based on our monitoring of human rights conditions in that country over the past several years, including through a research visit to the country in January 2001. In considering Venezuela's third periodic report on the implementation of the Covenant, the Committee should note that Venezuela's new Constitution came into force in December 1999, some seventeen months after the government's report was written. The new Constitution has important implications for the protection of human rights. For this reason we have divided this memorandum into two parts. The first part deals with those human rights issues that have been of long-standing concern to Human Rights Watch, relating to the Covenant's Article 6 (right to life), Article 7 (torture), and Article 10 (prison conditions). These problems are also addressed in Venezuela's report to the Committee. The second part deals specifically with problem areas in the new Constitution or in its application. These relate primarily to the Covenant's Article 14 (fair trial), Article 22 (freedom of association), Article 19 (freedom of expression), and Article 25 (political rights). II. Long-standing concerns relating to violations of Articles 6, 7, and 10: Extrajudicial executions, torture, and inhumane prison conditions The most serious human rights violations in Venezuela arise in the context of the country's extremely high crime rate. Last year, levels of criminal violence increased notably (upwards of 9,000 homicides in 2000, with 241 occurring during the three-day Christmas break in December). The failure of the criminal justice system to adequately address the problem has been accompanied by a spiraling breakdown in public respect for the law, and mob lynchings have become increasingly common (eleven cases were reported during the first week of January 2001). Over the last decade, gross abuses by the police, including extrajudicial executions, the excessive use of lethal force, arbitrary arrests, and torture, have become pervasive and common. 1. Violations of Article 6 (the right to life) Each year scores of criminal suspects are shot and killed during police raids on poor urban neighborhoods, in circumstances indicating that they were victims of extrajudicial executions or excessive use of force. Last year, Venezuelan human rights groups recorded 116 alleged extrajudicial executions by (in order of numbers recorded) Caracas' Metropolitan Police, the Technical Branch of the Judicial Police, state police forces in the states of Zulia, Anzoátegui, Carabobo, Aragua, Miranda, Bolívar, and the National Guard. This was the second highest annual total recorded since 1988, and was significantly above the average recorded during the last decade. The Venezuelan government acknowledges in its report both that such abuses occur and that they are of the utmost gravity. Yet, both the police and the courts continue to fail to ensure that such incidents are properly investigated and that those officers responsible for committing extrajudicial executions or other serious abuses are brought to justice and/or disciplined. The information provided by the government (para. 63 of the third periodic report) is vague and lacks specificity regarding convictions of police officers responsible for such unlawful deaths. We fear, in fact, that police officers can commit abuses with virtual impunity and that this contributes to a pervasive culture and climate of official abuse. We are particularly concerned that, despite the elimination of the much-criticized pretrial inquiry known as """"nudo hecho"""" (which had to be completed before a criminal investigation of abuses by public officials could even begin), there has been no improvement in the speed or effectiveness of official investigations into police abuses. The Support Group for Justice and Peace, a Venezuelan human rights group that assists relatives of victims of extrajudicial executions in pursuing justice in the courts, followed thirty such cases over the past year. It reports that the prosecutor responsible for the cases has yet to decide whether or not to prosecute three cases that were identified more than one year ago. The same organization reported that four police officers were convicted of committing human rights abuses last year, but all their cases had been in the courts for five years or more. The introduction of the new Organic Code of Criminal Procedure (COPP), in July 1999, does not appear to have improved the speed or efficiency of official investigations in such cases. The whereabouts or fate of four persons detained by the Parachute Regiment and the political police, known as the DISIP, during combined military and police operations in the state of Vargas in December 1999 remain unknown. The Ombudsman reported that there were sixty extrajudicial executions of suspected looters and criminals that month, a time when there was serious flooding in the province. The four who """"disappeared"""" - Marco Antonio Monasterio Pérez, Oscar José Blanco Romero, José Francisco Rivas Fernández and Roberto Javier Hernández Paz - were detained during this period but have not been seen since. The courts have rejected habeas corpus writs lodged on behalf of the four, though they have confirmed the arrests of Monasterio and Blanco, who were detained on December 21 by the Parachute Regiment and handed over on the same day to the DISIP. DISIP, however, said it had no record of having received them. 2. Violations of Article 7 (the right to be free from torture, or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment) Cases of torture and ill-treatment of criminal suspects in police or military custody continue to occur, although the incidence has declined since the mid-1990s. Venezuelan nongovernmental human rights organizations reported a further, welcome reduction in the number of reported cases of torture in the period from October 1999 to September 2000. The COPP, which reduces the frequency and duration of pretrial detention, and invalidates extrajudicial confessions as trial evidence, therefore appears to have had a positive impact in reducing torture and ill-treatment of detainees. The reforms introduced in the COPP are a praiseworthy response to recommendations made by, among others, the Special Rapporteur on Torture in his 1996 report on Venezuela. Yet, although torture is prohibited in the new Venezuelan Constitution, it is not yet specifically included as a crime in the current Criminal Code. The Special Rapporteur has recommended that legislation be passed to remedy this deficiency. Venezuela's report makes reference to such legislation (para. 94 of the state's report), stating that a proposal will be sent to the legislature in 1998. The Fourth Transitory Provision of the 1999 Constitution states that the National Assembly will approve new legislation on torture and its eradication within a year of the installation of the National Assembly. So far, however, although drafts are under discussion in committee, a formal proposal to criminalize torture has yet to be presented to the National Assembly, which completes its first year of sessions in August 2001. 3. Violations of Article 10 (humane treatment of those deprived of their liberty) Although the Venezuelan authorities have long recognized that the country's prisons are wracked by anarchy, violence, and inhumane treatment (paragraphs 186-190 of the state report), it has yet to take the necessary measures to bring conditions into line with international standards. In 1997, Human Rights Watch published a major report, Punishment Before Trial: Prison Conditions in Venezuela. The serious problems described in that report, including, most notably, chronic and uncontrolled inmate-on-inmate violence, have yet to be addressed. According to the Ministry of Justice's Office of Regulation and Control of the Penitentiary System, during 1997 there were 188 deaths by stabbing, 134 deaths by gunfire, and 1,438 persons wounded by stabbing and gunfire in Venezuela's prisons. According to the Minister of the Interior and Justice (the new name of the combined ministry), during the first nine months of 1999, 298 prisoners died in violent incidents and 1,394 were seriously injured, mostly at the hands of other inmates. Between October 1999 and September 2000, 338 deaths and 1,255 serious injuries were reported in the prisons. These figures show little significant change, and are among the highest in the continent. Venezuelan inmates have easy access to guns, knives, and home-made weapons; drug-trafficking is rife, and prison staff are few. As a result, prison gangs dispute control among themselves; corruption of guards for favors and privileges is the norm; sexual abuse and killings are common, particularly of prisoners held for sexual crimes or crimes against children. Such incidents generally go unreported and unpunished. There has been a significant reduction in prison overcrowding, however, due to a reduction in the number of unsentenced inmates (who made up 70 percent of the prison population at the time of our 1997 report). During the last two years, thousands of prisoners awaiting trial have been released in accordance with the requirements of the COPP. As a result, the total prison population dropped from around 32,000 in July 1999 to some 15,160 at the end of 2000. However, pretrial detainees across the country held violent prison protests in mid-1999 when the COPP was not immediately implemented in full after its formal entry into force. In October 1999, the National Constituent Assembly, in coordination with the judicial and prison authorities, announced a """"Prison Emergency Plan"""" that speeded up the release of unconvicted prisoners. This emergency plan, however, indirectly fuelled widespread criticism of the COPP because administrative chaos resulted in the release into the community of a number of potentially dangerous criminals. Indeed, Venezuelan human rights groups are concerned that the new code of criminal procedural has become a political scapegoat for law enforcement problems that arose out of the failure to institute secure and effective mechanisms for its implementation. Worryingly, the continuing high level of crime has led to proposals to reintroduce some of the abusive practices - such as arrest on mere suspicion and prolonged pretrial detention - that the COPP was designed to eliminate.   III. Problem areas in the new Constitution and its application The Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela entered into effect on December 30, 1999, following a national referendum. Its forty-two articles on human rights include some of the most advanced in the hemisphere. For example, under Article 45, the crime of enforced """"disappearance"""" is explicitly prohibited, and any officials ordered to commit this offense are obliged to denounce their superiors to the authorities. In addition, Article 55 restricts the use of lethal force by police in accordance with the norms of necessity and proportionality; Article 68 bars the use of firearms and toxic weapons in policing demonstrations; Articles 280-283 establish a Human Rights Ombudsman; Article 23 accords human rights treaty obligations constitutional status and obliges the courts to apply them, if necessary in preference to domestic laws; and Article 31 guarantees the right to seek justice or protection from an international human rights body. Nonetheless, the Constitution has some weaknesses in human rights protection, and there remain important inconsistencies between it and existing laws. Finally, with regard to some issues, particularly those involving political rights, the government and the courts have failed to abide by its requirements. 1. Violations of Article 14 (the right to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law) Article 261 of the new Constitution states that """"the commission of common crimes, violations of human rights and crimes against humanity shall be judged by ordinary tribunals. The competence of military tribunals is limited to crimes of a military nature."""" Until the introduction of this provision, jurisdiction over the prosecution of human rights abuses committed by members of the military and the National Guard (such as prison massacres) was often assumed by military tribunals, which did not offer sufficient guarantees of independence and impartiality. By restricting the jurisdiction of military courts to crimes of a military nature, Article 261 does not, at least in peacetime, permit the trial of civilians in military courts. This new rule, however, was not readily accepted by the Venezuelan armed forces. On January 7, 2001, Pablo Aure Sánchez, a civilian and a law professor, was detained by members of military intelligence following an investigation by the Third Military Prosecutor into a letter critical of the armed forces that he published in the newspaper El Nacional. Aure was accused of defaming the armed forces, a crime codified in the Organic Code of Military Justice. The Minister of Defense insisted that the armed forces retain jurisdiction over the case, even though the Foreign Minister, the Attorney General, and the Human Rights Ombudsman all expressed the view that the case should be heard by the ordinary courts. On February 2, the Supreme Tribunal of Justice upheld this view and ordered the case transferred to a civilian court. The Aure case indicates that the military criminal code needs urgent revision to ensure that it is consistent with the new Constitution. 2. Violations of Article 22 (freedom of association and the right to form trade unions) Article 52 of the new Constitution states that """"every person shall have to right to associate for licit purposes in accordance with the law. The State is obliged to facilitate the exercise of this right."""" Yet the Constitution carves out an explicit exception to this rule that covers judges. According to the second paragraph of Article 256: """"judges may not associate amongst themselves."""" On February 23, 2000, the International Congress of the Latin American Federation of Magistrates (Federación Latinoamericana de Magistrados, FLAM) passed a motion finding that """"this deprivation of the right of association implies a denial of fundamental rights that gravely affects the rule of law in the Republic of Venezuela."""" Article 95 of the new Constitution establishes the right of workers to form trade unions without any distinction or prior authorization, and states that trade unions """"are not subject to intervention, suspension or administrative dissolution."""" The election of trade union leaders is by universal, direct and secret ballot. Those who abuse trade union positions for their own financial interest will be punished according to the law. Article 96 protects the right of collective bargaining. Despite this constitutional provision, however, the Venezuelan government held a national referendum on trade union reform on December 3, 2000. Voters were urged by the government to support the immediate suspension of the leaders of the country's main trade union confederations, and their replacement in elections to be held within 180 days, under a statute to be written by the National Electoral Council. This proposal violated, among other norms, Article 3 of the 87th Convention of the International Labor Organization, which states that the public authorities must abstain from intervention in union elections and administration. It drew protests from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and in late November 2000 ILO Secretary General Juan Somavía wrote to the National Electoral Council asking that the referendum be canceled. The government disregarded these appeals. On November 28, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court rejected a writ lodged by trade union representatives and civil rights organizations to nullify the referendum on constitutional grounds, without giving an audience to the plaintiffs. Among the provisions of the new Constitution violated by the referendum was Article 23, which gives constitutional status and precedence over domestic law to human rights treaties and conventions, and requires courts to apply them """"immediately and directly."""" 3. Violations of Article 19 (freedom of expression) Article 57 of the Constitution protects everyone's right """"to express freely their thoughts, ideas and opinions aloud, in writing or through any other form of expression, and to make use of any medium of communication or diffusion, without any censorship."""" Article 58, however, has provoked widespread concern among advocates of freedom of expression by giving every person """"the right to opportune, true and impartial information."""" This clause, if codified in legislation regulating the press, could potentially lead to censorship or legal reprisals against media, including journalists, that publish information deemed by the authorities not to be impartial, to be inopportune or untrue. Clearly, any such law would constitute a serious threat to media freedom and limit significantly the media's ability to act as a """"watchdog"""" of the public interest. Fortunately, no such steps have been taken to date. Indeed, the Venezuelan media reflect a wide range of political opinions, many of them highly critical of the government. Nevertheless, the existence of this constitutional provision remains a potential threat to press freedom and, as such, it should be repealed. III. Recommendations Human Rights Watch calls on the Committee to:  press for full and detailed information regarding all cases over the past three years in which members of the police or the National Guard are alleged to have committed extrajudicial executions or forced disappearances, including information on any investigations into such allegations, whether charges were brought, and the final results of any subsequent criminal prosecutions; urge the government to introduce effective measures to prevent extrajudicial executions, and to ensure that cases are promptly and impartially investigated and that those police or other law enforcement officials responsible for abuses are promptly brought to justice; request an update on the progress of legislation prohibiting torture and insist that the constitutional commitment to approve torture legislation during the National Assembly's first year be met; seek information from the government on recently-introduced amendments to the Organic Code of Penal Procedures (COPP), and obtain assurance that the basic rights protected in the code, especially the rights to due process and the presumption of innocence, will not be eroded by these reforms; press the government to invest more resources to improve the prison infrastructure; increase prison staff and improve staff training; and investigate exhaustively all reports of abuses, including both violence against prisoners by prison guards and inmate-on-inmate violence; request information on progress to bring the provisions of the military criminal code into line with the constitutional prohibition of the trial of civilians by military courts; urge the government to support an amendment to repeal the """"truthful information"""" clause in Article 58 of the Constitution; urge the government to support a constitutional amendment to lift the ban on judges' associations","Americas, Venezuela","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/14/chile-trails-continent-free-expression-issues","Chile Trails the Continent on Free Expression Issues","Chile Trails the Continent on Free Expression Issues","Reform of Antiquated Laws Urgently Needed","03/14/2001","(Santiago) - Chile's record on freedom of expression has improved little since the end of military rule, Human Rights Watch charged in a report released today.  Although the country has made great progress in prosecuting the abuses of the Pinochet dictatorship, the same repressive defamation laws that the military regime regularly employed against its critics are still in use.   Chile is unique among Latin American democracies in considering """"contempt of authority"""" to be a crime against state security, meriting up to five years' imprisonment. Last month, Gen. Hernán Gabrielli Rojas, the acting chief of the air force, initiated a prosecution under the notorious State Security Law, against three former political prisoners who alleged that Gabrielli participated in their torture just after the September 1973 military coup.   """"Chile trails the continent on freedom of expression,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"At this pivotal moment in Chile's history, when the truth about past atrocities is coming fully to light, it is unthinkable that these laws continue to constrain the public debate.""""     The 45-page Human Rights Watch report, Progress Stalled: Setbacks in Freedom of Expression Reform in Chile, calls on the Chilean legislature to repeal provisions of the State Security Law that criminalize speech, as well as to pass other much-needed free expression reforms. Although it has been over a decade since the end of military rule in Chile, reform legislation still languishes in Congress.     The criminal codes of eighteen Latin American countries have similar provisions criminalizing """"contempt of authority"""" (known in Spanish as """"desacato""""). Yet Chile's laws are more repressive in nature and scope, and are used more frequently, whereas in other countries the laws are rarely if ever applied.     Besides the prosecutions initiated by Gabrielli, Human Rights Watch knows of three other prosecutions for contempt of authority initiated so far this year. In 2000, journalist José Ale received a 541-day suspended sentence for an article summarizing criticisms of the career of former Supreme Court chief justice Servando Jordán. Although the Supreme Court upheld the sentence, President Ricardo Lagos pardoned Ale in July.     Justice Jordán is also behind the prosecution in April 1999 of journalist Alejandra Matus's damning expose of corruption in the Chilean judiciary, The Black Book of Chilean Justice. Invoking the State Security Law, Jordán had the book banned in Chile. Matus herself had to leave the country to avoid detention and, in a striking commentary on Chile's archaic speech restrictions, was granted political asylum in the United States.     The scandal caused in Chile by the Matus case led the government to support proposals in Congress to repeal provisions of the State Security Law that restrict freedom of expression. These amendments are part of a comprehensive press bill, which has been held up in the legislature for eight years. The bill includes other long overdue freedom of expression reforms, such as an end to judicial bans on press coverage of criminal investigations, an end to the jurisdiction of military courts over speech crimes such as """"sedition,"""" and the protection of journalists' sources.     Even though the State Security Law purports to cover crimes against national security, those in office may rely on it even to silence opponents in private legal quarrels. Human Rights Watch's report describes five state security prosecutions opened by the wealthy senator and former presidential candidate Francisco Javier Errázuriz, three of them filed in February 2001. In one case, Marcos Jaramillo, a landowner with whom Errázuriz is in a dispute over the boundaries of their respective estates, spent twelve days behind bars for """"insulting"""" the senator.     Prior censorship is another problem for which Chile stands out in Latin America. Chile still has a board of film censors that includes officers of the armed forces and the police. Human Rights Watch has found, however, that most recent instances of prior censorship are the result of court decisions, not acts of the film censorship board.     A case in point is the banning in 1997 of Martin Scorsese's film The Last Temptation of Christ, which Chilean judges found to have damaged Christ's honor and reputation, as well as that of his followers. In February 2001, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously that Chile's prohibition on the film violated the American Convention on Human Rights. The decision was expected to give extra impetus to a bill bogged down in Congress since 1997 to eliminate film censorship, which is presently mandated in Chile's constitution.     Vivanco urged the Chilean legislature, as it reconvenes for the 2001 session, to give first priority to passing a reform package.","Americas, Chile","Press Freedom, Free Speech"

Urged to Act on Chechnya","Rights Group Blasts Record of Commission members","03/13/2001","The Russian government has utterly failed to comply with the demands of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which must take action on the ongoing atrocities in Chechnya, Human Rights Watch said. The group also noted that this year's Commission has an unusually high number of abusive governments among its 53 members. The 14 new Commission members this year, elected for staggered three-year terms, include Algeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Syria and Vietnam. Human Rights Watch urged the establishment of an international commission of inquiry to investigate abuses in Chechnya.  """"Russian forces continue to commit atrocities in Chechnya,"""" said Reed Brody, Advocacy Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Last year, the Commission asked Russia to rein in its forces and bring abusers to justice. In light of Russia's total failure to comply, the Commission must act.""""  According to Human Rights Watch, Russian troops regularly engage in arbitrary arrests, unlawful detentions, torture, summary executions, disappearances, extortion, violations of medical neutrality, and the shelling of population centers. Corruption and lack of discipline and accountability among the troops remain pervasive.  Last year, the Commission called on Russia to conduct an investigation of abuses by its forces and to allow designated U.N. human rights investigators and rapporteurs to monitor human rights on the ground. But there was no follow-up when Russia spurned compliance even with those minimal demands. """"Countries that sponsored the resolution last year have an obligation to follow through this year,"""" said Brody.  Human Rights Watch also pointed out that U.N. member states are increasingly electing abusive governments to serve on the Commission, including governments that refuse visits by Commission monitors. For instance, Commission envoys on torture and extrajudicial executions have been trying in vain for several years to visit Algeria, a country that has never received a Commission rapporteur.  """"Having these governments on the Commission is like having foxes guarding the chicken coop,"""" said Brody. """"Governments eager to serve on the Commission on Human Rights must be willing to live up to the responsibilities of membership.""""  Looking at some of the Commission's new members, Human Rights Watch highlighted that:  - In Algeria, there has been no progress in locating or determining the fate of some 4,000 documented cases of Algerians who """"disappeared"""" after being abducted by the security forces since 1992. Government officials have disclosed little beyond inconsistent statistics that downplay the scope of the problem and statements that portray the """"disappeared"""" as persons who for the most part joined or were abducted by armed opposition groups.  - In the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the government and the various rebel and armed groups target civilians and are responsible for egregious abuses, including massacres, rapes and recruitment of child soldiers. Both the Kinshasa government and the rebels fighting to topple it stifle civil society, attack independent journalists and arbitrarily detain and ill-treat dissidents.  - Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi continues to undermine the promised constitutional reform that is needed to bring greater democratization to Kenya. This has left in place a deeply flawed political system with power concentrated in the presidency, insufficient checks on the executive, and a lack of accountability for government and ruling party officials.  - In Saudi Arabia, freedom of expression and association are non-existent. Institutionalized gender discrimination, harsh restrictions on the exercise of religious freedom, and the use of corporal punishment also characterize the kingdom's human rights record. Saudi Arabia has not signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and does not permit local human rights groups or allow international monitors to visit.  - In Syria, most civil and political rights are strictly limited in law and practice. There are no effective safeguards against arbitrary arrest and torture, and no one has been held accountable for hundreds of """"disappearances"""" and deaths under torture. The Kurdish minority continues to be denied basic rights, including in tens of thousands of cases the right to a nationality.  - In Vietnam, the government maintains tight control over freedom of expression and other basic rights. Authorities continue to take strong action against those who criticized the Vietnamese Communist Party and restrict access to areas affected by social unrest.  Human Rights Watch also noted that of the world's five most frequent users of the death penalty, four (China, DRC, Saudi Arabia, and the United States) are on the Commission. Only Iran is not.  The group called on the Commission to press for the establishment of an international observer mission to monitor and report publicly on continuing abuses in Gaza and the West Bank. The organization said that such a presence could itself improve security for civilians while providing the international community with the independent and credible evidence needed to determine if further protective steps are necessary.  Human Rights Watch noted that China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, should not be exempt from criticism by the Commission for its poor and deteriorating human rights record.  Human Rights Watch is an international monitoring group based in New York. It conducts investigations into human rights abuses in more than seventy countries and publishes its findings in dozens of reports every year.

The arrests were ordered by the Tehran Revolutionary Court-Branch 26 and as of this time the charges against and the whereabouts of the detainees remain unknown. Those arrested come from a variety of non-violent opposition groups who collaborate in an informal religious-nationalist alliance. The alliance had been supportive of the reform policies of President Khatami and critical of efforts to block reform by conservative clerics. They had been holding weekly meetings since 1984, at which they debated current political events. Since the 1997 election of President Khatami, they had widened participation in this forum and attendance had increased accordingly.  The meeting was held in the home of Mohammad Basteh-Negar, son-in-law of Grand Ayatollah Taleghani, a renowned critic of the Shah, and an inspirational figure for supporters of a liberal view of Islamic government in Iran.

By U.S. law, the United States cannot resume aid to the Yugoslav government until Belgrade cooperates with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, based in The Hague.   Blagoje Simic, indicted by the tribunal for persecution and ethnic cleansing of Bosnian Croats and Muslims while he was mayor of the town of Samac, arrived today in The Hague from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Before he left the Belgrade airport, Simic and his lawyer insisted the surrender was a voluntary act. A spokesperson for the political party of Yugoslav president Vojislav Kostunica also emphasized that today's surrender did not reflect a change in the government's policy to transfer indictees to the Tribunal.   Human Rights watch said that real cooperation with the tribunal must include the arrest and transfer of indictees such as Slobodan Milosevic and four others indicted for crimes against humanity in Kosovo, as well as former Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who was indicted for genocide in connection with the massacre of 7,000 Bosnian men after the fall of the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in July 1995.   To date the Kostunica government has refused to arrest other persons indicted by the Tribunal and take the necessary steps to transfer them to the custody of the Hague Tribunal.   """"Too many people indicted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity are still at large in Serbia,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Yugoslav authorities are eager to portray Simic's surrender as 'voluntary,' to avoid creating any precedent that might bind them. But that doesn't change the fact that Belgrade has a clear legal obligation to surrender indictees to the Hague Tribunal.""""   Simic had apparently been living in Yugoslavia for some time and had acquired Yugoslav citizenship.   Human Rights Watch urged the United States and European Union governments to cut off aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia if Belgrade fails to demonstrate real cooperation with the tribunal. According to U.S. law, no aid except for humanitarian assistance can be extended to the Yugoslav government after March 31 unless it cooperates with The Hague, which must include """"the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension.""""

About 45 percent of the contests had only a single candidate and more than one hundred of the 4,650 races had no candidate at all, according to Rwandan government statistics. """"This election has been flawed from the beginning, and those flaws far outweigh the few election-day irregularities that have been reported,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"Contests with a single contender are no contests at all.""""  In some sectors where more than one candidate ran, the balloting was expected to confirm choices that had been dictated by higher authorities.  The tightly-organized process continued yesterday, March 8, with a portion of those just elected joining others chosen two years ago to select a mayor and executive council for each of the country's 106 districts.  More than 90 percent of people eligible to vote were registered to do so, and large numbers did turn out at the polls. However, some voters told Human Rights Watch they had done so only because they feared fine or other punishment if they did not. An elderly woman in a rural area told Human Rights Watch she thought her ballot meant nothing, but that she understood that it was obligatory to vote. Other voters said the indirect system of voting for mayor with disproportionate weight given to the votes of officials chosen two years ago reduced the importance of their voices. Some remembered elections in the 1960s, when voters directly elected the heads of the districts, then called communes.  In some areas where officials found themselves short on candidates, they pressured citizens to present themselves. Several who were government employees told Human Rights Watch they had agreed to stand for the part-time community posts because they feared losing their jobs if they did not.  Authorities reportedly discouraged some potential candidates whom they found undesirable. One withdrew from the race after being visited by soldiers; another, after having received telephone threats of arrest. Three other would-be candidates were reportedly arrested, one in the east and two in the center of the country.  Political parties were barred from any electoral activity, but in some areas leaders of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, the dominant party in the government, made known their preference for a given candidate. Campaigning was limited to a fifteen-day period and could take place only under conditions set by the electoral commission. In some areas, candidates spoke to the public only once and very briefly. Anyone who violated the rules, such as by mentioning affiliation with a political party, was liable to stiff fines and imprisonment for three to five years.  Since 1994 the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) as well as the other parties in the multi-party government have agreed to engage in no political activities at the local level during the current period of transition to a new national government. But in fact, the RPF has been actively - sometimes aggressively - recruiting members and otherwise organizing in many communities. A high-ranking RPF official admitted enrolling many new members in advance of the elections. He told Human Rights Watch that the process of enrollment had been initiated by the new members rather than by the party itself, and that to have refused their request to join would have violated their right to political expression. Commenting on this position, Takirambudde said, """"It is unfortunate that Rwandans who might have wished to join other parties have not been allowed the same freedom.""""  In the northwestern province of Gisenyi, there were two reports of minor violence. In one place a member of the Local Defense Force, a government-organized militia, beat voters waiting in line and one woman had to be hospitalized. In other cases, members of the Local Defense Force closely observed voters as they cast their ballots in booths that were partially open to public gaze. At several polling stations, officials failed to observe regulations meant to prevent fraud, such as totaling ballots at the end of the voting.  Both local and foreign observers were invited to monitor the balloting, but their credentials were distributed only late on the evening before the election, making it impossible for them to observe any pre-election activities, such as registration and campaigning, and making it difficult for some to reach distant polling stations in time for the start of the vote the next day.","Africa, Rwanda",""

It called on the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) to take steps immediately to enforce the order and grant access to independent observers to monitor compliance.  The governing body of the International Labour Organization (ILO) will be meeting in Geneva next week to review Burma's progress toward eradicating a practice that is in clear violation of international human rights standards.  In November 2000, the ILO governing body adopted a resolution urging international organizations and governments to """"reassess"""" their relationship with the SPDC to avoid contributing to the use of forced labor. While the resolution was vaguely worded, many interpreted it as a call to stiffen sanctions against Burma. The ILO action came just days after the SPDC's October 27, 2000 decree instructing all local officials to stop using forced labor except in public emergencies. The order states explicitly that violators will be penalized under Section 374 of the Burmese penal code, which provides for the punishment of anyone found to be compelling others to work against their will. """"Either the Burmese government thought it could avoid international pressure by a sham decree or it just has made no effort to enforce the ban,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director for Human Rights Watch. """"Neither of these interpretations shows the government in a very good light.""""  In interviews conducted in Thailand's Chiang Mai province in late February, Human Rights Watch talked with a number of Burmese who had been recently subjected to forced labor. One ethnic Shan farmer said that in January 2001, a local unit of the Burmese military had forced him to dig trenches and fence-post holes for a military base in Ton Hu in Shan State's Nam Zarng Township. The farmer and some twenty other villagers had to travel to the site five times during the month for two to three days at a time. Villagers had to bring their own food, sleep at the work site and were not compensated in any way for their labor. Of a dozen Shan villagers interviewed by Human Rights Watch, eleven said that either they or a family member had been subjected to forced labor since the government ban was declared. Reports from many other states in Burma suggest that forced labor continues to varying degrees.  The SPDC claimed to have circulated the order to local level civil and military authorities, and Human Rights Watch said its interviews indicated that indeed, the order had been widely circulated to village headmen. Burmese villagers interviewed in Thailand two weeks ago were also aware of the order.  """"Since the directive was clearly circulated, the Burmese government has to explain why the practice is continuing,"""" said Jones. """"We also need to know how widespread the practice continues to be, and that is only going to be possible through systematic monitoring.""""  For many years the Burmese government, especially the army, has requisitioned village labor to build roads and dams, maintain army bases, construct temples, guard villages, and porter for military patrols. Villagers receive no pay, must supply their own food, and have been threatened with imprisonment should they refuse to participate. Porters have been beaten and killed when they tire under their heavy burdens.","Asia, Myanmar (Burma)","Economic Justice and Rights, Children's Rights, Child Labor"

The 1984 report of the Argentine truth commission names 8,961 people who were """"disappeared"""" under the military dictatorship, noting that this figure is not exhaustive. A number of high-level officials, including members of the military junta, were criminally prosecuted and convicted in the 1980s for these abuses. However, the vast majority of military perpetrators were covered by the country's amnesty laws, while pardons issued by then-President Menem in 1989 and 1990 freed those who had been convicted.  Eleven former military officials, including the president of the first military junta, have recently been arrested in conjunction with prosecutions involving """"disappeared"""" children, a category of crimes not covered by the amnesty laws.

The overwhelming majority of countries respect international human rights standards opposing the use of the death penalty against mentally disabled defendants. Even in the United States, many states that have the death penalty observe these standards. Other states, including Missouri, are considering legislation that would exempt people with mental retardation from the death penalty.

""""Washington is one of the largest producers and exporters of mines in the past, and one of the largest stockpilers today.

Nearly 200 members of the Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL), from about ninety countries, and another 250 campaigners from forty-five U.S. states will participate in a series of meetings and events in Washington throughout the week. Human Rights Watch is a co-founder of the ICBL.  Human Rights Watch issued a Fact Sheet containing new information about use of U.S.-made antipersonnel mines around the world, U.S. mine exports, and U.S. spending on mine clearance and mine victim assistance programs.  The United States is not among the 139 countries that have signed the Mine Ban Treaty, which prohibits all use, production, trade, and stockpiling of antipersonnel mines. Current policy calls for the U.S. to join the treaty in 2006 if the Pentagon has found alternatives to antipersonnel mines. The Bush Administration has yet to make any statement on antipersonnel mines.  Human Rights Watch research shows that in the next fiscal year (FY 2002), funding for the Pentagon's search for alternatives to landmines will surpass funding for humanitarian mine programs.  The U.S. exported over 5.6 million antipersonnel mines to at least thirty-eight countries between 1969 and 1992. The U.S. still has the third largest stockpile of antipersonnel mines in the world, more than 11 million, including stocks in twelve foreign countries, five of which have signed the Mine Ban Treaty.  The U.S. ranks eleventh among major donor countries when mine action funding is considered on a per capita basis and thirteenth when that funding is taken as a percentage of GDP.  Human Rights Watch urges that the role of mines should be part of the review of the U.S. military structure and weapons ordered in February 2001 by the Bush Administration. Many military experts have argued that antipersonnel mines have little to no utility in the war fighting principles currently being developed and adopted by the U.S. military for the twenty-first century.  Human Rights Watch calls on President Bush to submit the Mine Ban Treaty to the Senate for its advice and consent for accession, and through executive actions begin immediate implementation of the treaty's provisions. Short of joining the treaty, there are other important steps in the right direction that President Bush could take:  · Declare a ban on the production of antipersonnel mines. · Immediately commit the United States to a policy of no use of antipersonnel mines in joint operations (NATO and otherwise) with states that have signed the Mine Ban Treaty. Similarly, commit the United States to a policy of no transiting of antipersonnel mines across the territory, air space, or waters of Mine Ban Treaty signatory states. · Instruct the Department of Defense to immediately withdraw all stockpiles of antipersonnel mines from countries that have signed the Mine Ban Treaty. · Take steps necessary to insure that any systems resulting from the Pentagon's landmine alternative programs are compliant with the Mine Ban Treaty. · Remove from consideration the battlefield override feature of the dumb mine replacement program. · Eliminate the RADAM program.","United States","Arms, Landmines"

In a March 1 letter to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, Human Rights Watch called on the Bush administration to use its influence with the southern factions to stave off the potential crisis. """"This is a good example of where early and skillful U.S. diplomatic intervention can make all the difference,"""" said Jemera Rone, Sudan researcher for Human Rights Watch.

Human Rights Watch recommended that the U.S. insist that all military support to these groups be stoped and a cease-fire imposed; that the U.S. help convene an all-Nuer meeting in which Nuer could democratically resolve their differences; that the U.S. judiciously use aid to remedy perceived unfairness in the distribution of relief; and that the U.S. also reinforce diplomatically and with material assistance a Nuer-Dinka Wunlit peace agreement that is threatened by the factional fighting. """"The U.S. has tremendous clout with southerners. Now is the time to use it,"""" Rone said. While the U.S. does not have similar clout with the Sudan government and its Nuer militias, it should advocate that the Sudan government stop interfering with relief deliveries and stop arming its abusive Nuer militias, said Rone. Sudan is in the eighteenth year of a civil war that pits the Arab and Muslim-dominated central government against marginalized African peoples. The Africans live mostly in the southern third of the one-million-mile-square country, the largest in Africa.

We are alarmed by recent military developments there that threaten to spiral out of control, which could result in enormous cost to civilian lives. We urge the Bush administration to intervene diplomatically with southern military factions and civilian leadership in an effort to halt the tribally-related violence.   The United States has considerable influence among all southerners. It is therefore essential that the U.S. use its leverage with both the Dinka and Nuer communities - respectively the largest and second largest African tribes in the south - to head off the threatened bloodbath. The Bush administration should work first to bring together Nuer leaders who are already feuding, and then to preventively bring together Nuer and Dinka leaders to resolve their simmering conflict.   Despite the complexity of the situation in southern Sudan, early and skillful U.S. diplomatic intervention could make a significant difference in sparing the lives of tens of thousands of civilians. The Nuer-Nuer fighting, a war within a war, for now overshadows the civil war in ferocity of fighting and cost in civilian lives. But it is also very integral to the civil war, which since 1983 pits the Khartoum government against marginalized peoples, particularly Africans in the southern third of the country.   The current crisis also involves the unraveling of the Wunlit agreement, signed in 1999 and enthusiastically endorsed by the U.S., which put an end to years (1991-99) of Dinka-Nuer cross-border raids. These raids involved thousands of civilian casualties, large-scale theft of cattle, abduction of women and children, and destruction of hundreds of villages. Attacks on civilians and the ruin of the pastoral economy were the immediate cause of the devastating 1993 famine in southern Sudan, in which tens of thousands perished. The current fighting follows the same pattern, and recurrence of famine is almost inevitable unless immediate action is taken.   As usual, a key actor in the current violence among southerners is the Khartoum government, which arms whichever factions and militias are fighting the SPLA. The Khartoum strategy of divide and destroy has worked extremely well in the past, keeping southerners split - Dinka from Nuer, and Nuer from Nuer. Accordingly, Wunlit was the government´s worst nightmare, and its disintegration serves Khartoum well. By provoking divisions among Nuer and other southerners, Khartoum can develop the rich oil resources that lie beneath Nuer territory. A further analysis of the current fighting is attached as an appendix.   In order to prevent new rounds of civilian devastation, we urge the U.S. to immediately take the following diplomatic steps, in coordination with its allies:  Assume the lead in convening an urgent all-Nuer reconciliation conference in southern Sudan through the New Sudan Council of Churches (NSCC).  Encourage the Nuer community to settle differences through democratic procedures and end the Nuer-Nuer fighting.  Focus on preventing impunity for perpetrators of human rights abuses;  Follow up with reinforcement of the Nuer-Dinka peace agreement signed in Wunlit in 1999 under NSCC auspices, urging the reconvening of already-chosen delegates as a way for both communities to agree on means to prevent an imminent outbreak of Nuer-Dinka fighting.  Provide substantial material support for Wunlit projects;  Insist that the largest rebel group, the Sudan People´s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLA), stop sending military support to its Nuer factions and rein in its primary Nuer commander, Cmdr. Peter Gatdet, who is responsible for burning and destroying villages and conducting summary executions of civilians in the recent fighting in Western Upper Nile;  Request the government of Sudan to stop providing military supplies to its Nuer militias in Upper Nile, which are responsible for abuses such as the killing of civilians and burning of villages - as well as the use of antipersonnel land mines in Eastern Upper Nile;  Call on Riek Machar and his Sudan People´s Democratic Front/Defense Forces (SPDF) to cease retaliatory scorched earth raids on Nuer villages; Urge that all parties implement an immediate cease-fire and start preparations for peace and reconciliation conferences in Upper Nile and eastern Bahr El Ghazal.  The cease-fire should prohibit troop movement as well as resupply; Move immediately to rectify imbalances in relief deliveries so that the underserved communities involved, such as the Bul Nuer, receive food and nonfood items as needed;  Use all possible leverage to convince the government of Sudan to take a hands-off position on relief access to the affected areas. The Sudan government´s attention should be drawn to the world´s interest in avoiding a famine similar to the one precipitated by the Khartoum government´s ban on relief flights in 1998; and  Deliver a strong message to the parties to this conflict - including the Sudan government and its Nuer militias, the SPLA, and Nuer faction leader Riek Machar - that the world will not sit by while they destroy the Nuer community; deliver that same message to the commanders doing or directing the fighting.   We believe that immediate diplomatic intervention by the Bush administration could help prevent humanitarian disaster, the destruction of the Wunlit peace agreement, and the devastation of the Nuer of southern Sudan.

In a February 23 letter to U.S. Secretary of State Powell, Human Rights Watch pointed out that Yugoslav authorities had failed to arrest and hand over any of the Serb and Yugoslav officials, including former President Slobodan Milosevic, who have been indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.   The U.S. Congress laid down strict guidelines in the 2001 Foreign Operations Assistance Act, prohibiting the U.S. government from continuing aid to Belgrade unless Yugoslavia cooperates with the tribunal, including """"the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance in their apprehension."""" According to the legislation, the Bush administration must decide by March 31, 2001 whether to halt U.S. aid.   Although Yugoslav authorities seem poised to arrest former President Milosevic, Human Rights Watch said that his arrest and possible trial for corruption in Belgrade would not in any way constitute cooperation with the international tribunal in The Hague.   """"Now that the arrest of Milosevic seems imminent, the U.S. government must be firmer than ever about the need to cooperate with the international tribunal,"""" said Holly Cartner, executive director of the Europe and Central Asia division of Human Rights Watch. """"This would be the worst possible moment to relax the conditions on U.S. aid. The Bush administration must send a clear message to the authorities in Belgrade, that no money except humanitarian aid will flow from Washington until they start handing over indictees to The Hague.""""   Along with former President Milosevic, four senior Yugoslav and Serb officials and former officials have been charged with crimes against humanity committed by troops under their command in Kosovo in early 1999. During that period, their forces conducted a brutal campaign in which thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed and more than 800,000 were forced out of the province. On many occasions, groups of ethnic Albanians were systematically executed by Serbian special police or paramilitaries.   In addition to the five charged with crimes against humanity in Kosovo, three Yugoslav Army officials remain at liberty in Yugoslavia despite their indictment on charges relating to the capture of Vukovar in Croatia in November 1991. At Vukovar, more than 250 Croats were seized from a hospital and slaughtered. One of these officers is still serving in Yugoslavia's Army.   Former Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic is living in Belgrade. Radovan Karadzic, formerly president of the Bosnian Serb Republic, is also at large and believed to have traveled to Yugoslavia in recent months. These two were charged with genocide in connection with the massacre of 7,000 Bosnian men after the fall of Srebrenica in July 1995, the largest single killing in Europe since World War II.   Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has argued that transferring indictees to The Hague would """"destabilize"""" his new, more democratic government in Belgrade. In fact, said Human Rights Watch, allowing the indictees to remain at liberty will only encourage the most violent and lawless elements in Serbia. Human Rights Watch's own research in Bosnia and Croatia has shown that the transfer of indictees to the Hague can facilitate democracy and be a first step toward greater stability in the region.   The record of Croatia's cooperation with the Tribunal under late president Tudjman also demonstrates the importance of a principled U.S. stance on the issue. Twelve Bosnian Croats surrendered to the Tribunal in 1997 as a result of the U.S. threat to veto International Monetary Fund and World Bank loans to the country. The 2001 Foreign Operations Assistance Act stipulates similar conditionality for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.   """"A forceful U.S. position on Croatia's cooperation with the Tribunal was instrumental to the transfer of indictees to the Hague,"""" said Cartner. """"Nothing less is required in U.S. relations with Yugoslavia. U.S. law is unambiguous on this point, and the new U.S. administration must be unambiguous, too.""""","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Croatia, Serbia/Kosovo, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The Nuer are already conducting inter-Nuer warfare. In addition, the Nuer and the Dinka are currently poised to go to war against each other; the Dinka are the largest tribe in southern Sudan, and the Nuer, the second largest. They are neighbors and cousins, sharing many customs and beliefs. History has shown that peace in the south is impossible if these two tribes are fighting each other.   The way that inter-Nuer and Nuer-Dinka war have been conducted recently is in violation of both traditional Nuer and Dinka practices of war and international humanitarian law, namely: burning homes, villages, community structures, and grain, and killing women and children. These types of abuses have been the proximate cause of several famines in recent years.   One example was the famine that hit the East Bank of the Nile in 1993, where tens of thousands died in the """"Hunger Triangle"""" (formed by Adok, Waat, and Kongor, villages straddling the Nuer/Dinka divide). This crisis was precipitated by Nuer/Dinka fighting (1991-93), also in disregard of tribal and international rules of war, which grew out of the 1991 split in the Sudan People´s Liberation Army (SPLA) led by Riek Machar.   The fighting in 2001 is not traditional tribal conflict, because many other actors with their own agendas have inserted themselves. In addition to the government army, the other organized military players sharing the blame for this looming disaster are the government-backed Nuer militias, particularly the militias of Gordon Kong Chuol and Simon Gatwich; the Sudan People´s Democratic Front/Defense Forces (SPDF) of Nuer leader Riek Machar; and the SPLA.   In Eastern Upper Nile, the Nuer government militias and Sudan army are fighting against Riek Machar SPDF (Nuer) forces and the SPLA. Militia Cmdr. Gordon Kong of Nasir is active in trying to drive out these forces from areas adjacent to oilfields that are in development. In the process many civilians have been killed and forcibly displaced. His militia has even placed landmines in the compounds of relief organizations.   In Central Upper Nile, other SPLA (Nuer) forces have fought the SPDF (Nuer), with the result that government forces have captured towns not in government control for more than a decade. Cmdr. Simon Gatwich, another Nuer pro-government militia leader, joined the fighting, and reportedly threatened to lead a Nuer retaliatory attack on the Dinka.   Riek Machar, formerly military and political leader of the rebel Nuer, has compounded these Nuer divisions. He started out as a rebel, split from the SPLA (and began cooperating with the Khartoum government) in 1991, and in 1996 reached a formal agreement with Khartoum. In 2000 he resigned from the government and formed another rebel faction, the SPDF. However, he made so many enemies that it now appears that the Nuer government militias and other Nuer joined informally with the SPLA to put an end to Riek Machar´s career. The Riek Machar SPDF forces initially received some SPLA military supplies, but when those dried up in mid-2000, they turned back to the government, their supplier of last resort. In recent months, SPDF forces are accused of carrying out scorched earth campaigns in the Nuer villages of Nhialdu and Mankien (the base of rival SPLA Nuer forces under Cmdr. Peter Gatdet).   The situation was further exacerbated by the SPLA´s entry into the fray, which threatens to broaden the conflict into a Nuer/Dinka clash. Nuer commander Peter Gatdet defected from a government militia in 1999 and joined the SPLA. His followers, the Bul Nuer and others, are strategically situated on the edge of the oilfields currently under development by international oil companies in Western Upper Nile. While Cmdr. Peter Gatdet in 1999-2000 attacked these targets - where civilian population is thin due to prior forced displacement by the government - in 2001 the Peter Gatdet SPLA forces ranged far from the oilfields. Apparently with SPLA logistical support from Rumbek and possibly with Dinka SPLA soldiers, the Gatdet SPLA forces attacked heavily-populated Nuer territory more than one hundred miles to the south of the oilfields - a considerable distance in view of the lack of roads and surfeit of flooding and swamps. There, in Pabuong and Nyal, the Peter Gatdet (Nuer) SPLA fought against Riek Machar´s SPDF troops and burned out the civilian population, forcing them to flee. Members of Peter Gatdet´s forces suggest this was in retaliation for similar raids earlier this year on Peter Gatdet´s home turf by SPDF Cmdr. Peter Paar.   The immediate danger of SPLA (Nuer) versus Riek Machar/SPDF (Nuer) fighting is that many Nuer see the SPLA as a Dinka army and consider this SPLA advance into Nyal a Dinka advance into Nuer territory. Now Nuer talk of taking """"revenge"""" on the Dinka and attacking Dinka villages. This imperils not only Dinka civilians who have moved back to their border villages on the West Bank of the Nile, trusting in Wunlit. It also exposes to danger of retaliation the tens of thousands of Nuer internally displaced persons who took refuge in Dinka areas, likewise trusting in Wunlit. These displaced Nuer were expelled from their homes by the Khartoum government in 1999-2000 to erect a cordon sanitaire for the oil companies.   Another complicating factor is the presence of international relief. The SPLA (Nuer) see their attacks on the Riek Machar forces as a type of """"getting even"""" for the fact that the SPLA (Nuer) have been starved and denied their """"fair share"""" of international aid by the Riek Machar faction. There is no doubt that the SPLA (Nuer) area has not been receiving as much aid as other areas; there are many reasons for that.   One reason is that the international aid community has not been diligent enough in the past year and a half in addressing this situation. Judicious attention to this real or perceived grievance could play a large role in smoothing the waters. In 1991, the perceived lack of fairness in distribution of relief among Dinka and Nuer led, in part, to a devastating series of raids by Nuer into Dinka Bor County, known as the """"Bor Massacre,"""" where an estimated 2,000 Dinka civilians were killed.","Africa, Sudan",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/03/01/oil-diagnostic-angola-update","The Oil Diagnostic in Angola- An Update","The Oil Diagnostic in Angola: An Update","","03/01/2001","On April 3, 2000, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Angolan government announced the beginning of a Staff Monitored Program (SMP). This program is an ambitious agreement to implement a wide range of economic and institutional reforms in Angola that could lead to further lending and cooperation with the IMF and World Bank, but it is unclear whether the government will be able to comply with its requirements. The SMP includes a provision to monitor oil revenues known as the """"Oil Diagnostic.""""1 Human Rights Watch believes that should the Oil Diagnostic be implemented, it could mark a limited, but positive first step toward promoting transparency, accountability, and good governance in Angola and, ultimately, greater respect for human rights. But there are pitfalls in the process that could impede the success of this program. This backgrounder details recent developments regarding the Oil Diagnostic and other issues related to oil and human rights in Angola.   The World Bank and government of Angola are supervising the Oil Diagnostic and, KPMG, an international accounting and consulting firm, is implementing it. The diagnostic is not a comprehensive audit despite persistent allegations of government corruption and financial mismanagement. It is principally a forward-looking agreement to monitor oil revenues; to help the Angolan government develop an effective mechanism for determining how much revenue the central bank should receive from oil production; and to encourage good governance.2 The first Oil Diagnostic report is due in April 2001.3   The Oil Diagnostic is particularly significant because oil revenue has been and remains the Angolan government's principal source of income, and has generated most of the resources enabling the government to pursue its conflict with Jonas Savimbi's rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) movement. Between 1995-1999, oil revenues comprised approximately 70 to 89 percent of government revenues and approximately 85 to 92 percent of exports, according to the IMF.4 In 2000, oil accounted for U.S. $3.26 billion of government revenue.5 On February 23, 2001, the Angolan government announced that oil revenues would account for 90.5 percent of the current year's budget, or approximately U.S. $3.18 billion.6   The opaqueness of the Angolan government's budget and expenditures has generated concern among multilateral financial institutions, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), corporations, and governments, as well as within Angola itself. At issue are the use of public funds, derived from oil revenues, to secretly finance arms purchases and the mortgaging of future oil revenues in return for immediate oil-backed loans to the government. In some cases in the recent past, oil revenues bypassed the Ministry of Finance and the central bank (the Banco Nacional de Angola, or BNA) and went through the state-owned oil company, Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola (Sonangol), or through the Presidency, and were used secretly to procure weapons.7 This sparked allegations of official corruption.8 The government's lack of transparency engendered further controversy in June 2000 when André Tarallo, former Africa director of France's Elf Aquitaine (now TotalFina-Elf) oil company, testified to French authorities that Elf kept a multimillion dollar slush fund, derived from oil proceeds (up to U.S. $0.40/barrel went into the fund), in Liechtenstein. These funds were allegedly used to pay African leaders, including Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos, from the 1970s to 1990s.9 Dos Santos and TotalFina-Elf have denied the allegations.10   The Angolan government's practices have not met basic standards for fiscal transparency and accountability, such as those detailed in the IMF's Code of Good Practices for Fiscal Transparency. The code calls for open disclosure and reporting in order to encourage public debate about fiscal policy and ensure governmental accountability.11 The secret dealings of the government made it impossible for the Angolan public and media to hold the government accountable for its use of public funds. In addition, the government has responded to public and press criticism of its use of the country's oil revenues by clamping down on journalists and restricting freedom of expression. In this regard, fiscal transparency, political accountability, and human rights are inextricably intertwined in Angola.   Further Details on the Oil Diagnostic    The initial agreement to carry out the Oil Diagnostic was reached in April 2000, but procedural delays held up the announcement of the monitoring contract for several months. On November 20, 2000, the Angolan government announced that the international accounting and consulting firm KPMG had been awarded the U.S. $1.6 million contract to conduct the Oil Diagnostic. The government will pay 68 percent of the costs of the program while the World Bank will pay the remainder.12   The Oil Diagnostic will not examine how the government uses its oil revenues after they are deposited in the central bank. To do this, the government should be required to publish a detailed budget and an account of actual expenditures. The purpose of the Oil Diagnostic will be to assess only whether the amount of oil revenues generated are equal to the amount of funds deposited in the central bank, and to develop mechanisms that enable the government to monitor revenues accurately. To achieve these goals, KPMG will be responsible for carrying out the following seven components:   • The creation of a database that contains an assessment of proven and probable oil reserves, production, and exports.   • The development of projections of export oil prices, production, exports, and subsequent revenues payable to the government on a quarterly basis from mid-2000 to the end of 2001, and annually until 2005.   • Monitoring of the actual revenues received by the government and comparing these figures to the projections of revenues on a quarterly basis from June 2000 to December 2001. This includes signature bonus payments.   • Assessing the government's existing monitoring of exports, the government's data management, and financial and procurement procedures.   • Providing recommendations to improve institutional and regulatory controls within the government to """"support the sound management of oil revenues.""""   • Designing and implementing a monitoring system for the government so that it can accurately assess oil revenues.   • Training of Angolan staff and providing proposals for institutional strengthening so that the government can continue monitoring of oil revenues.13   Ideally, this agreement will lead to a substantial improvement in the government's management of oil revenues and greater transparency and accountability in its use of such income. However, the agreement has limitations that could hinder such developments. These include:   • The government of Angola has not made a commitment to make the KPMG reports public, although one of the key objectives of the Oil Diagnostic is """"to assist the Government in increasing transparency with respect to revenues from petroleum production.""""14 The Oil Diagnostic reports are technically the property of the Angolan government, and it has given no commitment to make the reports public. This is particularly troubling. According to the IMF Code of Good Practices for Fiscal Transparency, """"a public commitment should be made [by the government] to the timely publication of fiscal information;"""" and """"the integrity of fiscal information should be subject to public and independent scrutiny.""""15 Moreover, recent World Bank research suggests that media independence, judicial independence, and public scrutiny are crucial for ensuring government accountability in countries where there is weak governance.16 Human Rights Watch urges the Angolan government to make a firm commitment to release all Oil Diagnostic reports to the public as soon as they become available, and to ensure that they are disseminated in Portuguese.   • The IMF and World Bank cannot release the Oil Diagnostic reports without the government's permission, even though they receive copies of the reports and the World Bank is funding approximately 32 percent of the diagnostic. KPMG is not allowed to release these reports independently because it is a government contractor, and the reports are considered government property. The IMF and the World Bank could insist that the government publish the reports as a measure of the successful implementation of the Oil Diagnostic, and a condition for further cooperation between these institutions and the government. So far, the IMF has said that it will insist on the public release of the reports, but not what it will do if the government refuses to publish the reports.17 Human Rights Watch believes that the World Bank and the IMF should insist that the government release the Oil Diagnostic reports as an explicit requirement of any further cooperation with the international financial institutions.   • It is not clear that the Angolan government will have the capacity to independently report on oil revenues by the time that the Oil Diagnostic expires in 2002. KPMG is responsible for comparing projected with actual revenues during the last two quarters of 2000, and throughout 2001. KPMG's first report is due in April 2001, and is expected to include their initial assessment of oil revenues. Subsequently, KPMG is to submit reports to the Angolan government, the World Bank, and the IMF every three months until the agreement ends. During this time, KPMG will also provide monthly updates on its findings to the Angolan government.18 After the final KPMG report, the government is expected to assume direct monitoring itself. However, it is by no means clear that the government will have the capacity to report on these issues independently by the end of 2002. Human Rights Watch urges the World Bank, IMF, and the Angolan government to continue the diagnostic under the auspices of the IMF and World Bank until the government adequately demonstrates its ability to publicly report on these matters.   • The Oil Diagnostic is not retroactive despite previous controversies over oil-for-arms deals and oil mortgaging. KPMG is expected to examine data going back to approximately 1998 as a basis for comparison with current production and revenues.19 It is not clear whether this data will be included in the quarterly monitoring reports. Human Rights Watch believes that the pre-2000 data should be included in the first Oil Diagnostic report.   • The government should provide a detailed and public accounting in response to any discrepancies identified by KMPG. If discrepancies emerge between the projected and actual revenues deposited in the central bank, the Oil Diagnostic requires only that the government provide a """"sufficient explanation"""" of such discrepancies.20 In some cases, discrepancies may be due to fluctuations in oil prices, changes in the price of oil due to variation in oil quality, or lesser (or greater) production than initially recorded.21 However, other types of discrepancies are also possible-such as off-the-books arms purchases or loan repayments funneled through Sonangol or the Presidency. KPMG's ability to account for these discrepancies is completely dependent on the quality of information it receives from the government. It is critically important, therefore, that the government should provide-and the multilateral institutions insist on-the most thorough, verifiable, and public explanation from the government of all discrepancies to establish transparency and accountability.   • The Oil Diagnostic is not an investigation into the use or misuse of oil revenues by individuals within the government. In fact, the agreement between KPMG and the government explicitly states that """"the consultants [KPMG] shall not be expected or required to consider or investigate or conduct any form of enquiry into the conduct, practices, honesty, integrity or standards of, or nature or quality of work performed by, any person who has or may have had, any involvement in or connection with, directly or indirectly, the facts, matters, circumstances or events which shall be diagnosed, monitored, studied, assessed or considered by the consultants during the performance of these services."""" [original emphasis] 22 Rather than avoiding a full audit, Human Rights Watch strongly believes that the IMF, World Bank, and government of Angola should negotiate a comprehensive audit of discrepancies if such discrepancies emerge.   • As yet, it remains unclear whether the Angolan government will make public KPMG's final report and recommendations, as it should do, and subsequently report on its progress in implementing those recommendations. KPMG will have eighteen months from the end of 2001 to prepare a final report to the government, IMF, and World Bank. This report will contain recommendations, including safeguards against """"concluding of contracts for the procurement of goods and services without adequate competitive bidding or on a basis other than arm's length; and any other fraudulent or unprofessional practices which it [KPMG] deems worthy of attention.""""23 Given the serious nature of the recommendations likely to be made, Human Rights Watch believes it is essential that the Angolan government should publish this final report in full, and should subsequently issue further information periodically to report on its implementation of those recommendations to the Angolan public   1 In addition to the Oil Diagnostic, the monitoring program sets out a series of ambitious reforms that the government must undertake before becoming eligible for Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility loans from the international financial institutions, including: creating an integrated financial management system; eliminating domestic fuel subsidies; limiting subsidies to indebted state-owned enterprises; eliminating tax exemptions that are not a part of international agreements; eliminating import licenses and non-tariff barriers; simplifying commercial licensing; progressively adjusting tariffs for public services such as water and electricity to market levels; liquidate the Caixa de Credito Agropecuria (CAP); defining a strategy to deal with the country's external debt; clearing arrears payments to multilateral financial institutions; gradually eliminating external commercial credits to the central bank; creating a register of debt service payments, including oil-backed loans; preparing a restructuring of the financial system, including privatization of state banks; revising of the special foreign exchange regime; presenting a policy document on privatization; implementing a pilot program involving the privatization of five state-owned companies; publishing comprehensive statistics on government accounts and macroeconomic indices; and preparing a plan for tax reform. 2 In June and September 2000, Human Rights Watch released """"The International Monetary Fund's Staff Monitoring Program for Angola: The Human Rights Implications"""" a backgrounder that detailed certain provisions and weaknesses of the Oil Diagnostic and recommendations to ensure greater transparency and accountability on the part of the Angolan government. Some statistical figures regarding government revenues and expenditures have been revised since the release of this document, reflecting updated information by the World Bank and IMF. 3 Additionally, the international accounting and consulting firm, Ernst & Young, is conducting an audit of the Angolan central bank (the Banco Nacional de Angola, or BNA) that should be completed by March 2001. The state-owned diamond company, Empresa Nacional de Diamantes de Angola (ENDIAMA), has agreed to conduct its own diamond diagnostic. The IMF and World Bank may negotiate a more comprehensive study of the diamond sector after reviewing the findings of the ENDIAMA diagnostic. 4 International Monetary Fund (IMF), Angola: Recent Economic Developments, IMF Staff Country Report Number 00/111, August 2000 pp. 13, 41. In general, the country's reliance on oil peaked in 1995 but appears to have surpassed this in 2001. 5 Government of Angola, Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies, memorandum for the IMF, February 2001. 6 Ibid; and """"2001 State Budget Presented,"""" ANGOP, February 23, 2001. According to recent estimates, Angola produces approximately 766,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd). Oil production is estimated to increase to 1 million bpd by the end of 2001 and 1.4 million bpd by 2003.The vast majority (approximately 474,000 bpd) of oil production occurs in Block 0 located offshore the enclave of Cabinda. The companies involved are a joint venture between Sonangol (41 percent), TotalFina-Elf (10 percent), ENI-Agip (9.8 percent), and the operator Chevron (39.2 percent) through its Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) subsidiary. At the end of 1999, total production in Block 0 reached 510,000 bpd, or approximately 67 percent of Angola's total oil production. The second largest area of production is Block 3 located offshore the northern coast of Angola, producing approximately 174,000 bpd. TotalFina-Elf (50 percent) is the operator and the other joint-venture partners include Ajoco (25 percent), ENI-Agip (15 percent), INA-Naftaplin (5 percent), and Naftagas (5 percent). Block 2, offshore of the northern city of Soyo produce approximately 84,000 bpd and is a joint venture between the operator Texaco (20 percent), Petrobras (27.5 percent), TotalFina-Elf (27.5 percent), and Sonangol (25 percent). 7 Human Rights Watch, Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process (New York: Human Rights Watch, 1999), p. 95, citing Human Rights Watch interview with a Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) representative, Luanda, August 1998. 8 See, for example: Global Witness, """"A Crude Awakening: The Role of the Oil and Banking Industries in Angola's Civil War and the Plunder of State Assets,"""" December 1999. 9 Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), """"Angola: Country Report,"""" August 2000, p. 18; Paul Webster, """"Elf Spent Dollars 60 m a Year on Bribes, Investigators Told,"""" The Guardian, July 12, 2000; and """"New Corruption Allegations at French Oil Group Elf,"""" Reuters, July 11, 2000. 10 """"Angola Denies Elf Charges,"""" The Oil Daily, July 21, 2000; and """"Angolan President Refutes Elf Bribe Claims,"""" Hart's Africa Oil and Gas, July 26, 2000. 11 IMF, Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency-Declaration of Principles.

For example, see """"Signature Bonuses In Angola 'Much Higher' Than Expected-Sonangol,"""" Dow Jones Energy Service, April 13, 1999. Based on the figures supplied in the BP annual report, the calculated total appears to be approximately U.S. $333 million. Since joint-venture partners in oil blocks pay amounts according to their percent ownership of the block, the BP payment represented 26.67 percent of the total bonus payment. The total bonus payment would have been about U.S. $416,531,684, but Sonangol is a 20 percent owner of the block and would not have paid a bonus payment, so 20 percent (approximately U.S. $83,306,336) of the total can be subtracted. The new total, minus Sonangol's share, would be approximately U.S. $333,225,347, which is consistent with estimates that the bonus payment would be about U.S. $350 million. Based on this figure, Exxon-Mobil (25 percent) paid approximately U.S. $104,132,921; Statoil (13.33 percent) paid approximately U.S. $55,398,714; Marathon Oil (10 percent) paid approximately U.S. $41,653,168; and TotalFina-Elf (5 percent) paid approximately U.S. $20,826,584. 33 Government of Angola, Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies, memorandum to the IMF, February 2001. 34 Angola: Recent Economic Developments, p. 43. 35 Human Rights Watch interview with a representative of the Angolan Ministry of Defense, Luanda, August 1998. 36 Angola: Recent Economic Developments, p. 43. 37 Ibid. 38 For a comprehensive account of violations by all parties to the conflict see generally Angola Unravels; and Human Rights Watch, Angola: Arms Trade and Violations of the Laws of War Since the 1992 Elections (New York: Human Rights Watch, 1994). 39 Human Rights Watch field work in Angola in August 1998.

The Guinean military was apparently attacking in the vicinity of Sierra Leonean rebel forces, which have been launching attacks across the border and causing massive refugee flows from camps inside Guinea back to Sierra Leone. Witnesses said the helicopter gunship and artillery attacks had caused little damage to rebel forces, but had killed at least 41 civilians, including 11 children, since September 2000.   Human Rights Watch called on the Guinean government to halt all indiscriminate attacks and to ensure that its forces respect international humanitarian law, and called on the Sierra Leonean government to demand that its civilians be protected. The Government of Sierra Leone has yet to condemn the attacks against its own citizens.   """"Instead of attacking the rebels, the Guinean military has attacked the victims of the rebels,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Civilians have borne the brunt of ten years of civil war in Sierra Leone, and unfortunately, the Guinean government is now making things worse for them.""""   Human Rights Watch has spoken with witnesses and victims from twelve attacks, all within areas under the control of rebels from the Revolutionary United Front (RUF). The attacks, which took place in the Kambia, Bombali and Koinadugu districts of the country, also caused serious destruction of property and resulted in the displacement of thousands of civilians. These attacks, five by helicopter gunship and seven using artillery, took place in and around the towns of Rokupr, Yeliboya, Makasa, Kakuna, Sabuya, Mambolo, Rokel and Kamakwie. In the most recent incidents, on February 15, four civilians all from the same extended family were killed when an artillery shell crashed into the village of Sabuya, in Northern Kambia district. On the same day, artillery shells killed a three-year-old girl in Rokel village, also in Kambia district. The most serious attacks involved the use of helicopter gunships including the November 30, 2000 attack on the town of Rokupr, which killed thirteen civilians, and the January 26 attack against the town of Kamakwie which killed twelve.   While many of the victims and witnesses interviewed by Human Rights Watch confirm the presence of RUF rebels in the area around the time of the attacks, none of the attacks documented seem to have accurately targeted RUF bases or areas of concentration. Instead the gunship rockets and artillery shells slammed into neighborhoods, marketplaces, restaurants and boat wharfs. Witnesses and victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch could only confirm the death of one RUF rebel in the twelve attacks documented.   The Guinean government claims RUF rebels and Liberian security forces have been launching attacks against its territory since September 2000. The attacks have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Guinean civilians, and massive displacement of tens of thousands of Sierra Leonean and Liberian refugees.   Human Rights Watch also strongly condemned RUF attacks against Guinean civilians and refugee camps. In addition, it said the RUF had attempted to impede civilians on Yeliboya island from fleeing after a gunship attack.   The Geneva Conventions prohibit indiscriminate attacks, and require that armed forces take precautions to limit the danger of attacks to civilian populations. Specifically prohibited are attacks """"by bombardment by any method or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city, town [or] village."""" Also prohibited are attacks that """"may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, [and] damage to civilian objects, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.""""   Testimonies   1. Hassan, a twenty-nine-year-old boat owner, described the November 30, 2000 helicopter gunship attack on the town of Rokupr, which left at least thirteen people dead and eleven wounded:  At around l0:00 am, three helicopters approached the town and spread out into different directions. Then one headed straight to the wharf where hundreds of travelers and traders were busy doing business. It was then we realized, though too late, that it was coming for us. There was panic and pandemonium. I heard three deafening booms and then it fired a big gun. After some minutes I came out from hiding and saw what'd happened.  I saw four persons who died on the spot and wounded lying all over; some wailing, some just totally confused. On bomb hit a building under construction and a man who'd tried to hide there was blown to bits. There were some rebels mingling with the civilians but most weren't armed. I heard one rebel had been wounded in the attack. A boat left with the wounded but by the time they reached Lunghi, seven had already died.  2. Sorrie, a twenty-five-year-old student saw the bodies of 12 people killed when on January 26 the town of Kamakwie was attacked by two Guinean helicopter gunships. He confirmed the presence of significant numbers of RUF rebels but said their headquarters was untouched and none of them were injured in the attack. I was sitting on the verandah when we heard what we thought was the sound of a load car backfiring. Then we realized it was the chopper and just then saw two of them heading for town from the West. I ran in and hid under the bed and then heard three loud explosions - everything shook. I was only thinking of my life. After it was over I went around town to see what had happened. The first one fell directly on a house in Section #2; it killed two women and wounded three more. The second one hit near the sacred bush - a place just behind town where we perform our rituals. I stood there while the others dragged l0 bodies out. They were all cut up and many had burned when the bush caught fire. Two more bombs lay unexploded near the Kamasury and Kamayasi streams. One rebel wanted to shoot at it but then another yelled at him and grabbed his gun away. The RUF HQ is in a two story building in area #3 which was about 150 meters away from where the closest bomb dropped.  3. Fatmata, a forty-year-old mother of five, described being hit by shrapnel in the neck and then having her head scarf catch on fire during the January 20 attack by two helicopter gunships on Yeliboya island. There were four civilians killed and at least 11 seriously wounded in the attack.  The first time the gunships came I ran inside my house to hide but my husband rushed in and told me and my two children to come out and stand in the water near the boats. He said it was safer there. I grabbed the children and followed him to the wharf. When my husband was frantically looking for a boat to be able to flee, we saw them approaching again. I was so frightened that I just took off running with my children. Just before reaching the bush for cover, I felt something hot piercing my neck and then fire took over my body. My headscarf had caught fire and then it spread to my arm and hand. My two children were also wounded by fragments and I saw the bodies of two children killed in the attack; one was about eight years old and the other, about one, had been burned when my neighbors house caught fire.  4. Forty-five-year-old Mani, another victim from the Yeliboya attack, described the destruction caused by the gunships' rockets.  In the afternoon, just after prayers, I saw two choppers coming from the direction of Guinea. They got to the wharf, turned, dropped down a little and seemed to hang a little in the air. Then there was dust and explosions and the town began to catch fire. After the first bomb we ran to the bush, but then I decided to try to salvage some of my possessions from my house, which had also caught fire. I ran back to my house but the smoke was too heavy and I had to get out. As I tried to run back to the bush, there was another explosion. It was then I realized I'd been hit. I was bleeding heavily. Five of us from my family were wounded at the same time and my little niece was killed. The 10 or so rebels who lived in Yeliboya live in Pa H's house and in a few houses near the wharf. There were over 50 houses burned that day but none of the ones the RUF used were damaged.  5. A Twenty-five-year-old trader was wounded in the back by shrapnel while trying to protect her children during a December 30, 2000 gunship attack on the village of Makasa:  At around l:00 pm we heard the sound of bombing some distance away in Kambia. Then about 30 minutes later and very suddenly I heard the sound of the chopper approaching our village. I jumped from the verandah and rushed to get my children together so we could run and hide in the bush. I grabbed the two smallest ones but the six year old broke loose and stared running away. When we reached the bush I fell to the ground and got on top of my children to protect them. Then the first one hit. I tried to get up but felt like I was being pressed to the ground. I looked back and saw blood everywhere and was so afraid because I thought it was the blood of my children. Five from my family were wounded that day but at least my children were unharmed.  6. Kadi, a forty-year-old trader, described a February 15, artillery attack on Rokel village which left one child dead and three adults wounded.  I was inside my house cooking when I suddenly heard a long whistling sound, then shhhhhhhh and then a huge explosion. Then there were two more explosions. The bombs fell one after another. The first fell in a small rice paddy in back of the village, the second one in the village and the third, near my house, about 25 meters from the second bomb. I saw that the fragments crushed the head of a little three year old and wounded an old grey-haired Mammy. While the RUF pass through our village they don't really live here - they live in good numbers about 4 miles away in a town called Mambolo.","Africa, Guinea, Sierra Leone","International Justice, Refugees and Migrants, Migrants"

Treaty Is Not Enough, Says Rights Group","02/28/2001","(New York) -- Human Rights Watch today commended the Chinese government for ratifying a key United Nations human rights treaty, but said China must do more to protect the rights of workers. As China prepares to join the World Trade Organization and to dismantle more state-run enterprises, Human Rights Watch said, a growing unemployment rate will require stronger protections for workers.  The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights on February 28, but the official Xinhua News Agency said China's obligations under Article 8 (1) (a), which covers the right to form and join trade unions, would be """"in line with relevant provisions of China's Constitution, Trade Union Law and Labour Law."""" China's precise commitments won't be clear until it deposits its ratification with the U.N. in New York.  """"China must change its domestic laws to protect workers' right of free association - that's absolutely basic,"""" said Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington Director of Human Rights Watch's Asia Division. """"By ratifying this covenant, Beijing is agreeing to respect international standards, and workers' rights are a key part of those standards.""""  The dismantling of state-run enterprises has already created over 20 million unemployed, and once China joins the WTO, pressures will increase on dislocated workers who risk losing medical, educational, housing and other work-related benefits, Jendrzejczyk said.  China's laws recognize only one government-sponsored workers' organization, the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), which exerts leadership over some 590,000 official grassroots unions and their sub-branches. All attempts to organize independent unions have been systematically crushed by the authorities.  Human Rights Watch urged China to immediately begin efforts to reform its labor laws. To help with this process, the Chinese government should accept a request from the International Labor Organization in Geneva last June to send a direct contact mission to China to assist with the full implementation of the right of free association. As a member of the ILO, China is obligated to respect the rights of workers to establish organizations of their own choosing. But the ILO has found that several provisions of China's Trade Union Law contradict this core ILO principle. It urged changes in the law, as well as the release of detained union organizers and the abolition of the system of re-education through labor. The ruling was issued by the ILO's Committee on Freedom of Association acting on a complaint filed in June 1999 by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions in Brussels.  """"If it is really committed to respecting this treaty, the Chinese government should release all those imprisoned for trying to organize workers,"""" said Jendrzejczyk.  Independent labor organizers often face long prison terms. Zhang Shanguang, who tried to organize a free labor union in Hunan province, was sentenced to ten years in prison in 1998, on charges of endangering state security. More recently, Cao Maobing, who attempted to form an independent union at a state-owned silk factory in Jiangsu province, was detained and is now being kept in a mental hospital. He Zhaohui was given a 10-year sentence in Chenzhou, Hunan province, in August 1999, for """"endangering state safety"""" after he organized workers' demonstrations and reported workers' protests to groups overseas.  Those who assist workers in defending their rights have also been targeted. Xu Jian, a registered legal practitioner in Baotou City in Inner Mongolia, helped workers from a state-owned machinery and steel company and distributed leaflets telling laid-off workers about their rights under China's labor laws. He was detained in December 1999, and charged with incitement to overthrow the state, and last July was sentenced to four years imprisonment. Xu Jian had previously worked at the Neimenggu No. 2 Main Machinery Factory in Baotou City.  Human Rights Watch also urged China to promptly ratify, without major reservations, another key U.N. treaty, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it signed in October 1998. The treaty has not yet been submitted to the National People's Congress Standing Committee for ratification.","Asia, China and Tibet","Children's Rights, Child Labor"

Nepal is the site of one of the world's most overlooked refugee dilemmas. Forced to flee Bhutan for Nepal and India in the early 90s, more than 90,000 people are now entering their tenth year of life in the refugee camps in Nepal. A whole generation of children has been born there. Many of the refugees, mostly ethnic Nepali Hindus who farmed the southern hills and plains of Bhutan, were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality prior to their expulsion from Bhutan in the early 1990s after changes to Bhutan's nationality laws that deliberately discriminated against the southern Bhutanese.  The refugees have been caught for nearly a decade in the middle of stalled negotiations to resolve their situation. No progress was made until the tenth round of bilateral talks between the governments of Bhutan and Nepal in December 2000 when international pressure by the U.S. government, the E.U. and various European governments, the U.N. Commission on Human Rights and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees helped break the impasse between the two governments.  During the December 2000 talks, Nepal and Bhutan agreed to commence a joint verification of the refugees in the camps in order to determine their nationality status, with a view to ultimate repatriation to Bhutan. The breakthrough in the talks, and the recent visit by the verification team appointed from both countries to the camps, has brought a renewed sense of hope to the refugees - whose only wish over the past ten years has been to return to their homeland, Bhutan.  While these new developments are promising, many concerns remain about the process of verification and repatriation. In light of reported pressure on refugee groups to refrain from activism, it is particularly important for international organizations, like UNHCR and international NGOs, to monitor the verification process and ensure that it is carried out in accordance with international standards and that the human rights of this group of tens of thousands of refugees are upheld.  The extremely complex questions of nationality and statelessness arising from this refugee situation, have led to fears that many refugees who were arbitrarily stripped of their nationality prior to their expulsion may be denied their legitimate right to return to Bhutan. Thus, UNHCR should be included in the process as an independent third party. There is also a pressing need for a more active UNHCR presence in the refugee camps in Nepal, both to disseminate information about the verification process in order to counter the many rumors and fears that are circulating in the camps, and to closely monitor the verification process itself.  On February 15 the following organizations wrote to the governments of Bhutan and Nepal expressing our concerns about the Bhutanese refugees. A copy of the letter is attached.

Human Rights Watch said that hundreds of Palestinian drivers had been subjected to serious abuse since the beginning of the recent unrest in the West Bank at the end of September, and said that it has received credible reports of similar abuses in Gaza.  Human Rights Watch called on the Israeli authorities to order publicly an immediate end to these abuses, undertake a thorough investigation to bring the perpetrators to account, and compensate the victims.  Since early October 2000, Israel has sealed off nearly all Palestinian towns and villages in the West Bank by placing large concrete blocks or high earthen blockades on all exit roads as well as preventing Palestinian drivers from passing through dozens of permanent and ad-hoc military checkpoints. The only roads that are regularly open to traffic are """"bypass"""" roads that connect Israeli settlements in the West Bank to Israel proper and to each other. Palestinian drivers, officially prohibited from using these roads, have attempted to circumvent the closures and blockades by using alternative minor roads or by risking travel on bypass roads.  """"Israeli soldiers are routinely beating Palestinian drivers, slashing their tires, or shooting at their vehicles simply because they are traveling on roads declared 'closed' by Israeli authorities,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Given the pattern of attacks and frequency of these incidents, we are concerned that the Israeli military leadership is condoning this behavior, and even actively complicit in it.""""  Human Rights Watch said that Israel's policy of sharply restricting Palestinian movement has been in place, with varying degrees of severity, since March 1993, but that the restrictions now in place have been far more extensive. The Israeli-imposed closure has brought the local economy to a virtual standstill, with dire consequences for many ordinary Palestinians, and has seriously impeded access to education, medical assistance, and virtually all other aspects of civilian Palestinian life.  """"The extent and the duration of the closures imposed on the Occupied Territories exceed the requirements of military necessity, as stipulated under international humanitarian law, and very clearly amount to collective punishment,"""" Megally said.  Human Rights Watch researchers working in the Hebron area have documented more than a dozen cases of serious abuses by Israeli security forces against taxi drivers in that district, and continue to receive numerous other reports of similar serious incidents throughout the West Bank. The majority of taxi drivers in the West Bank contacted by Human Rights Watch recounted incidents where they had suffered abuse at the hands of the Israel Defense Force (IDF), in many cases on more than one occasion.  """"The pattern of IDF attacks and harassment against taxi drivers and private Palestinian drivers indicates an effort to stop all Palestinian civilian traffic in the West Bank,"""" Megally said.  Israeli settlers in the West Bank have also created serious problems for Palestinian drivers, setting up their own roadblocks, as well as frequently stoning and shooting at Palestinian cars. In many cases, settlers abuse Palestinians in front of Israeli soldiers or police with little interference from the authorities.  """"Settlers in the West Bank are allowed to attack Palestinian drivers with impunity, and often take the law into their own hands,"""" said Megally. """"Israel has an obligation to safeguard the safety of all residents in the Occupied areas of the West Bank, and it is imperative that Israeli authorities stop standing by while settlers abuse Palestinian civilians.""""  Testimonies from Victims of IDF Attacks  The following Hebron area cases are typical of those recently documented by Human Rights Watch. Family names and other identifying information have been withheld in order to protect the witnesses from possible retaliation by Israeli security forces or settlers.  On February 19, 2001, Khaldoun S., aged twenty, was traveling in a communal taxi with nine other Palestinians, on their way from Yatta to the city of Bethlehem. IDF soldiers and Israeli border police stopped the taxi outside the village of Beit Umar shortly after 8 p.m. The border police ordered all of the passengers out of the van, and began slapping the driver in his face and kicking him. The border police ordered the driver to apologize in person to each of the soldiers and border police before one told him, """"Now get in your van and go home. I don't want to see you here again. If I see you here again, I will kill you."""" After the driver left with the other passengers, the border police officers ordered Khaldoun S. to get in their jeep and drove him to a nearby forest. When the jeep stopped, they ordered Khaldoun S. to get out. He recounted to Human Rights Watch what happened next:  I stepped out of the jeep and [the border police officer] was holding my arm. He pulled his fist back and hit me hard on the mouth. He hit me again, now my head hit the police jeep and I became dizzy. He grabbed a hold of me and banged me several times against the jeep. Then he kneed me hard, in my private parts. Finally I fell to the ground. The policeman kept hitting me with the machinegun, while the other was kicking me in the head. I lost consciousness, when they would hit me I would wake up momentarily.  The police officers left Khaldoun S. in the forest, and he made his way to safety. Khaldoun S. showed Human Rights Watch injuries consistent with his account, including a split lip, loose teeth and bruises on his back.  On February 15 in a small village near Yatta, Te'er Abu U., aged twenty, and his cousin were approached by a man whose car was stuck in the mud. The two cousins took their tractor to the car to pull it out, and met a group of IDF soldiers on a tank at the site. The men were told to take off their jackets and lay down in the mud. Their magnetic ID cards that gave them access rights to Israel proper were confiscated, and they were beaten:  They made us sit in the mud for about one hour, on our knees with our foreheads to the ground, as if we were praying. The soldiers were beating us on our backs with their guns; I was hit hard five or six times.  The cousins were unable to start the tractor when their ordeal was over, and went home to get another tractor to jumpstart it. When they arrived, they found their tractor heavily damaged:  When we returned back with the tractor, we found that the soldiers had cut all of the tires. They also opened the radiator and took the covers of the oil and fuel tanks. The lights were broken, the body was smashed, the windows were broken. The soldiers were still there, about 100 meters away.  Te'er Abu U. estimated the damage to the tractor at 10,000 Shekels (U.S. $2,500).  Mohammed H., a thirty year-old taxi driver, recounted to Human Rights Watch three incidents when IDF soldiers attacked him. During the first incident, several months ago, he was traveling from Hebron to Bethlehem and stopped to drop some passengers near the village of El Khader, near Bethlehem. Two soldiers walked towards him and started cursing him, telling him he was not allowed to go there. One of the soldiers pulled out a knife and cut all four of the car's tires before walking away. Mohammed H said it took 1500 shekels (U.S. $375) to replace the tires, nearly a month's income.  On January 18, Mohammed H. was driving near the entrance to Yatta when he was stopped by an IDF jeep on the Israeli bypass road and told to turn around and return to Yatta. As he was turning, the IDF jeep reversed and smashed into his car. Mohammed H. got out of the car to ask why the soldiers had hit his car when he was complying with their orders, and a soldier came to his car and broke his mirror with his gun. At that time, an Israeli settler stopped on the bypass road, began cursing Mohammed H., and threw a rock at the car. The IDF soldiers politely escorted the settler to his car and asked him to leave the scene before allowing Mohammed H. to leave. Mohammed H. showed Human Rights Watch photos of his damaged car, which were consistent with his story.  On February 15, Mohammed H. was again victimized by IDF soldiers. As he was traveling from Hebron to Yatta on the main bypass at 5 a.m. to pick up a passenger, IDF soldiers stopped him near the Zief junction and demanded his ID and keys, explaining that it was a closure and that he was not allowed to drive on the road because there had been heavy shooting near the settlement of Ma'on. The soldiers slashed two of Mohammed H.'s tires before telling him """"If [the Palestinians] stop shooting at us [in Ma'on], you can travel on this road."""" Mohammed H. stayed with his car until 6 p.m., 13 hours after he had been stopped, before his keys and ID were returned to him.  Ali M., a thirty-one year old official in the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, was driving on the road between Beit Umar and the Al Arrub refugee camp at about 10 a.m. on February 8, on his way to visit his parents. An IDF jeep suddenly passed him and cut him off, forcing him to stop. After complying with orders to get out of the car and hand over his keys, a soldier pushed Ali M. hard against his car with his machinegun. The soldiers told Ali M. the road was closed, and then one soldier shot out his rear tire while another pulled out a knife and cut through a front tire before leaving the car.  On December 18, Ali M. was about to cross the main bypass road (Route 60) to get from Hebron to his home village when IDF soldiers in two military jeeps stopped him and other drivers. The soldiers immediately started beating the crowd of Palestinian travelers:  They were swearing, calling us names, sons of bitches, dirty Arabs, bad stuff. I was standing outside the car with many other people. They just started hitting and pushing us, swearing at us. They were just walking around hitting people because we were not supposed to be there and were trying to get around them, and now we were caught.  A little boy threw a rock at them and hit a soldier in his leg. The soldier was so mad and started beating the boy bloody, he was swearing to God and cursing Mohammed, saying he would f*ck our prophet. The kid had a bloody nose and lips. Then he went to the first taxi driver and blew out his four tires, [the taxi driver] was from our village. Then he shot out one of my tires in the Landrover [The soldiers] took two men with them. When I reached home, I found out that my front lights had been broken. I didn't see this happen, I was too focused on saving myself and [my young brother-in-law] Arafat.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

In a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin, the international monitoring organization called on the Russian government to make public all available information about the grave, to allow relatives of missing persons to search for their loved ones among the bodies, and to ask the Council of Europe to provide a team of forensic medical experts to participate in the investigation. Human Rights Watch also wrote to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe urging the organization to offer its assistance investigating the grave.  On February 24, local residents discovered a mass grave-possibly containing as many as 200 dead bodies-in an abandoned village in the vicinity of the Khankala military base. According to press reports, after news of the grave became known, a Grozny man found among the corpses his sixteen-year-old son, who had been missing since December 2000. He also found the body of the young man with whom his son had gone missing. Russian law enforcement agents have apparently sealed off the area to prevent people from looking for missing relatives.  """"We have established a clear pattern of cases when people 'disappear' in the custody of Russian troops,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"So the discovery of this mass grave is very alarming."""" The mass grave discovered near Khankala is not the first unmarked grave to be found in Chechnya. Throughout the past six months, unmarked graves containing the bodies of people who had previously """"disappeared"""" in the custody of Russian troops were found in several villages, including Starye Atagi, Dzhalka, Gekhi, Duba-Yurt and Mesker-Yurt. Many of the bodies had been severely mutilated. Injuries commonly found on these bodies included broken limbs, scalped body parts, cut off fingertips, knife and gunshot wounds.  Human Rights Watch and Memorial, a leading Russian human rights group, have recently documented more than fifty cases in which relatives or others witnessed Russian forces detaining individuals, but were unable to obtain any further information about their whereabouts. In most cases, law enforcement agencies flatly denied that the detention had ever taken place. [Human Rights Watch issued a field update on abuses in Chechnya on January 22, 2001 with further information on this trend.]  In one case, the parents of three young men managed to receive confirmation that their sons had been taken to the Khankala military base. After Islam Dombaev (15), Murad Lianov (17), and Timor Tabzhanov (18) were detained on June 28, 2000 in Grozny, local Chechen police informed the parents that Ministry of Interior forces had detained the three and taken them to Khankala. Parents' inquiries at the base have yielded no result. The head of the unit that detained the three refused to appear for questioning at the Grozny procuracy.

In thousands of cases, sexual violence has been followed by the abduction of women and girls and forced bondage to male combatants in slavery-like conditions often accompanied by forced labor. These sexual crimes are most often characterized by extraordinary brutality and are frequently preceded or followed by violent acts against other family members. The rebel factions use sexual violence as a weapon to terrorize, humiliate, punish and ultimately control the civilian population into submission.   The perpetration of sexual violence is often marked by the systematic breaking of taboos and undermining of cultural values. For example, Human Rights Watch has documented cases of fathers being forced to watch the rape of their daughters, middle-aged women being raped by boys as young as eleven, women being raped in public places, and girls being raped during sacred coming-of-age rituals. As in other countries, the abuse of women in the Sierra Leonean conflict is rooted in the persistent human rights violations that push women into a lower status with limited rights in all spheres of their lives, from home to work.   The violence has affected thousands of girls and women of all ages. While members of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) and Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC; the renegade members of the Sierra Leonean Army who led the 1997 coup, now sometimes also known as the West Side Boys) have been the most common perpetrators, members of the civil defense forces - the biggest and most powerful of which is the Kamajors - and the loyal Sierra Leonean Army have also been implicated.   Following the 1999 Lomé Peace Accord, there was a marked decrease in most human rights violations - except sexual violence, which continued unabated. From the signing in July 1999 to the May 2000 collapse of the accord, Human Rights Watch documented some one hundred cases of rape by rebel forces. Since the collapse of the peace agreement in May 2000, Human Rights Watch has received consistent reports of rape by RUF rebels and AFRC soldiers, and to a lesser extent by Kamajor militias.   There are no official statistics on the numbers of girls and women who have suffered sexual violence during the war. This is due both to under-reporting because of cultural factors, fear of retaliation, and lack of faith in the criminal justice system, and to a lack of resources devoted to the problem on the part of the relevant government ministries. While it is common that women know the perpetrators of these violations, very few have dared to bring charges, for fear of reprisals against them and their families. However, those girls who have either been released or managed to escape rebel captivity indicate that the overwhelming majority are sexually abused. According to one 1999 study, there were 1,862 female victims of sexual abuse seen for medical treatment and counseling in one program treating victims raped and/or abducted during the January 1999 offensive against the capital Freetown. Of these, according to information received from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) in March 2000, 55 percent reported having been gang raped and 200 had become pregnant.   Since April 1999, the Human Rights Watch office in Freetown has done extensive research on sexual violence and taken hundreds of testimonies of victims throughout the rebel war and from all areas of the country.  International Law   Sexual violence within the Sierra Leonean conflict is not only a war crime, but - given its widespread and systematic nature - is also a crime against humanity. Rape and other forms of sexual violence also constitute torture when they are intentionally inflicted on a victim by an official or with official instigation, consent or tolerance for purposes such as intimidation, punishment, or eliciting information. Grave breaches of the laws of war, torture, and crimes against humanity are crimes of universal jurisdiction: any nation may prosecute the perpetrators, regardless of their nationality, the nationality of victims or of where the crime took place. However, it is not necessary to find that rape and sexual violence take place systematically or on a wide scale in order to prosecute the perpetrators under national law. Just as a single case of murder of a civilian can be prosecuted, so too can a single rape.   Victims interviewed by Human Rights Watch indicate that the violence is often premeditated and organized, suggesting command responsibility on the part of the military hierarchy. That is to say, officers have either authorized or ordered these abuses, or they knew or should have known that they were taking place, and took no measures to control their subordinates. An individual found to have command responsibility for the crime committed by a subordinate is deemed responsible at least of the same crime as the subordinate, that is, if the officer stood by while the subordinate committed rape, the officer is also responsible for rape.  Perpetrators   Rebel Forces   The rebels (at different times the RUF, AFRC, and West Side Boys) have perpetrated systematic, organized and widespread sexual violence against girls and women since the Sierra Leonean civil war began in 1991. Most of the rapes documented by Human Rights Watch occurred during attacks against a hamlet, village or town. During the course of the attack, the victims were most often abducted and forced to become sexual partners or """"wives"""" to their rebel captors. Once captured, victims often described trying to attach themselves to one rebel so as to avoid gang rape, be given a degree of protection and be subjected to less hardship. They often become pregnant, had children and remained with the rebels for years. Some received military training, were given drugs and later themselves became perpetrators of serious abuses. Human Rights Watch has documented several cases of female rebels being involved in """"finding"""" and later abducting young girls to be later raped by their commanding officers.   The RUF has made occasional efforts to declare rape a crime within areas under their control, and discipline combatants accused of """"breaking the law."""" Human Rights Watch has documented numerous cases of combatants being publicly executed after summary trials in which they have been """"convicted"""" of rape. Human Rights Watch condemns such extra-judicial and summary proceedings and executions. These efforts have in any event failed to deter the perpetration of sexual violence by rebel soldiers in practice.   Civil Defense Forces   Rape has until recently been very uncommon among the CDF forces, the largest of which is the Kamajors, primarily because of the belief that power and potency as a warrior is dependent upon sexual abstinence. In the last few years the Kamajors have been moved away from their native areas and traditional chiefs, and given more responsibility in national security. Once separated from the influence of the paramount and regional chiefs, they have become increasingly undisciplined and the cases of rape have become more common. Human Rights Watch has also documented one case of the sexual torture to death of a female RUF commander by a senior Kamajor leader.   ECOMOG and UNAMSIL   Human Rights Watch has not documented any cases of rape by soldiers serving under ECOMOG, the Economic Community of West African States peace keeping force, or under UNAMSIL, the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone. The UNAMSIL human rights section provides basic training in international humanitarian law to the officers of all units serving in the mission.  Consequences of Sexual Violence   The victims of sexual violence can suffer severe health consequences. Human Rights Watch has interviewed two women who suffered a prolapsed uterus following rape, as well as several cases of serious injury among women who have had objects inserted into their vaginas. The incidence of sexually transmitted diseases is very high among the victims of sexual violence. The incidence of HIV/AIDS in rape victims is currently unknown but of great concern given rising rates of infection generally. There are effectively no programs available to test for infection. Girls as young as twelve have fallen pregnant as a result of rape.   According to health practitioners, victims of sexual violence often suffer anxiety and depression which lasts for years. Sierra Leonean society attaches a strong stigma to rape, and women are commonly blamed for having been raped or sexually assaulted. Many women who had been abducted interviewed by Human Rights Watch told how they stayed with the rebels for fear of being rejected by their family. This was particularly the case for those who had become pregnant and later had a child.  Care for Victims   Until the rebel offensive against the capital Freetown there were no statistics kept and no programs - either governmental or nongovernmental - specifically designed to treat the victims of sexual assault. The January 1999 offensive, in which thousands of girls and women were raped and later abducted by rebel forces, provoked a response on the part of such organizations as Médecins Sans Frontières, Forum for African Women Educationalists (FAWE), Cooperazione Internazionale (COOPI), and UNICEF.   During 1999, a task force on sexual violence was set up, and several counseling centers and a network of medical practitioners to treat the victims were established. MSF embarked on a program to train trauma counselors and COOPI opened a home in Freetown for abducted girls who had become pregnant. The services within the provinces, however, remain sorely lacking. The only existing program outside of Freetown is run by the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and treats victims living around the provincial headquarters of Bo and Kenema.  Protection of Civilians in Sierra Leone Today   The U.N. and its member states have failed to demonstrate the commitment to the implementation of the Lomé peace accord that is implied by the U.N.'s acceptance of the position of """"moral guarantor"""" of the agreement. It took three-and-a-half months after the signing of the Lomé accord for the Security Council to adopt a resolution creating a peacekeeping force, and further months for the soldiers authorized under that resolution actually to arrive in Sierra Leone; only after the crisis caused by the RUF taking U.N. soldiers hostage in May did UNAMSIL's military contingent reach the level of 11,100 authorized in February. Moreover, the mandate granted to the peacekeeping force was too limited for the conditions facing it, while the troops that have been deployed have failed to implement even that limited mandate. When UNAMSIL forces have come under RUF attack since the resumption of hostilities, they have frequently chosen to make an immediate retreat rather than attempting to maintain their positions. UNAMSIL and government forces, including the loyal Sierra Leonean Army and the Sierra Leone Police, are in control of less than half of the country.   In particular, very little effort has been made by the Sierra Leonean Army, Sierra Leonean Police and UNAMSIL to protect women and girls from attack by rebel groups. For example, in the months following the signing of the Lomé accord, Human Rights Watch documented scores of abductions and rapes of girls and women by AFRC and RUF rebels within villages around the western towns of Masiaka and Port Loko. The attacks occurred within the context of food raids and against public transport vehicles along a major highway. While the rebel activities were well known by UNAMSIL, ECOMOG (prior to their withdrawal), Sierra Leonean Police and the Sierra Leonean Army, there was no effort to arrest and prosecute the perpetrators. Several women were in fact abducted less than a mile from UNAMSIL and SLA checkpoints.   The UNAMSIL human rights section is currently providing human rights education to Sierra Leonean Police units. The British army is training 3,000 members of the Sierra Leonean Army, and includes education on the laws of armed conflict and child protection within their training curriculum. There is, however, no specific training to any military or police force with regard to women's rights, including women's rights to equality and bodily integrity.  Impunity   Article IX of the Lomé Accord required the government of Sierra Leone to """"grant absolute and free pardon and reprieve to all combatants and collaborators in respect of anything done by them in pursuit of their objectives"""" up to the date of the signing of the accord. The special representative of the U.N. secretary-general attached a reservation to the Lomé Accord stating that the U.N. interpreted Article IX not to apply to """"international crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and other serious violations of international humanitarian law."""" All states have a duty to prosecute the perpetrators of serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, including sexual violence. Human Rights Watch does not believe that, even under the terms of the Lomé amnesty as currently in force under Sierra Leonean law, rape and sexual violence should be considered as being """"in pursuit of the objectives"""" of any of the parties to the conflict.  Recommendations   Human Rights Watch urges all Sierra Leonean authorities and UNAMSIL to take steps to protect women from sexual violence, address the legal and other needs of victims, and bring perpetrators to justice. In particular, Human Rights Watch urges UNAMSIL to ensure that its monitoring of human rights abuses includes reporting on current incidents of rape and sexual assault against women and abduction of women for forced labor by rebel or pro-government forces, or by soldiers serving with the UNAMSIL peacekeeping forces. UNAMSIL should work with the Sierra Leonean government to put in place disciplinary and other procedures to prevent violations of international humanitarian law and other abuses, including sexual violence, by pro-government forces including the Sierra Leonean Army and the Civil Defense Forces.   Given the widespread nature of sexual abuse within the Sierra Leonean conflict, Human Rights Watch urges UNAMSIL, and the Commonwealth training teams involved in training UNAMSIL peacekeepers, the Sierra Leonean Army and Police, to include classes within their training to address women's rights, including women's rights to equality and bodily integrity, with special emphasis on sexual assault.   The Sierra Leonean Ministry of Health and international humanitarian organizations should make every effort to address health issues for women resulting from sexual violence. To the degree possible, programs for rape survivors should be integrated into broader programs to ensure that rape survivors are not further stigmatized.  Human Rights Watch has called for the establishment of an internationally-supported tribunal to bring to justice the perpetrators of war crimes and other abuses in Sierra Leone. Any such tribunal, or trials under Sierra Leonean law, should recognize and prosecute rape, sexual slavery and sexual mutilation, where appropriate, as crimes against humanity or war crimes.

The importance of this law is underscored by the unfolding developments in Belgrade and throughout the region. Human Rights Watch calls on the Bush administration to adhere strictly to the conditions of the legislation and to communicate this position unequivocally to the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY). Among the specific requirements for ongoing assistance is cooperation by Yugoslavia with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Cooperation is defined as including """"access for investigators, the provision of documents, and the surrender and transfer of indictees or assistance on their apprehension."""" [emphasis added] The law is clear and unequivocal and leaves no room for creative interpretation: to enjoy continued U.S. assistance, FRY authorities must apprehend and transfer indictees to the ICTY. With broad bipartisan support, Congress enacted this measure to ensure full cooperation as opposed to occasional incremental gestures.     In addition to former President Slobodan Milosevic, the former Chief of the Yugoslav Army's General Staff, Colonel General Dragoljub Ojdanic, the former Serbian Minister of the Interior, Vlajko Stojiljkovic, current Serb President Milan Milutinovic, and former FRY Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic were indicted for crimes against humanity committed by Yugoslav and Serbian troops under their command in Kosovo in early 1999. During that period Yugoslav and Serbian forces conducted a brutal """"ethnic cleansing"""" campaign in which thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed and more than 800,000 were forced out of the province. On many occasions, groups of Albanians were systematically executed by Serbian special police or paramilitaries. Human rights investigators, including Human Rights Watch, documented scores of cases of rape and sexual violence committed against ethnic Albanian women by Serb police, paramilitaries, and, in some cases, Yugoslav soldiers.     In addition to those indicted for crimes against humanity in Kosovo, three officers from the Yugoslav Army-Mile Mrksic, Mirolsav Radic, and Veselin Sljivancanin, who have been indicted on charges related to the capture of Vukovar in November 1991-remain at liberty in Yugoslavia. Sljivancanin is still serving as an officer in Yugoslavia's army. Moreover, former Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic (a Yugoslav citizen) is living in Belgrade. Radovan Karadzic, formerly the President of the Bosnian Serb Republic, is also at large and believed to have traveled to FRY in recent months. The longstanding impunity enjoyed by all these indicted criminals serves to embolden those in Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, and Croatia who harbor an extreme nationalist vision and pursue incendiary policies to serve it. The failure to hold them to account undermines the efforts of moderate leaders to promote reconciliation and integration with Europe, as well as political and economic reform.     To date, President Kostunica has made no effort to assist in apprehending or transferring the indictees at large in FRY to the custody of the ICTY. In fact, to justify his lack of cooperation he has repeatedly criticized the fairness of the ICTY. As recently as January 23, at a meeting with the ICTY's Chief Prosecutor, the President denigrated the Tribunal for dispensing """"selective justice"""" and """"laying collective guilt on one people"""" by supposedly singling out Serbian defendants. President Kostunica's public statements fly in the face of the views of those senior officials in the FRY and Serbian governments who are recommending the apprehension and transfer of all indictees.     In his efforts to oppose cooperation with the Tribunal, President Kostunica has argued that arresting Milosevic and the other indictees will """"destabilize"""" Yugoslavia and its new government. In fact, experience in the region demonstrates that the way to solidify the transition to a form of government that respects human rights is to apply the rule of law there. As the recent attempted kidnapping of the new Serbian Minister of Interior and the shots fired at the driver of the new head of Serbian State Security suggest, allowing Milosevic, the former Serbian Minister of the Interior, and the others to remain at liberty is encouraging the most violent and lawless elements in Serbia and weakening prospects for a lasting transition in FRY.     While President Kostunica's government has taken a restrained approach to the escalating violence and attacks on Serbs in the Presevo Valley, we are convinced that anything other than the strictest enforcement of U.S. conditions of cooperation with the ICTY as part of an implied quid pro quo will encourage an increase in violence there. Experience in the former Yugoslavia confirms that limiting escalating ethnic violence requires the fair, impartial and prompt application of the rule of law to all parties. The failure of the government in Belgrade to bring Slobodan Milosevic and the other indictees to justice before the ICTY can only serve to undermine confidence in the process of international justice and embolden the most violent actors in Kosovo and the Presevo Valley.     Any accommodation of the FRY government's failure to cooperate with the ICTY threatens not only the Yugoslav transition, but also those underway in Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina. The perception of a double standard for justice will strengthen the extremist elements throughout the region. Until it is made very clear that the U.S. and its allies will insist on the same standards of international justice throughout the region, hard core resistance to all aspects of the peace process will continue.     In that light, the effort by Serbian authorities to arrest Milosevic on domestic corruption charges can neither satisfy U.S. law nor the interests of peace and stability in the region. Domestic corruption proceedings in Belgrade, whatever their merits, cannot supersede Yugoslavia's obligation, under U.N. Security Council resolutions, as well as the Dayton Accords, to cooperate fully with the ICTY. Section 594 specifically requires satisfaction of this obligation, without reference to any alternative process of accountability. Moreover, domestic charges against Milosevic do not address the apprehension of the other indictees.     Crimes against humanity are a matter of concern to the victims as well as the international community as a whole. The scope and gravity of these acts give their prosecution precedence over corruption charges in Belgrade. The ICTY will try the indictees according to the highest standards of international justice that safeguard the rights of the accused. This will provide the victims a remedy under law. The ICTY was established because the courts of the former Yugoslavia lacked the independence and impartiality to try those accused of the most serious crimes. While we welcome the recent reforms in FRY's judicial system, impartial justice and U.S. law require full cooperation with the ICTY. We urge you to convey this message clearly to the authorities in Belgrade.     Some in Belgrade have argued that there is no statutory authority to transfer the indictees of Yugoslav nationality to the ICTY's custody. Nevertheless, President Kostunica can and should clearly signal his support for their apprehension. The arrest warrant issued by the ICTY for the indictees allows for their immediate arrest. The accused can be held by the national authorities until the necessary legislative changes have been made for their transfer to the custody of the Tribunal. The completion of the necessary legislative revisions must be treated as a priority matter. Moreover, any legal issues complicating the transfer of FRY citizens would not bar the immediate apprehension and transfer of those indictees who are non-citizens but nonetheless continue to enjoy impunity in FRY territory.     In light of the foregoing, we urge you to insist upon full and complete satisfaction of the conditions for U.S. assistance set forth in Section 594. We believe that as the law suggests, the U.S. should insist on these same conditions for its support of FRY at the international financial institutions. Equivocation here will severely damage the U.S. Government's credibility to speak forcefully on behalf of justice and undercut respect for the rule of law everywhere in the world, but particularly in the Balkans, where the U.S. has already invested so much.     Sincerely,     /s/     Holly Cartner   Executive Director   Europe and Central Asia Division   Human Rights Watch","Europe/Central Asia, United States, Serbia/Kosovo","International Justice"

The decision was announced today in the Hague. The three received sentences of twenty-eight, twenty, and twelve years respectively.     """"This decision is historic because it puts those who rape and sexually enslave women on notice that they will not get away with these heinous crimes,"""" said Regan Ralph, Director of the Women's Rights Division. """"Finally, the international community is taking these sexual crimes -- rapes, gang rapes, and sexual enslavement of women -- seriously."""" Human Rights Watch described the systematic rapes in Foca in a report published in 1998, A Dark and Closed Place.     These cases marked the first time in history that an international tribunal brought charges solely for crimes of sexual violence against women. The decision also marked the first time that the ICTY found rape and enslavement as crimes against humanity. The eight-month long trial included testimony of sixty-three witnesses, including sixteen victims of rape held for months in sexual slavery and subjected to multiple gang rapes by the defendants and others. The Tribunal found that the defendants had enslaved six of the women. Most importantly, although two of the women were sold as chattel by Radomir Kovac for 500 Deutsch Marks each, the Tribunal found that enslavement of the women did not necessarily require the buying or selling of a human being.     """"This decision sets a legal standard for sexual enslavement as a crime against humanity. This interpretation will serve as the basis to prosecute others who enslave women around the world,"""" said Ralph.     The Tribunal also held that Kunarac, a commander of a special unit of the Bosnian Serb Army, did not have command responsibility for the rapes and sexual assaults committed by soldiers who were arguably under his command. The Tribunal found that the, """"prosecutor failed to show that the soldiers who committed the offenses charged in the indictment were under the effective control of Kunarac at the time they committed the offenses."""" Human Rights Watch is concerned about this failure to find command responsibility, but believes that the impact of the holding will be limited because of the unusual facts of this case.     Human Rights Watch also expressed concern about the failure to arrest other suspects indicted for rape and other crimes of sexual violence in the Foca case. Of the original eight Foca indictees, three (Dragan Zelenovic, Gojko Jankovic, and Radovan Stankovic) still remain at large.     """"To shatter the cycle of impunity for sexual violence, the international community must seek out and arrest those indicted for these crimes. It is intolerable for perpetrators of rape, torture, and sexual slavery to remain free. Failure to arrest also places those witnesses who courageously came forward to testify in the Foca case in serious danger of retaliation.""""""""     Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned that Bosnian Serb war-time leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic remain at large. They are indicted for crimes committed under their command, including abuses that took place in Foca. Karadzic is believed to be in Bosnia and Herzegovina, where both the authorities and NATO troops stationed there have failed to arrest him. Mladic is believed to be in Serbia, where the new Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica has resisted international calls for his government to abide by U.N. obligations to cooperate with the tribunal.     In general, the ad hoc tribunals still have a lackluster and inconsistent record on investigating and prosecuting crimes of sexual violence. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) continues to lack a comprehensive approach to the inclusion of sexual violence charges in its cases. Even in cases where the Office of the Prosecutor (OTP) has witness testimony or evidence of sexual violence, as in the Cyangugu trial and the """"media"""" trial, the OTP has failed to include these charges in the original indictments or to seek amendments to prosecute these crimes against women.     """"The prosecutors at the ICTR continue to treat rape and sexual violence as an afterthought, adding rape charges as amendments -- or not bothering to bring them at all, even when there is evidence,"""" explained Ralph. """"This sends a terrible message that those who commit crimes against women in other conflicts in Africa will get away with it.""""     Human Rights Watch also expressed concern at the failure to bring indictments for rapes committed in Kosovo in 1999. """"Nearly two years after the conflict in Kosovo, the Prosecutor has still not brought charges for rape and other crimes of sexual violence committed in Kosovo. The women who suffered sexual violence at the hands of Serbian police, soldiers, and paramilitaries are still waiting for justice.""""","Europe/Central Asia, Bosnia and Herzegovina","International Justice, Women's Rights, Sexual Violence and Rape"

At the just-concluded Asia regional preparatory meeting held in Tehran on February 19-21 for the upcoming World Conference Against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, the Indian government tried to block members of the Dalit (""""untouchable"""") community from getting descent-based discrimination on the agenda of the conference. The World Conference is to be held in South Africa from August 31 through September 7. """"We find it odd that the largest democracy in the world should try to stop discussion of a serious human rights abuse that affects 240 million people in Asia,"""" said Smita Narula, Human Rights Watch's senior researcher for South Asia and participant at the Tehran meeting.  The Indian government argued that to discuss caste was to """"dilute"""" the conference's focus on racism. But under the major international treaty on the subject to which India is a party, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, """"racial discrimination"""" very clearly applies to any """"distinction, exclusion or restriction"""" based on """"descent"""" -- as well as on race, color, or national or ethnic origin. """"This is simply a question of Indian officials not wanting to admit having serious international human rights problems at home,"""" said Narula. """"But Dalit representatives at the conference argued that precisely because the issue has been sidelined, silenced and ignored in India and Nepal, they need international attention and support."""" The World Conference in South Africa, she said, was the ideal place to expose what many have come to see as South Asia's """"hidden apartheid."""" In several South Asian countries, Dalits may not cross the line dividing their part of the village from that occupied by higher castes. They may not use the same wells, visit the same temples and churches, drink from the same cups in tea stalls, or lay claim to land that is legally theirs. Dalit children are frequently made to sit in the back of classrooms, and communities as a whole are made to perform degrading rituals in the name of caste. Dalit women are frequent victims of sexual abuse. Dalits are routinely abused, even killed, at the hands of upper castes that enjoy the state's protection. The Indian government also drew fire from NGO representatives by trying to stop discussion of caste at an NGO meeting that took place before the official government preparatory meeting opened. According to participants, the government sent an Indian member of parliament and a member of the legislative assembly, as well as several other people who had clearly received a government brief, to attend the the NGO meeting and argue the government's side.","Asia, India",""

Half the countries in Africa now have such commissions, while only one country (Togo) did in 1989. However, many of the commissions appear designed to deflect international criticism of human rights abuses rather than to address the abuses themselves. The commissions in Ghana, South Africa and Uganda, however, are exceptions to the general trend. International donors and the United Nations are actively encouraging the creation of these new state institutions. But after providing initial expertise and funding, these donors often do not follow through to make sure government human rights commissions actually do something to protect victims and combat human rights abuse, Human Rights Watch said. """"African governments are jumping on the human rights bandwagon, but they don't seem truly interested in helping victims,"""" said Peter Takirambudde, Executive Director of the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Many of these government human rights commissions are weak. The U.N. and international funders must not give legitimacy to commissions that serve merely as window dressing."""" The performance of these commissions varies considerably from country to country. Most were formed by governments with poor human rights records and weak state institutions generally, and many commissions are under-funded, according to the report. The 407-page report, """"Protectors or Pretenders?"""" examined Africa's twenty-two commissions over a two-year period. The most significant factor, according to Human Rights Watch, is the courage and integrity of commission members. Many commissioners fail to publicly denounce abuses, either from fear of retribution, or out of hope of government favor. This is the case in Cameroon, Chad, Kenya, Liberia, and Sudan. In some places, such as Algeria, Togo, and Tunisia, commissioners downplay their government's abuses. Others are careful to avoid comment on politically sensitive violations, as in Nigeria under military rule. And several have yet to fully establish themselves due to legislative problems, delays in appointing staff, or lack of funding. """"Millions of Africans are being displaced, tortured, or killed,"""" said Binaifer Nowrojee, primary author of the report and counsel with the Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Yet the sad truth is that human rights commissioners in Africa often turn a blind eye to these abuses."""" Human Rights Watch acknowledged the potential of government human rights commissions to put a stop to state abuses, get remedies for victims, and support local human rights activists under attack for their work. The report praised the Ghanaian, South African, and Ugandan commissioners who have not been afraid to speak out strongly when confronted with government abuses. The report said the Malawian and Senegalese commissions show early promise. In Zambia, too, despite serious limitations placed by the government, the commission has increasingly shown itself to be serious.","Africa",""

Human Rights Watch also deplored Palestinian shooting at Israeli settlements, and called on the Palestinian Authority to take measures to prevent armed attacks on Israeli civilians.  """"Israeli forces are causing civilian deaths by firing indiscriminately into Hebron's Palestinian neighborhoods,"""" said Joe Stork, Washington Director of the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"The Israeli military is obligated to protect Palestinian civilians from heavy fire, and should take the necessary steps to halt this pattern of indiscriminate and excessive fire.""""  Hebron has been the scene of regular heavy fire exchanges between Palestinian gunmen and the Israeli military. Palestinian gunmen have used light automatic weapons to fire on Israeli Defense Force's (IDF) positions and civilian Israeli settlements located in the Israeli-controlled center of the city. The IDF has responded with heavy fire from medium-caliber machine guns and rockets directed into Palestinian neighborhoods, causing deaths, serious injuries and extensive damage. On the night of February 17, 2001, the IDF responded to Palestinian gunfire by targeting the Abu Snainah neighborhood of Hebron and a Palestinian collective farm located on the outskirts of Hebron, causing three Palestinian civilian deaths and wounding at least five. The IDF fire killed twenty-nine year old Issam al-Tawil as he was driving home with his parents, his brother and his sister-in-law. IDF fire on the al-Rayyan collective farm hit three of the four workers present at the facility, killing Shaker al-Manasra and gravely injuring Yusuf al-Manasra and Ahmad Farajullah. Ahmad Farajullah later died of his wounds. The surviving workers and the manager of al-Rayyan collective farm denied that there had been any gunfire from the farm. Also hit during the IDF response was the luxury al-Mezan hotel, which was hosting two wedding parties with more than a thousand guests at the time. On February 18, 2001, IDF soldiers fired shots at the car of Rajik al-Qamari as he was driving nearby an IDF checkpoint, hitting his windshield with three bullets. Al-Qamari narrowly escaped injury. Human Rights Watch also deplored the actions of Palestinian gunmen in shooting at Israeli settlements. Although Israeli settlements are established contrary to international humanitarian law, they are not legitimate targets for military attack as they are inhabited by civilians, including children. Palestinian gunmen are also effectively putting Palestinian civilians at risk by shooting at settlements and IDF positions from heavily populated civilian areas.  """"This behavior is not acceptable and we reiterate our call to the Palestinian police to do more to prevent such shootings,"""" said Stork, """"but such Palestinian actions do not give Israel carte blanche to respond with heavy or indiscriminate fire into Palestinian neighborhoods, risking civilian lives."""" No Israeli settler has been killed in the Hebron district by Palestinian gunfire aimed at the settlements, although at least two settlers have died in Palestinian road attacks attributed to Hamas in the area. A Fatah member in Hebron recently told Human Rights Watch that local Fatah leaders regularly instruct Fatah gunmen to shoot at Israeli settlements. During a visit to the downtown Hebron settlements in November 2000, Human Rights Watch researchers learned of one Israeli settler injured in connection with Palestinian gunfire, a pregnant woman injured in a car crash while fleeing shooting at the Tel Rumeida settlement. However, homes in the settlements visited by Human Rights Watch in Hebron had been hit by gunfire. Although physical damage caused by Palestinian automatic weapons was generally light, settlers told Human Rights Watch that they had to relocate their sleeping arrangements into crowded safer rooms, and said that their children were unable to sleep and were constantly fearful.  The following partial list of incidents recently documented by Human Rights Watch in Hebron in which Palestinian civilians were killed or severely injured indicates a serious and persistent indiscriminate use of deadly force by the IDF. On January 5, IDF fire from the Beit Haggai settlement hit eighteen-year-old Ahlam al-Jabali and her eighteen-year-old sister-in-law, Arij al-Jabali, as the two were seeking shelter in the stairwell of their home. A single bullet penetrated the body of Arij al-Jabali, who was killed in the incident, and lodged in the body of Ahlam al-Jabali, who recovered. According to the family, the IDF was responding to fireworks fired at Beit Haggai from the family's neighborhood. Arij al-Jabali was expecting to get engaged on the day of her death. On January 2, IDF gunfire wounded thirty-year-old Samir Abu Shakhdam as he was walking home from work in a Palestinian area bordering on the Israeli-controlled Tel Rumeida settlement. Earlier in the day, two IDF soldiers guarding the Tel Rumeida settlement had been wounded by Palestinian gunfire. An ambulance which came to evacuate Abu Shakhdam evacuated another seven wounded civilians from the same neighborhood. On January 1, IDF soldiers shot and severely injured Jadallah al-Jabiri in the center of Hebron, nearly severing his foot. The IDF has admitted that its soldiers acted wrongly in the incident which was filmed by an Associated Press cameraman, and has apologized for the incident. On December 31, IDF fire into the Haret al-Sheikh neighborhood of Hebron injured eighteen-year-old Arit al-Qawasma in her bedroom, injuring her in the right shoulder and face. As she was being evacuated from the house, renewed IDF fire killed eleven-year-old Muath Abu Hadwan, who had come to watch the evacuation, and wounded another boy. During the same period, IDF fire injured thirteen-year-old Abir Salameh as she went to feed her chickens on the roof of her house, injuring her in the stomach. On November 16, IDF soldiers fatally shot thirty-one-year-old Yusuf Abu Awad near a checkpoint in Beit Umar. According to eyewitnesses, soldiers asked Abu Awad to stop at the checkpoint, and then began throwing stones at his car. When Abu Awad protested the stone throwing, a soldier came up to him and pointed his gun at his chest. Abu Awad attempted to push the gun away from his chest, and was shot in the face by the soldier. The IDF is reportedly investigating the killing. At about 4 p.m. on November 11, IDF fire from the Shalala street position fired on Munib Abu Munshar as he was unloading building materials from his truck, killing him instantly. There were no clashes taking place at the time, although Palestinian youth had clashed with IDF soldiers at the position earlier in the day. On October 23, 2000, IDF fire killed fifty-seven-year-old Abdul Aziz Abu Snainah as he went to his front room to answer a phone call during a period of heavy IDF fire. The IDF shot at Abu Snainah's brother in the street as he tried to come to the assistance of his brother. Human Rights Watch researchers counted more than sixty medium caliber bullet scars on the home, as well as dozens of impact craters on nearby homes and the street. On October 18, IDF soldiers positioned in the Beit Haggai settlement shot thirty-eight-year-old Ibrahim Abu Turki as he rode his donkey from his home village of Kilkas past the settlement. Abu Turki remains in critical condition and was paralyzed by the gunshot wound. At about 10 p.m. on October 13, IDF soldiers shot twenty-two-year-old Shadi al-Wawi, a university student, as he was sitting on the roof of his relative's home in the al-Fawar refugee camp. Palestinian youth were clashing with IDF soldiers located about 150 meters away from the home, but al-Wawi and his family did not participate in the violence. IDF soldiers fired several shots at the family as they tried to rescue al-Wawi, and threatened a medical team which tried to reach al-Wawi. An ambulance was forced to take an alternative route, taking over one hour to reach the hospital. Al-Wawi died on route to the hospital. On October 9, 2000, IDF fire severely injured twenty-eight-year-old Shihab Sharif as he was walking home in the Bab al-Zawiah neighborhood after visiting a cousin at about 10:15 p.m. Sherif was hit by bullets in his left side, his back, and his right elbow. On the same day, IDF fire on the Haret al-Sheikh neighborhood injured twenty-eight year old Fatina Fakhoury, a mother of four, in the face, and a bullet fragment also hit her seven-day-old baby in her arms.","Middle East/North Africa, Israel/Palestine",""

Habré was indicted last February, but in July an appeals court dismissed the charges, arguing that Senegal had no jurisdiction over crimes allegedly committed in Chad. In arguments today before the Cour de Cassation, Senegal's highest court, the state prosecutor, Aly Ciré Ba, argued that the charges should be re-instated. This turn-around in the prosecution's position was applauded by advocates for the victims. """"We're delighted the prosecution has taken the position that Senegal must try these crimes,"""" said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, one of the organizations that initiated the case. """"Today you can't commit atrocities in one country and then claim sanctuary next door."""" Lawyers for Habré and for the victims who brought the case, as well as the state prosecutor, presented their arguments in a five-hour hearing before the three-judge Criminal Chamber of the Cour de Cassation. The victims' lawyers, Boucounta Diallo and Sidiki Kaba, noted that the """"no safe haven"""" provision of the 1984 United Nations Convention against Torture, which Senegal ratified in 1986, expressly obliges states to either prosecute or extradite alleged torturers who enter its territory. Under the Senegalese constitution, international treaties, once ratified, override Senegal's legal code. The victims' position was supported by the state prosecutor. Habré's lawyers, Madické Niang and Helène Cissé, argued that Senegal had no jurisdiction over crimes committed in Chad. Court President Mireille Ndiaye announced that a decision would be rendered on March 6. In February 2000, Judge Demba Kandji of the Dakar Regional Court indicted Habré on torture charges, and placed him under house arrest. It was the first time that an African had been charged with atrocities by the court of another African country. On July 4, 2000, following Judge Kandji's removal from the case, the Court of Appeals dismissed the charges against Habré, ruling that Senegal had not enacted legislation to implement the Convention against Torture and therefore had no jurisdiction to pursue the charges because the crimes were not committed in Senegal. The dismissal drew protests from the United Nations, Senegal's association of judges, the New York Times and rights activists around the world. Habré, 57, took power in Chad in 1982, overthrowing the government of Goukouni Wedeye.

The prison uprising began Sunday in Carandiru, Latin America's largest prison complex, and quickly spread to twenty-eight other prisons in the state of S? Paulo, Brazil. By mid-day Monday, police had regained control of the prisons and freed large numbers of hostages, but only after fifteen inmates had been killed. According to an eyewitness account reported in the press, police who entered cellblock four of the Casa de Deten˜¬o (located within the Carandiru prison complex) shot three inmates in the back. """"The Brazilian authorities have a track record of failing to investigate and punish those responsible for prison killings,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division, referring to the 1992 massacre of 111 inmates at the Casa de Deten˜¬o. """"This cycle of impunity must end.""""  On October 2, 1992, after a riot at the Casa de Deten˜¬o of Carandiru, military police stormed the facility and killed 111 prisoners. After gaining control of the situation, they forced prisoners to strip naked and executed dozens of them, including many who were trying to hide under their beds. No police were injured by gunfire, undermining the official story that the police engaged in a """"shootout."""" The police commander (Col. Ubiratan Guimar?s) was later elected to the S? Paulo State Legislative Assembly. Nine years after the fact, not a single officer has been convicted of participation in the killings.  In April 2000, the Inter-American Commission condemned Brazil for the massacre, finding that the government had violated the prisoners' rights to life and bodily integrity. The commission specifically criticized the Brazilian authorities' failure to investigate, prosecute, and punish the police responsible for the killings.  As Human Rights Watch noted in its 1998 report on prison conditions in Brazil, the 1992 Carandiru massacre was just the bloodiest of a continuing series of brutal incidents in Brazil's prisons. The report documented a number of other instances of extrajudicial killings of inmates, as well as torture and other violent abuses.  The report, available on the web at Behind Bars in Brazil, also describes inhuman levels of overcrowding, abuse by guards, frequent and uncontrolled prisoner-on-prisoner violence, a lack of basic services, and a failure to treat serious diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. In the wake of the latest round of violence, the international monitoring organization urged state prison authorities to implement needed reforms to reduce overcrowding, improve detention conditions, and provide inmates with basic services.  Since Human Rights Watch released its report, prison populations in Brazil, and in S? Paulo in particular, have grown rapidly, and conditions have not improved. At present, the country incarcerates more than 200,000 people, nearly half of them in S? Paulo.","Americas, Brazil",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/02/19/afghanistan-taliban-massacres-detailed","Afghanistan- Taliban Massacres Detailed","Afghanistan: Taliban Massacres Detailed","","02/19/2001","(New York)-Human Rights Watch today released fresh eyewitness accounts of a massacre of hundreds of civilians by Taliban forces in Afghanistan last month. Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations to step up efforts to investigate the massacre, citing previous failures by the U.N. to hold Afghanistan's warring parties accountable for grave abuses. It was critical, Human Rights Watch said, that the investigation be conducted by a small, expert team as quickly as possible, before crucial evidence disappears. The new report, """"Massacres of Hazaras in Afghanistan,"""" gives detailed accounts of the January 2001 massacre in the central highlands of Afghanistan as well as new evidence related to an earlier massacre in May 2000. In both cases, the victims were primarily Hazaras, a Shia Muslim ethnic group that has been the target of previous abuses by Taliban forces. Afghan humanitarian aid workers were among those killed. """"The international focus on Afghanistan in recent months has been almost exclusively on the Taliban's reported support for terrorism abroad,"""" said Sidney Jones, Asia director of Human Rights Watch. """"The same energy should be directed to stopping the killings of civilians inside Afghanistan.""""  On February 16, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson called for the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry into human rights violations in Afghanistan. Human Rights Watch is concerned that such a commission would take too long to establish; the need is for a small team of experts that can be deployed immediately. """"A prompt and thorough investigation could deter further killings of Afghan civilians,"""" said Jones. """"The U.N. so far has failed to systematically document and pursue accountability for abuses in Afghanistan."""" The massacres documented in the report took place in the context of the six-year civil war between the Taliban and parties now grouped in the United National Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan. The killings were part of a pattern of efforts to intimidate minority populations and to deter them from cooperating with the United Front, Human Rights Watch said. The report quotes eyewitness accounts of the January 8-12, 2001 killings. According to those sources, Taliban forces retook the town of Yakaolang, in Bamiyan province, nine days after they had been driven out by two Shia-based parties in the United Front. After conducting search operations throughout the city and nearby villages, the Taliban detained about 300 civilian adult males, including staff members of humanitarian organizations. The men were herded to assembly points in the center of the district and several outlying areas, and then shot by firing squad in public view. The May 2000 massacre took place near the Robatak pass on the border between Baghlan and Samanagan provinces in north central Afghanistan. All of those killed had been detained for four months and many of them were tortured before they were killed. Human Rights Watch has obtained confirmation that thirty-one bodies were found at the site, of which twenty-six have been positively identified as civilians from Baghlan province. There are reported to be as many as three other grave sites scattered along the same road north of the pass toward the city of Mazar-i Sharif. Taliban forces were driven out of Yakaolang by the United Front on January 23, 2001. In a major setback to the Taliban, the United Front also captured Bamiyan city, the provincial capital, on the night of February 13-14. Taliban authorities had barred journalists from visiting the region, while denying that their forces had massacred civilians in Yakaolang.","Asia, Afghanistan",""

Many of the over 90,000 refugees are entering their tenth year of life in exile in Nepal, and the agreement by both the governments of Nepal and Bhutan to initiate a joint verification with a view to repatriation to Bhutan has brought the refugees a renewed sense of hope and optimism.   While we recognize the significant progress that has thus far been made, we nevertheless share some critical concerns about the process and procedures for the joint verification. These include the absence of an independent third party to monitor and oversee the verification and repatriation process; the lack of clarity regarding the documentation required for the verification; the absence of any independent appeal process; and provisions for refugees to be accompanied to their verification interview if necessary.     We understand that the Terms of Reference agreed to by both parties make no reference to an independent monitoring or referral body, and that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has not been given an active role in monitoring and facilitating the verification and repatriation process, as is the norm in most refugee situations worldwide.     We strongly urge the governments of Nepal and Bhutan to rethink their decision not to formally involve UNHCR and to request the agency to take a more formal role in monitoring and facilitating the verification, repatriation and reintegration process, possibly as part of a tripartite commission including both governments. This not only will give the process more credibility but it will ensure that the verification and repatriation conform to international standards. There are other reasons for involving UNHCR:     · The joint verification team could greatly benefit from UNHCR's expertise in screening for and implementing voluntary repatriation programs worldwide.   · UNHCR could serve as a referral point in the event of any disagreement or difficulty that arises during the verification   · UNHCR could play a critical role in the dissemination of information about the verification procedures and in general public awareness raising in the refugee camps.   · UNHCR has developed useful guidelines and standards for voluntary repatriation that both governments could follow, such as those contained in the 1996 UNHCR Handbook on Voluntary Repatriation as well as various Conclusions of UNHCR's Executive Committee (ExCom) in 1974, 1980, and 1985 respectively.     We would be grateful for clarification on several other aspects of the joint verification process. It is unclear what documentation the refugees are required to produce as proof of prior residence in and/ or citizenship of Bhutan. We urge both governments to clarify and make public the list of accepted documentation for verification to avoid confusion and uncertainty amongst the refugees.     We also hope that you will ensure that there is an opportunity for refugees to be accompanied to their verification interview by a family member or representative from a non-governmental organization working in the camps. This is particularly the case for vulnerable groups, such as unaccompanied minors, single women, the elderly, and the physically and mentally disabled.   Finally, we understand that the current Terms of Reference do not include any provisions for an independent appeal process for refugees who may wish to challenge the final decision of the verification.

Fox took office in December after a campaign in which he promised to promote the welfare of Mexicans who migrated north. His new foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, took the cause to Washington two weeks ago, announcing Mexico's intention to """"take a much more active role in the defense of human rights"""" and describing the treatment of migrants at the U.S. border as """"intolerable.""""  When Fox talks directly to Bush, he might be expected to recount the long history of abuses committed by the U.S. Border Patrol, which include beatings, sexual assaults and shootings of unarmed migrants. Fox also could criticize the U.S. for failing to provide adequate oversight for its Border Patrol agents, a criticism already voiced by staff members of the U.S. Office of the Inspector General, who say they lack the resources to investigate all the complaints they receive.  Fox could question the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service's efforts to block border crossings near population centers, a policy that has not stopped the flow of immigrants north but has prompted many to cross at remote and dangerous border areas. Forbidding terrain in these areas has led to more than 1,400 immigrant deaths from exposure since the mid-1990s. And the hostile reception of private land-holders has resulted in migrants being shot at and even killed by ranchers. Last May, for example, a rancher near Brackettville, Texas, shot a border-crosser who had asked him for water. The 23-year-old man bled to death. In December, the separatist group, Republic of Texas, announced plans to send armed patrols to the Texas border region to apprehend undocumented migrants. While the U.S. government can't be expected to regulate the desert heat, Fox could insist that it do more to rein in its unruly citizens.  Once the topic of human rights is opened, there are other issues as well. One problem that might be on the agenda is the abuse many Mexicans face in the American workplace. Migrant farm workers in particular are often denied a minimum wage and basic safety protections, and their efforts to unionize are easily discouraged by the threat of a call to the INS.  Mexico, of course, has its own human rights problems, inextricably linked to the two other major issues on the Bush-Fox agenda: trade and the war on drugs. Both presidents are committed to expanding free trade in the Americas. But the North American Free Trade Agreement side accord on labor rights has done little to curb widespread labor violations in Mexico. When, for example, U.S. officials found that Mexico's maquiladora factories routinely discriminated against pregnant women, the two governments reached an agreement to sponsor public """"outreach sessions."""" But this did little to actually end the practice. Mexican maquilas have continued to conduct illegal pregnancy testing.  As for drugs, Fox recently announced his government's intention to fight a """"war without quarter"""" against traffickers. But, without adequate safeguards, such an aggressive approach runs the risk of aggravating the human rights problems--arbitrary detention, torture and extrajudicial executions of alleged criminals-that already plague Mexico's criminal justice system. Also, the increasing involvement of the Mexican military in the drug war is likely to multiply the law enforcement abuses, in part because soldiers are trained for warfare more than policing and in part because they are not subject to prosecution in civilian courts.  It remains to be seen whether Fox is ready to tackle Mexico's human rights problems head on. One encouraging sign is his willingness to break with the Mexican government's long-standing practice of ignoring and silencing its critics. During his campaign, for instance, he promised to intervene in the case of a former general who was jailed for criticizing the military's human rights practices. And in December, he announced he would lift visa restrictions that made it more difficult for international organizations to monitor human rights practices throughout the country. Fox also says he is ready to talk to Mexico's most famous critic, Subcommander Marcos, the leader of the Zapatista rebels in Chiapas.  For the moment, however, the general remains in jail, visa restrictions for human rights groups still exist and peace negotiations in Chiapas have not been renewed. If Fox fulfills these promises, he will be in a better position to challenge Bush about human rights at future summits.","Americas, United States, Mexico",""

Herne Gabrielli Rojas, following credible allegations that he participated in the torture of political detainees following the September 1973 military coup. Human Rights Watch urged the Chilean government to make itself party to the case against Gabrielli. Three former political detainees, who had been held in the Cerro Moreno air base in the northern city of Antofagasta in the days immediately following the coup, recently made important allegations implicating Gabrielli in serious human rights crimes. According to their account, Gabrielli, then a lieutenant, was responsible for beating another detainee, Eugenio Ruiz-Tagle Orrego, and participating in a mock execution in which they were all victims. After suffering brutal torture, Ruiz-Tagle was executed on October 19, 1973, by a military death squad known as the """"Caravan of Death."""" """"These charges are extremely serious, and must be investigated thoroughly and impartially,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of Human Rights Watch´s Americas division. Vivanco said that a lawsuit against Gabrielli is being prepared by relatives of Ruiz-Tagle, and urged the government of Chile to make itself a party to the investigation. On February 7, the electronic newspaper El Mostrador released some hitherto unpublished documents indicating that former dictator Augusto Pinochet, now on trial for ordering the Caravan of Death executions, was informed of Ruiz-Tagle's execution. Pinochet reportedly tried to stall an official investigation by claiming that there were serious charges against Ruiz-Tagle and that he had not been tortured. Ruiz-Tagle's relatives cited a witness, Carlos Blau, an accountant, who allegedly saw Ruiz-Tagle being beaten by Gabrielli. That account was later confirmed by two other witnesses, Juan Ruz, currently an Education Ministry official, and Hector Vera, an academic. Human Rights Watch expressed grave concern at reports that General Gabrielli has filed a lawsuit against the three witnesses under Article 6(b) of the Law of State Security. This law prohibits defamation of top government officials, including the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, and punishes offenders with up to five years' imprisonment. Targets of Article 6(b) prosecutions can be convicted even if they can prove the truth of their accusations. The law has been condemned by the Organization of American States for violating Article 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights, which protects freedom of expression. In mid-1999 the Lagos government promised to repeal the law, but reform legislation has been blocked in Congress. """"Obviously the armed forces, which have been under criticism since their report on the 'disappeared' was poorly received in Chile, are hitting back against their critics,"""" said Vivanco. """"The world is waiting for President Lagos to take a clear and uncompromising stand in favor of accountability, justice and free speech.""""","Americas, Chile","Torture"

Human Rights Watch called on Israel to conduct an impartial investigation into the shooting and to discipline or bring charges against persons found responsible for the killing.  The incident reportedly occurred at around 6:30 a.m. when the minibus, carrying sixteen Palestinian day laborers from the village of al-Khadr, near Bethlehem, came upon a mound of earth set up as a roadblock by the Israeli army. The driver initially tried to drive around it, but following the soldiers' orders, turned the bus around to return to al-Khadr. One or more of the soldiers then reportedly opened fire on the retreating vehicle from a distance of approximately thirty meters, shattering the rear window and killing Abu Swayyeh. Muhammad Barmil, another worker in the bus, was reportedly seriously injured.  Since the current period of unrest began in late September, Israel has repeatedly rebuffed calls to investigate incidents involving allegedly excessive or indiscriminate use of deadly force against Palestinians.  """"This killing appears to have been entirely unprovoked,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"Israel must investigate all cases where deadly force has been used against unarmed civilians, especially in circumstances that are highly questionable at best.""""  Megally also deplored the killing on Sunday night of thirty-five year old Tsahi Sasson, as he drove along a road near the Israeli settlement of Gilo, and called on the Palestinian Authority to investigate and prosecute those responsible in accordance with internationally accepted fair trial standards.  The organization expressed concern at the continuing Israeli policy of """"liquidation"""" of Palestinians who it claims are responsible for planning or carrying out attacks on Israeli soldiers or settlers. It said Israeli officials have not made public any evidence to substantiate such claims and criticized the lack of a transparent civilian or military review of such decisions. On Tuesday Israeli helicopters fired missiles into a car in the northern Gaza Strip killing Massoud Ayyad, 54, who has been identified as a member of the Palestinian Preventive Security Force, and reportedly injured at least four other persons. The rocket attack was apparently part of Israel's declared policy of """"liquidation."""" Also on Tuesday the Israeli government argued before the country's High Court of Justice that it should not hear a petition against the policy of assassinations by Dr. Siham Thabet, the widow of a Palestinian health official assassinated on December 31. The government argued today that such killings were legitimate acts of war, but it has not made public any information to substantiate the claim that the targeted individuals were responsible for violent attacks or the claim that Israel had no alternative in order to save lives. """"This amounts to a policy of officially-sanctioned killing without public accountability,"""" Megally said. """"Here we have the prime minister effectively acting as prosecutor, judge, and jury in a secret process leading to death sentences that can't be appealed.""""  According to Israeli press reports, the government has refused to respond to a United States government request for clarification of its assassinations policy. The request was related to the State Department's annual country reports on human rights, now in preparation. The Israeli foreign ministry reportedly responded that this was not a human rights issue.

We are deeply concerned about the continuing use of children as soldiers around the world, and urge you to ensure a leadership role for the United States in ending this appalling phenomenon by publicly supporting the new child soldiers protocol, and by encouraging the United States Senate to act swiftly to ratify it.  Worldwide, some 300,000 children under the age of eighteen are currently fighting in approximately thirty conflicts. Their ranks include children as young as eight recruited into Colombia=s paramilitaries, teenaged boys forcibly taken from their villages in Myanmar to serve in the national army, and young girls kidnapped by the Lord=s Resistance Army in Northern Uganda for use as soldiers and sex slaves. Too often, these children learn to kill before they learn to read.  Some child soldiers are recruited by force, while others C impoverished, without access to an education or separated from their families C see armed groups as their best chance at survival. They may begin as messengers or porters, but too often are sent to the front lines of combat where they suffer far higher casualty rates than their adult counterparts. Those who survive are often psychologically traumatized from exposure to brutal violence.  Last year, the nations of the world came together and for the first time, agreed that the use of children in armed conflict is simply unacceptable. After years of negotiation, the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict (the child soldiers protocol). The new protocol establishes eighteen as the minimum age for direct participation in armed conflict, for compulsory recruitment, and for any recruitment or use in hostilities by non-governmental armed groups. Under the agreement, governments are allowed to accept voluntary recruits as young as age sixteen, but with certain safeguards, including parental permission and proof of age.  Since its formal adoption on May 25, 2000 seventy-six governments have signed the protocol. We are proud that the United States was one of the first nations to do so, on July 5, 2000. We now hope that the United States will be one of the first countries to ratify this important agreement. Both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have adopted resolutions urging swift consideration of the protocol, recognizing that United States leadership on this issue will send a clear message to governments and armed groups around the world that the use of children on the battlefield is unconscionable.  We urge you to take a clear public stance against the use of child soldiers early in your administration, and to make U.S. ratification of the child soldiers protocol a priority for your first 100 days in office.

The tribunal sentenced General Jaime Uscátegui to  forty months in prison for his involvement in the 1997 Mapiripán massacre.  """"This works out to a little more than a month for each Colombian murdered in Mapiripán,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas Division of Human Rights Watch. """"It is far too light a sentence to deter future such acts, bearing little relation to the seriousness of the crimes at issue."""" As this case exemplifies, high ranking officers who arrange and assist atrocities continue to be shielded by military tribunals. """"President Pastrana has said that he will ensure that such tribunals no longer deal with human rights cases,"""" said Vivanco, """"This verdict is proof that they continue to shield officers from justice."""" Paramilitary groups working with the tolerance or support of the Colombian military are considered responsible for nearly 80 percent of all human rights violations documented last year in Colombia. In July 1997, paramilitaries working with the Colombian Army killed more than thirty residents of Mapiripán, Meta. Judge Leonardo Iván Cortés tried to alert authorities, including the military, with urgent messages describing the macabre scene that lasted a full five days. """"Each night they kill groups of five to six defenseless people, who are cruelly and monstrously massacred after being tortured,"""" he said. """"The screams of humble people are audible, begging for mercy and asking for help."""" Judge Cortés was later forced to leave Colombia with his family because of threats on his life. Dozens of others fled the village, joining Colombia's massive population of internally displaced. Subsequent investigations by civilian prosecutors reveal that troops under General Uscátegui's command welcomed paramilitaries who arrived at the San José del Guaviare airport, helped them load their trucks, and ensured that local troops who could have fought the paramilitaries were engaged elsewhere. General Uscátegui ignored alerts about the massacre, and a subordinate testified that the general later ordered him to falsify documents to cover up his complicity in it. Not withstanding this evidence, the military tribunal found the general guilty only of """"erring by omission,"""" or failing to act when informed of the massacre. The same tribunal acquitted Uscátegui of the much more serious charges of crimes against humanity, terrorism, lying and conspiracy. Also convicted yesterday was Col. Hernán Orozco, the officer who first alerted General Uscátegui to reports of a massacre. Orozco later cooperated with civilian investigators, and his testimony helped Colombia's Attorney General prepare formal charges against Uscátegui for aiding and abetting paramilitary groups. However, jurisdiction over the case was awarded to the military courts, which has long been one of the cornerstones of impunity in Colombia. Orozco later asked that his case be sent to a civilian court for prosecution, arguing that he would not receive a fair trial. Yesterday's verdict included a sentence for Orozco of thirty-eight months. His crime was characterized as """"failing to insist"""" that a superior officer send troops, an absurdity given that he had notified Uscátegui promptly of reports coming from Mapiripán. Human Rights Watch has repeatedly called for the Colombian government to enforce its law requiring that allegations of human rights violations committed by security force officers be investigated and tried by civilian courts, not military tribunals.","Americas, Colombia",""

Should Press Russia on Chechnya","","02/12/2001","Russian officials have done almost nothing to investigate atrocities in Chechnya and European  officials should not let them off the hook. On the eve of a visit by E.U. officials to Moscow this week, the watchdog group released a new analysis detailing the procuracy’s feeble efforts to investigate some of the worst atrocities of the eighteen-month war. “Last year the E.U. stressed repeatedly that only the Russians can punish their own troops for abuse in Chechnya, without international interference,” said Holly Cartner, executive director of Human Rights Watch’s Europe and Central Asia division. “But now it’s clear that the Russian government is not investigating these crimes in good faith, and the E.U. has to call them on it.” The 10-page analysis, based on dozens of recent Human Rights Watch interviews with victims’ relatives and on correspondence with the Russian procuracy, charges that government investigations have been too few and of poor quality. One-third of the 35 investigations against servicemen relate to inadvertent or minor crimes; only 12 pertain to murder. More than one year after 130 civilians were killed in the execution-style murders in Alkhan-Yurt, Staropromyslovski, and Aldi, no one has been held criminally accountable. A few investigations into individual murders in these massacres were launched, but only after victims’ relatives had filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights. Many relatives have not been questioned, and many bodies remain to be exhumed. Law enforcement agencies have made no effort to gain the trust of witnesses who are terrified of further abuse. Witnesses are too frightened to report for questioning to the Khankala military base, where many Chechen men have “disappeared” in custody. No one has been charged with torture, despite hundreds of well-documented cases. Investigations into the “disappearances” of individuals taken into Russian custody have stalled due to lack of cooperation on the part of the military. Meanwhile, abuses continue. Russian soldiers and police on sweep operations arbitrarily detain men and women, particularly young Chechen men ranging in age from fifteen to forty-five, and loot homes. Detainees are frequently taken to makeshift detention facilities such as earthen pits, where they are routinely tortured and denied all due process rights. Many detainees have “disappeared” without a trace after being taken into Russian custody. Groups of masked men, often speaking unaccented Russian, burst into homes of civilians at night and take away or kill their inhabitants. Chechen rebels have threatened and killed civilian administrators and are presumably responsible for the bombing of Russian positions that have killed and wounded numerous civilians. “The E.U. can’t just set aside the Chechnya mess in order to do ‘real business’ with Russia,” said Cartner. “This is their real business with Russia.”","Europe/Central Asia, Russia",""

February 12, 2001 His Excellency Yasir Arafat President Palestinian Authority Gaza City Gaza Your Excellency, Human Rights Watch is writing to urge you not to ratify yesterday's death sentence passed by a military court in Hebron against Hassan Mohammed Hassan Musallem. We understand that Mr. Musallem, an officer with the Palestinian security forces, was found guilty of collaborating with the Israel Defense Forces, allegedly by supplying them with information and by opening fire from a Palestinian sector of Hebron, thereby providing a pretext for Israeli return of fire. We fully recognize the duty and responsibility of the Palestinian Authority to seek to bring to justice those who have committed criminal offences, such as those for which Mr. Musallem has been convicted. We do, however, oppose the use of the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life, both because of its inherent cruelty, and because of the possibility that individuals wrongly convicted may be executed. We are also deeply disturbed by the Palestinian Authority's recourse to the death penalty in cases where defendants received grossly unfair trials before state security and military courts whose verdicts may have been influenced by political considerations. This has continued despite Your Excellency's statements that the Palestinian Authority is committed to respect internationally recognized human rights standards and to incorporate them into Palestinian law. Press reports suggest that in the case of Mr. Musallem, he may have the right to appeal to a higher tribunal--unlike in previous cases where convictions were issued after military trials which lasted only a few hours and where the accused had no access to legal representation or the right of appeal. At a minimum, all suspects tried before any Palestinian court should be provided with the following internationally recognized rights: to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; to be tried before a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal; to be informed of the nature and basis of the charges against him or her; to have adequate time to prepare a defense, to present a defense to the charges, and call witnesses in their defense; to be provided with legal representation, paid by the state, if necessary; to examine the evidence and the witnesses against him or her; not to be compelled to testify against himself or herself, or to confess guilt; and, to appeal conviction and sentence to a higher tribunal according to law. In addition, persons sentenced to death should always have the right to seek pardon or commutation of their sentence. Your Excellency, it is a matter of deep concern to Human Rights Watch that the Palestinian Authority continues to defy the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty by handing down death sentences and carrying out executions. Human Rights Watch again urges you to undertake the progressive restriction and ultimate elimination of the death penalty in Palestinian law. We also urge you to commute to a lesser sentence the death sentence against Mr. Musallem, should it eventually be brought before you for ratification. It is to the credit of the Palestinian Authority that until last month you had maintained a twenty-two month moratorium on executions. In light of reports that in recent weeks an unknown number of Palestinians have been arrested as suspected collaborators, we appeal to Your Excellency to immediately suspend all executions and to ensure that all those brought to trial are afforded the necessary due process rights as guaranteed under international law.

It called in particular on countries that have official """"dialogues"""" on human rights with China to attend the trial in Chengdu, Sichuan scheduled to begin on Tuesday in the Chengdu Intermediate People's Court. The United Kingdom has a dialogue meeting set for February 12-14 in Beijing, and the European Union has a meeting with China in Stockholm scheduled for February 22. """"It's precisely when serious violations arise that the human rights dialogues with China should be put to the test,"""" said Jan van der Made, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. """"Are exchanges on human rights confined to polite rhetoric, or will China's dialogue partners take issue with the treatment of people like Huang Qi?"""" Huang Qi, a computer engineer, was charged with the political crime of """"instigation to subvert state power."""" In the indictment signed by Li Jian, chief of the Chengdu City Police on August 21, 2000, Huang Qi was accused of using his """"Tianwang Missing Persons Web Site"""" to post material about various taboo topics, including the democracy movement, the Xinjiang independence movement, Falun Gong, and demands for the reversal of the official position on """"June 4."""" Huang Qi was detained on June 3, 2000.

""""This case is designed to send a warning to anyone who uses the Internet to transmit 'sensitive' material,"""" said Van der Made. He noted that Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, a human rights treaty that China got great credit for signing in 1998 but has yet to ratify, guarantees the right of anyone to """"seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers"""" through the media of his or her choice.

""""They have good reason to come to his defense."""" On September 25, Huang Qi was reportedly beaten in detention by three policemen after notes he had taken were confiscated. During the beating, he lost one tooth and got a scar on his forehead, according to a letter he gave to his lawyer in November. On January 2, 2001, the Chengdu City Procuratorate accused Huang Qi of violating Articles 103 and 105 of the Criminal Law. The articles punish actions that involve """"organizing national separatism, destroying national unity""""; """"organizing, plotting or carrying out activities aimed at subverting state political power""""; and """"overthrowing the socialist system."""" If convicted, he could receive up to ten years in prison. Human Rights Watch has documented some twenty cases of people who have been detained for actions relating to the Internet.

These were protections the U.K. once helped put in place."""" In a speech on Tuesday, Straw elaborated on a proposal he made last June to reform the 1951 Refugee Convention -- the cornerstone of international refugee protection -- in order to make it more relevant to modern-day migration movements. Straw wants to reduce the number of asylum seekers traveling to Western European countries and curtail perceived abuse of the asylum system by so-called """"economic migrants."""" While the proposal aims to control flows of refugees into Europe, it gives scant attention to tackling the conditions that force migrants and refugees to move in the first place, said Reilly.

Three foreign residents of Saudi Arabia -- from the United Kingdom, Canada, and Belgium -- appeared on Saudi television on February 4, confessing to two car bombings that claimed the life of one Briton and injured others in November 2000. Human Rights Watch pointed out that the confessions were made after the detainees were held in prolonged incommunicado detention and were aired on television before completion of the criminal investigation or formal charging. """"Confessions obtained in such circumstances should not be admissible in court,"""" said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. """"The defendants should be questioned again in the presence of their lawyers to ensure that their statements were not obtained under duress.""""  The international monitoring organization cited Saudi interior minister Prince Nayef bin Abdul-Aziz's own acknowledgement, in an interview with the Arabic-language daily newspaper al-Sharq al-Awsat on February 6, that """"we have not completed the investigation.""""  One of the suspects who """"confessed"""" was U.K. citizen Alexander Mitchell. Saudi authorities did not notify Britain of his arrest on December 17, 2000, and he was held in incommunicado detention until late January. The Canadian suspect, William Sampson, was arrested on December 16, 2000 and held incommunicado until January 27, 2001.  Human Rights Watch called on Saudi authorities to end the routine practice of incommunicado detention, and to provide all detainees with access to lawyers during the criminal investigation process, including interrogation. The organization also said that the governments of detained foreign nationals should be promptly informed following arrests and permitted immediately to communicate with them.  It is not clear who ordered that the alleged confessions of the three Westerners be broadcast on Saudi television on February 4, prior to the completion of the investigation and formal lodging of charges.  Under Saudi law, the investigation and prosecution of criminal offenses is the responsibility of the Public Investigation and Prosecution Department. This branch of the judicial authority """"forms part of the Kingdom's system of criminal justice"""" and """"functions in a fully independent manner,"""" according to the Saudi Foreign Ministry. Article 5 of the department's statutes states: """"The members of the Department shall enjoy full independence and, in their work, shall be subject only to the provisions of the Islamic shariah and the regulations in force. No one shall have the right to interfere in their work.""""  Human Rights Watch said it was not plausible that the director of the Public Investigation and Prosecution Department (PIPD) would have the authority to order the showing of videotaped confessions of alleged suspects on television. """"The interior minister has stated publicly that the investigation of this case is in progress,"""" said Megally. """"If so, the public broadcasting of confessions during an investigation suggests high-level interference.""""  Human Rights Watch called on Saudi officials to disclose whether the three men were provided with attorneys during the criminal examination process and, particularly, when the alleged confessions were taken. Under Saudi law, the right to counsel is guaranteed. This right was noted by the Saudi Foreign Ministry in a report published last year entitled """"Protection of Human Rights in Criminal Procedure and in the Organization of the Justice System."""" The report stated in pertinent part:  During an interrogation, a suspect has a guaranteed right to a lawyer or legal representative who, having attended the examination, is entitled to submit a written memorandum containing his comments, which the examiner must include in the case file. The examiner does not have the right to separate the accused from his lawyer or legal representative during the examination.  Human Rights Watch noted that the Foreign Ministry's report also stated that interrogations should """"take place in circumstances that do not influence the suspect's freedom to make statements and present his defense."""" The organization said it was deeply concerned that the suspects were held incommunicado.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, an international treaty that obligates state parties to respect and enforce the rights of all persons, including those facing criminal charges. But the Kingdom is a party to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.

In a letter sent to all E.U. foreign ministers, the human rights monitoring group urged them to tell their counterparts in Belgrade that future E.U. funding to the Yugoslav government will require cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, including the arrest and transfer of indicted war criminals living in Serbia.   """"In the early weeks after the October revolution, President Kostunica could plausibly argue that he needed time,"""" said Cartner. """"But the honeymoon is now over and the international community should make clear to Yugoslav officials that it demands cooperation with the Tribunal.""""   Human Rights Watch also urged the E.U. to adopt a common position on aid to Yugoslavia that would make E.U. assistance conditioned on cooperation with the Tribunal and other reform measures. Although Prime Minister Goran Persson of Sweden, which currently holds the rotating E.U. Presidency, is reported to have told Yugoslav President Vojislav Kostunica last week that continued E.U. funds require cooperation with the Tribunal, the E.U. has not formally adopted this position as binding policy. The United States government has set 1 April as the deadline by which Yugoslav authorities must be cooperating with the Tribunal, including the arrest and transfer of indictees, or else face a funding cut-off.   Human Rights Watch made the appeal after the Tribunal prosecutor, Carla Del Ponte, recently received a chilly welcome in Belgrade from President Kostunica. Questioning the legality and procedures of the Tribunal, Kostunica reportedly told Del Ponte that his government would not cooperate in the apprehension of indicted war crimes suspects for trial by the Tribunal in the Hague.

Foreign Ministers","02/06/2001","We are writing to you as a matter of urgency, to ask you to make accountability for war-time abuses in the former Yugoslavia a  priority of E.U. policy and to take immediate steps to ensure that all of those indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the  Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) are arrested and turned over to the Tribunal for trial. Specifically, we urge the E.U. to adopt a common  policy identifying cooperation with the ICTY, including the transfer of indictees, as a specific condition of future E.U. assistance to  the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  This is a critical moment for the Balkan peace process. While the changes in government in Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) have created an opportunity to end the cycle of nationalist violence that has plagued the Balkans, the transformation remains extremely fragile. Only a completed process of accountability, meted out fairly and consistently at the international level among all parties to the conflict can consolidate the peace and ensure lasting stability in the region. In the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, hopes of a clean break with the abuses of the past are being dashed by President Kostunica's blatant disrespect for the jurisdiction of the international tribunal. His statements challenging the objectivity or impartiality of the Tribunal and his obstinate refusal to cooperate promptly with the ICTY belie his stated commitment to uphold the rule of law. By contrast, other officials in the federal and Serbian governments have called publicly for the arrest and surrender of Milosevic to the Hague. The international community must unambiguously condemn Kostunica's refusal to cooperate with the Tribunal in the apprehension of indictees who remain on FRY territory and establish a clear set of benchmarks and a timetable for compliance that is clearly linked to future assistance. Any other response risks irreparably undermining the position of those in the governments of FRY and Serbia, not to mention Croatia, who are committed to full cooperation with the Tribunal as a matter of ethical and legal obligation and a necessary precondition for lasting peace and full reintegration into the international community. The E.U. should not entertain suggestions that Milosevic can be tried for war crimes in a domestic court in FRY. Such proposals ignore FRY obligations under U.N. Security Council resolutions to defer to the Tribunal matters within its jurisdiction. This obligation applies to all of the indictees at large in FRY. Moreover, war crimes trials of the Serb leadership before domestic courts in FRY would enjoy no legitimacy among the victims of atrocities in Bosnia, Croatia, and Kosovo. For their sake, as well as long-term peace and stability in the region, the E.U. and its allies must emphatically insist on FRY cooperation with the ICTY. In this vein, we heartily welcome reports that Prime Minister Persson has warned President Kostunica that continued E.U. aid will depend on his government's cooperation with the Tribunal. We call on the E.U. to reinforce this message: · In public and private statements during the E.U. Troika visit to Belgrade on 9 February, we hope that E.U. officials will unequivocally specify that future aid to the FRY and Serbian governments will be conditioned on ICTY cooperation; and · We urge the E.U. to adopt a common position at the 26-27 February General Affairs Council, identifying cooperation with the ICTY, including the transfer of indictees, as an unconditional benchmark to be achieved by a specified date to ensure future E.U. assistance to the FRY and Serbian governments (as has been the case regarding the governments of Bosnia and Hercegovina and Croatia). At the same time that the E.U. signals the importance that it attaches to FRY cooperation with the ICTY, it is imperative that this message be reinforced by renewed efforts to bring to justice indictees remaining at large in Bosnia and Hercegovina. The long-standing impunity enjoyed by Bosnian Serb war-time leader Radovan Karadzic and other perpetrators of ethnic cleansing, serves only to embolden those in Bosnia and throughout the region who continue to harbor a nationalist vision and pursue incendiary politics to that end, undermining moderate leaders' efforts to promote reconciliation, Western integration, and political and economic reform. Whether through negotiated surrenders or NATO arrest operations, all indicted war crimes suspects in Bosnia and Hercegovina must be brought to justice. We hope that this remains a priority for E.U. policy in the Balkans. Thank you very much for your attention to our concerns.

Cavallo, a former military official from Argentina implicated in atrocities committed during that country's seven-year military dictatorship, faces prosecution for torture, genocide and terrorism in a case under the jurisdiction of Spanish Judge Balthazar Garzón, known for his prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.  """"The Foreign Minister's decision is an extraordinary step toward accountability for human rights abuses,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"It also signals a dramatic change in Mexican foreign policy. By playing an active role in international efforts to prosecute atrocities, Mexico is making history.""""  The foreign minister's extradition decision is based on a January 12 Mexican judicial ruling that set out the legal basis for extradition. The present decision is, however, even broader than the earlier court decision, which had authorized Cavallo's prosecution for genocide and terrorism, but not torture.  Cavallo is now expected to file a legal challenge, known as """"amparo,"""" to the decision in the Mexican courts.  Cavallo is the second Argentine to be detained abroad for human rights crimes committed in Argentina during the country's 1976-1983 military dictatorship. (The first was retired Major Jorge Olivera, who was detained in Rome last year and then released due to irregularities of the Italian courts.) Cavallo was arrested in Cancun last August, as he attempted to catch a plane to Buenos Aires. Before his arrest, he lived and worked in Mexico, serving as the director of the National Registry of Motor vehicles.  According to a November 1999 indictment issued by Spanish Judge Garzón, Cavallo, known by the name of Miguel Angel Cavallo, was a Navy lieutenant who worked in the notorious Navy Mechanics School (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada, ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the military regime. Between January 1977 and October 1978, the indictment states, Cavallo belonged to the operations sector of Working Group 3.3.2, a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing persons perceived as leftist by the military. The indictment names Cavallo as a participant in the torture of Thelma Jara de Cabezas, and the execution of Mónica Jauregui and Elba Delia Aldaya.  The 1984 report of the Argentine truth commission names 8,961 people who """"disappeared"""" under the military dictatorship, and it notes that this figure is not exhaustive. Although some high-level officials were criminally prosecuted in the 1980s for these abuses, the vast majority of military perpetrators were protected by the country's amnesty laws, while pardons issued by then-President Menem in 1989 and 1990 freed those who had been convicted.  In the view of Human Rights Watch, the Cavallo prosecution extends the precedent set by the arrest of General Pinochet in London in 1998.

Two high-ranking police officials from the Milosevic era have been removed from office, but another official with a terrible record of human rights abuse has been promoted to an important position within the Ministry of Interior.  On January 30, Colonel Sreten Lukic was appointed as new chief of public security and deputy Serbian Interior Minister. Lukic was in charge of the regular uniformed police in Kosovo during 1998 and 1999, during which police under his command committed numerous crimes and abuses, including torture, indiscriminate attacks, forced expulsions, and extrajudicial executions.  """"The appointment of Sreten Lukic raises serious doubts about the new Serbian government's commitment to police reform and to accountability for past abuses,"""" said Holly Cartner, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Europe and Central Asia division. """"People who should be investigated for their role in war crimes and other serious abuses are instead being rewarded.""""  At the same time, the newly appointed Serbian government dismissed two top officials, Lieutenant Generals Vlastimir Djordjevic and Obrad Stevanovic. Both Djordjevic and Stevanovic played key roles in Milosevic's repressive security apparatus, including having command of Serbian Ministry of Interior forces in Kosovo. Djordjevic, known informally as """"Rodja"""" (""""Cousin""""), was head of the ministry's public security service, as well as an assistant to the minister. Stevanovic commanded the police department of the public security service.  Prior to this promotion, Lukic was an assistant chief of police in Belgrade. At the time he was stationed in Kosovo, he was the Chief of the Headquarters of the Ministry of Interior in Pristina. On numerous occasions, Lukic was presented by the ministry as its main interlocutor with foreigners in Kosovo, as well as the main contact person for the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission (KDOM). Lukic's superior during 1998 and 1999, former Serbian Minister of the Interior Vlajko Stojiljkovic, was indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in May 1999 for crimes against humanity committed in Kosovo.  Lukic's name also appeared in January 1999, after the killing of forty-five Kosovar Albanians in the village of Racak. According to the Washington Post of January 28, 1999, Western governments had intercepted conversations between """"Serbian Interior Minister General Sreten Lukic"""" and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Nikola Sainovic, who has also been indicted by the Yugoslav Tribunal. Western sources familiar with the intercepts claimed that the two officials ordered their forces to """"go in heavy.""""

""""This kind of statement should have prompted an immediate rejoinder from C.H. Tung, and yet all we've heard is deafening silence."""" Despite a nearly two year campaign against Falun Gong by the Chinese government, Hong Kong's Leisure and Culture Services Department allowed the group's local branch to rent out City Hall for a major meeting on January 14. Yesterday's warning from the Liaison Office was followed by calls from pro-Beijing business people and politicians in Hong Kong to strip Falun Gong of its status as a registered society. It was also followed by a worrisome editorial in the privately owned South China Morning Post, warning human rights activists to be careful about which causes they take up. The warnings on Falun Gong are the latest in a series of incidents that have led many in the human rights community to worry about the erosion of political freedom in Hong Kong. Those incidents include the Hong Kong's government's January 18 decision to ask the Court of Final Appeal to seek Beijing's guidance on a right of abode case involving a three-year-old Chinese boy, raising new questions about the judiciary's independence.

In a report issued yesterday, the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on East Timor concluded that ultimate responsibility for the terror rests with the Indonesian army, which facilitated and in certain cases directly participated in the abuses. The report also urged the creation of an international investigatory body and for steps to be put in motion for establishment of an international tribunal to bring those responsible to justice. """"Justice for East Timor is at a crossroads,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. """"The U.N. commission's findings should put to rest the Indonesian army's self-serving claims that the systematic destruction of East Timor was the work of crazed militias and a handful of disobedient soldiers. The Commission's findings make it imperative that investigations continue until all those responsible can be brought to justice."""" Indonesia's own national commission of inquiry on East Timor also issued its report yesterday. It called for establishment of a special """"human rights court"""" in Indonesia and named more than thirty Indonesian officers believed responsible for the terror in East Timor, including General Wiranto and five other Indonesian generals.  Saunders noted that the Indonesian investigators, working under tremendous pressure and at considerable personal risk, did a remarkable job. He emphasized, however, that it is too early to say whether any Indonesian tribunal will have sufficient resources or authority to conduct what will undoubtedly be expensive, drawn-out trials of military leaders. It will be difficult to ensure that such prosecutions stay free of pressures from the military, currently engaged in a struggle with the new civilian government of Abdurrahman Wahid to retain its old political power.  """"International investigations must continue if there is to be any hope of serious pursuit of justice on the Indonesian side,"""" Saunders said. """"And if for any reason Indonesia proves unable or unwilling to pursue justice, the international community must step in."""" He noted that it takes time, resources, and skilled investigators to build the kind of cases necessary to win convictions and urged that the U.N. Security Council ensure that additional resources are pledged to support a vigorous international investigation.  Human Rights Watch also welcomed President Wahid's call for prosecutions of army leaders. President Wahid, speaking on Monday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, reportedly said that he will soon ask Wiranto, Indonesian military chief at the time of the East Timor carnage, to resign his current post as Coordinating Minister for Politics and Security Affairs. The president reportedly also said that he would pardon Wiranto, but only after a trial, and that no other military officers would be pardoned. The president has publicly rejected an international tribunal, preferring trials of military officials before a special Indonesian court.  """"We welcome President Wahid's call for accountability and trials of army leaders,"""" said Saunders. """"The principle of accountability must be upheld, whether it is an Indonesian court or an international tribunal that ultimately hears the cases."""" He emphasized, however, that any decision to pardon Wiranto would be premature and must under no circumstances serve as an opening to broader impunity for the armed forces.  How the trials of the generals are handled will have important implications not only for justice in East Timor but also for the process of reform in Indonesia. Much of the regional and sectarian conflict in Indonesia today has been fueled by public frustration with lack of accountability for past injustices and a resultant loss of faith in the ability of government institutions to broker fair resolutions of disputes. Hard-line military officers disgruntled with the new civilian leadership are also rumored to be directly behind some of the violence.  """"Impunity for the armed forces must end,"""" said Saunders. """"Establishing accountability for the abuses in East Timor is a necessary beginning.""""

He and his supporters claim substantial progress in restoring a nation devastated by a genocide that killed at least half a million Tutsi and thousands of Hutu opponents of the genocide. In fact, the situation is less impressive than it seems and any advances on the domestic front must also be put in the context of the government's record of egregious violations of the laws of war. Military Record   In 1994 the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and the Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA) defeated and drove from Rwanda the government responsible for the genocide. In 1997 and 1998, the RPA suppressed an insurgency in the Rwandan northwest, led in part by soldiers and militia of the defeated government. In 1996 and again in 1998 Rwanda invaded the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo and continues a war there today, citing as pretext the need to protect itself against the remnants of soldiers and militia from the former government. The Rwandan armed forces number more than 50,000 while combatants linked to the former government number some 10,000 or 15,000, although their ranks have been swelled by other Rwandans not involved in the genocide and by other Congolese allies.   In the meantime, RPA troops have taken control of a resource-rich territory approximately fifteen times the size of Rwanda itself. In its military operations from 1994 on, RPA soldiers killed tens of thousands of civilians, some inside Rwanda, some in the Congo. These violations of international humanitarian law were documented by the U.N. Secretary-General's Investigative Team, by the U.N. Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda, and by international and local human rights organizations.   The Rwandan government acknowledges that its soldiers have committed war crimes but insists that it has not authorized them and that it has tried and punished the guilty. Several dozen soldiers have been convicted for crimes committed in Rwanda, but the number punished represents only a small part of those responsible for these crimes. In most cases, superior officers have received minimal sentences and ordinary soldiers have been punished most heavily.   Democratization and Elections    The Rwandan government names decentralization of the administration and democratization of the political process as among its chief objectives. It has made little progress towards these goals. President Kagame heads one of the most intensively administered states in the world, presides over its only functioning political party, and controls in fact, if not in name, the armed forces. His party, the RPF, nominally shares power with others at the national level but it is the only political organization to operate at the local level. During the last few months, the RPF has been activelyâ€""""sometimes aggressivelyâ€""""organizing in communities throughout Rwanda, but other parties cannot hold local meetings or other activities essential to being an effective political force.   As part of its move towards """"democratization,"""" the government points with pride to election of local officials. In elections in March 1999, there were few reports of irregularities but the system itself inhibited free choice.   Political party activity was prohibited and voters did not use secret ballots, as in elections under previous governments, but instead signified their vote by lining up publicly behind the candidates. In elections planned for March 6 this year, the government has again carefully structured a system which will likely operate without any apparent irregularities and yet may fall far short of accurately indicating the popular will. A six person electoral commission acted by administrative order to establish a complex system of indirect voting: in each sector, voters choose one general representative, one representative of women, and one for young people. The groups of representatives of women and young people then choose one third of their members to sit with the general sector representatives as the district council. This council in combination with those officials chosen in 1999 elect the mayor and four others to form the executive council of the district.   Some Rwandans who publicly questioned why they could not chose mayors by a direct, one person-one vote system were told that the decision came from above and could not be challenged. The complexity of the system and the large voice given to officials who have served the government for two years leaves the process open to behind-the-scenes manipulation. In addition, only candidates approved by the electoral commission may run.   In several cases reported to Human Rights Watch, persons who chose not to run were coerced into doing so by local electoral officials. Political parties are barred from any electoral activity. Campaigning is limited to a fifteen day period and may take place only under conditions set by the electoral commission or its subcommissions. Anyone who violates the restrictions on campaigning, including mentioning affiliation with a political party, is liable to be fined between U.S. $1500 and $2250 and imprisoned between three and five years.   Justice    The Rwandan government rightly claims that delivering justice for a genocide represented a daunting task, particularly when it was undertaken with scant material and human resources. In 1994 the government was short of money, burdened with crumbling courthouses, and confronted with a serious lack of police, prosecutors, and udgesâ€""""some having been victims, others perpetrators of genocide. But lack of political will as much as logistical difficulties slowed the relaunching of the judicial system. The investment of millions of dollars of aid and the contribution of considerable international expertise in the years since 1994 have failed to move the process ahead rapidly. After six and a half years, the government has some 119,000 persons in jail, fewer than 4,000 of them tried and convicted. Of the 115,000 others, a substantial number have not been interrogated and do not have judicial case files. In recent trials, approximately twenty percent of the accused have been found not guilty, an indication that there are large numbers of persons detained who may well be innocent.   In some cases, persons acquitted after trial remain in prison or have been arrested again shortly after their release. Local officials often explain this as a measure necessary for the safety of the detainees. Conditions in Rwandan prisons are deplorable and in some cases inhumane. According to the special representative for Rwanda of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, some prisoners receive nothing to eat for three or four days at a time. The ministry in charge of prisons has received less than half of the amount budgeted for the purchase of food for prisoners. Until late 2000 more than 400 children were detained on accusations of having committed genocide although they had been under the age of criminal responsibility, fourteen years old, at the time of their alleged crime. The special representative for Rwanda of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights described their plight to the General Assembly in November 2000 and most of these children were released for training in a solidarity camp (see below) the following month.   Gacaca    In the past gacaca was a community-based practice for resolving conflicts, but the term now refers to a highly structured, state-organized form of popular courts meant to deliver justice for the genocide. The new process will reflect the local political dynamics in each community, producing credible judgments in some cases but not in others. The system provides few safeguards for the accused in those communities where the system does not work as it should. Arguing that the usual court system would take hundreds of years to try all those now accused, the government has spent more than two years discussing gacaca. Although the law establishing the system has been passed by the legislature, it has not yet been officially published, presumably because the constitutional court still has it under review. Far from a spontaneous gathering of community elders, the current gacaca system will include more than 250,000 """"judges"""" serving in some 11,000 jurisdictions, modeled on the current administrative hierarchy, and supervised by authorities from the Supreme Court.   The introduction to the draft legislation stresses that justice will be rendered within the local community by those who witnessed the crimes. Yet in many communities, the current population is significantly different from that in place at the time of the genocide. Many Rwandans no longer live where they did in 1994, either because they have moved of their own volition or because they have been forcibly relocated by the government. In addition, hundreds of thousands of persons of Rwandan origin who lived outside the country before 1994 have taken up residence inside the country. Certainly not eyewitnesses and perhaps previously unacquainted with either victims or perpetrators, they will be allowed to participate in the gacaca jurisdictions.   The electoral procedure is not detailed in the law but it is specified that """"politically active"""" persons and members of """"managing bodies of political parties, religious sects, or nongovernmental organizations"""" may not serve as judges.   In the past, gacaca operated independently of the state with neither contending party enjoying the advantage of official support. The new gacaca jurisdictions can be provided with the """"assistance of legal advisers,"""" appointed by the Supreme Court. In addition, the public prosecutor participates by investigating cases, providing files to the jursidictions, and appearing as a witness against the accused, if requested to do so. Faced with this power of the state, the accused has no defense but his or her own wits and the support of family and friends. He or she has no right to legal counsel.   Gacaca jurisdictions may punish the convicted with prison terms, half of which can be transmuted into some form of labor for the public good. The conditions of this labor are to be determined by the President of the Republic. There is apparently no requirement that judges take account of jail time already served in pre-trial detention, which can amount to as much as six and a half years.   Gacaca jurisdictions may judge accusations of crimes against humanity as well as of genocide. Soldiers of the former government accused of genocide will apparently be judged in gacaca jurisdictions, but not RPF soldiers accused of crimes against humanity. Rwandan authorities said that RPF soldiers will continue to be judged only in military courts.   Reconciliation    Genuine reconciliation on a large scale may have to await the establishment of a functioning judicial system. In the meantime, various groups, particularly of women, have found ways to cooperate at the local level for shared, concrete objectives, such as earning money to pay school fees or health expenses for their children. In some of these groups, women who have survived the genocide work together with women whose husbands or sons are imprisoned on accusation of genocide.   The National Commission for Unity and Reconciliation has organized a number of activities, including a national conference in late 2000 which drew few of those invited from outside Rwanda. The highly structured program included many long presentations and offered few opportunities for spontaneous exchanges among participants.   The National Commission for Unity and Reconciliation also organizes """"solidarity camps,"""" training sessions that vary in length from one to three months. Originally used to """"re-educate"""" returnees who had fled into exile when the RPF took over, the camps have since been required for many administrative officials and university students. Combatants from armed opposition groups captured by the government or who have surrendered voluntarily are re-educated at the camps, as were the children released from detention in December 2000. Ideological training figures importantly in the program at the camps but participants also undergo physical training and some of them, military training. In many camps participants wear military uniform and learn to shoot. According to children released from detention who participated in the camp, they were not given arms training because they were too young. But, as one child commented, """"They teach us things so that it will be easy for us to join military service later.""""   Challenged about the appropriateness of including weapons training among reconciliation activities, Rwandan authorities said that it is important """"demystify"""" the """"myth about the army and the gun"""" for the """"self-defence and benefit of all Rwandese.""""","Africa, Rwanda, Uganda","International Justice"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/02/01/colombia-pastrana-bush-summit","Colombia- The Pastrana-Bush Summit","Colombia: The Pastrana-Bush Summit","","02/01/2001","When Colombian President Andrés Pastrana meets with President George W. Bush next Tuesday (February 27), the two leaders will discuss U.S. military aid to Colombia, including the issue of Colombia's progress on improving human rights. This background briefing outlines the key human rights problems in Colombia and includes sample questions to be put to the two presidents at their joint press conference. Political Violence in Colombia Political violence is dramatically up in Colombia, in part the result of efforts by all sides to gain territorial control, increase revenue to fund war, and influence talks between rebels and the government. This continues a disturbing trend from the year 2000, when the average number of victims of political violence and deaths in combat rose to fourteen per day according to the Colombian Commission of Jurists. Even by the Colombian National Police department's own estimate, there were twenty-three massacres by paramilitaries in the first seventeen days of 2001. Paramilitaries belonging to the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, AUC) committed the largest single massacre on January 17 in the village of Chengue, Sucre, with at least twenty-six people registered killed. Military-Paramilitary Ties Ties between paramilitaries and Colombian army and navy brigades remain strong and intimate. [See Human Rights Watch's 2000 Report: The Ties That Bind: Colombia and Military-Paramilitary]. These military brigades are deployed throughout the country, meaning that such relationships between the military and paramilitary groups are neither isolated nor unusual. They exist at the national level and include units in Colombia's largest cities. Paramilitary groups working with the tolerance or support of the Colombian military are considered responsible for nearly 80 percent of all human rights violations documented last year in Colombia. Ties means active coordination in the field with paramilitary units; permanent communication via radios, cellular telephones, and beepers; the sharing of intelligence, including the names of suspected guerrillas collaborators; the sharing of fighters, including active-duty soldiers serving in paramilitary units and paramilitary commanders lodging on military bases; the sharing of vehicles, including army trucks used to transport paramilitary fighters; coordination of army roadblocks, which are suspended to let paramilitary fighters pass; and payments made from paramilitaries to military officers for their support. Among them, the Army's Twenty-Fourth Brigade is slated to receive U.S. aid and training through the billion-dollar anti-drug strategy, Plan Colombia. Human Rights Watch has plentiful and convincing evidence linking the Twenty-Fourth Brigade to direct support for and collaboration with paramilitaries under the command of Carlos Castaño. Although investigators with Colombia's Internal Affairs agency (Procuraduría) recommended investigating Colonel Gabriel Díaz, the former commander of this unit, five months ago for tolerating paramilitary activity, this officer not only remains on active duty, but is currently completing the course work necessary for a promotion to the rank of general. The Colombian government announced on January 15, 2001, the creation of an Anti-Assassin Committee (Comité Anti-Sicarial), with the stated goal of pursuing and capturing paramilitary groups. In the past, similar committees have been no more than paper tigers. A similar group announced on October 4, 1998, produced no visible improvement. Another, announced in February 2000 after a similar series of massacres, never even met. Human rights defenders remain in danger, despite government promises to take effective measures to protect them. Most attacks on human rights workers are perpetrated by paramilitary groups. On February 13, 2001, ten gunmen attacked and killed Iván Villamizar, the former Public Advocate in Cúcuta, Norte de Santander. During his tenure as advocate, Villamizar had been repeatedly threatened by paramilitary groups for his work documenting massacres carried out with Colombian army collusion in the La Gabarra region in 1998. Far from fortifying the work of human rights, President Pastrana has cut funding for key government investigators. The Attorney General reported in September 2000 that budget cuts implemented by President Pastrana are """"dramatic"""" and threaten to """"paralyze"""" the work of the Human Rights Unit, responsible for progress on important cases. Dozens of defenders have had to suspend their work or flee the country because of threats on their lives. Forced displacement is one of the most visible symptoms of political violence. Human rights groups estimate that at least 317,000 Colombians became displaced in 2000; of those, an estimated 15,000 crossed Colombia's borders for an uncertain future as refugees. This represents an all time high for a single year. Human rights groups estimate that over 600,000 Colombians have become displaced since President Pastrana took office. Damage by the U.S. Human Rights Waiver The decision by the Clinton Administration to waive human rights conditions contained in Public Law 106-246 has been devastating. Judged by its behavior in the field B not by rhetoric or public relations pamphlets B the Colombian military understood the waiver as a virtual carte blanche for its strategy, which depends on continued, active coordination with paramilitary groups. As long as Colombia's military high command understands that the United States will not enforce human rights conditions, we do not expect progress in the protection of human rights. The deterioration has been dramatic and devastating for Colombia, particularly since the waiver was invoked on August 22, 2000. High-ranking military officers continue to attack human rights groups, calling them guerrilla facades or even drug traffickers, in defiance of President Pastrana's explicit orders to respect the work of these groups. Recently, Air Force commander Gen. Héctor Fabio Velásco Chávez asserted that human rights are being """"utilized by some ultra-Left movements, which wield as a facade the so-called non-governmental organizations and lend themselves warmly to dark plots."""" He went on to claim that human rights groups """"try to delegitimize us using the extortion [sic] of the truth, lies, and slander."""" U.S. funds meant to support the Human Rights Unit of the Attorney General's office have yet to be disbursed, a damaging delay that ignores the emergency nature of the human rights situation in Colombia. In addition, the Witness Protection Program continues to be seriously short of funds, limiting witnesses to only three months of protection. Once that period is concluded, witnesses are on their own again, exposing them to serious risk. Guerrilla Violations The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, FARC) and the Camilist Union-National Liberation Army (Unión Camilista-Ejército de Liberación Nacional, UC-ELN) violate international humanitarian law by killing civilians, kidnaping for ransom and using indiscriminate weapons, including propane tank bombs. Half of the over 3,300 kidnapings registered in 2000 by País Libre, a non-governmental organization that advocates an end to this violation, were attributed to guerrillas. Both guerrilla groups continued to use child soldiers. Sample Questions for Presidents Bush and Pastrana: Questions for President Pastrana: President Pastrana, you have announced three times the formation of a high-level government task force to target paramilitary groups. Yet there are no visible results despite the fact that information on the location, identity, vehicles and even telephone numbers of paramilitaries is widely known and is in the hands of the authorities. Indeed, most observers agree that the paramilitaries have gained strength over the last year. When will the government show real results in this fight? President Pastrana, you have vowed to get tough on military officers who work with paramilitary groups. Yet officers against who there is credible evidence of tolerating and working with paramilitary groups, including Colonel Gabriel Díaz, remain on active duty. What are the obstacles to dismissing these officers? Questions for President Bush: In August 2000, President Bill Clinton invoked a waiver that allowed the U.S. government to send military aid to Colombia despite the fact that the Colombian military had not complied with human rights conditions, and continued to maintain close ties with the paramilitary groups responsible for most human rights violations in Colombia. Does you support Clinton's use of the waiver? (If President Bush does support the use of the waiver.) Please explain how requiring the Colombian military to uphold human rights protections threatens the national security interest of the United States.","Americas, Colombia, United States",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/01/31/human-rights-watch-comments-greek-immigration-bill","Human Rights Watch Comments on Greek Immigration Bill","Human Rights Watch Comments on Greek Immigration Bill","","01/31/2001","Dear Member of Parliament:     Human Rights Watch is writing in regard to the immigration bill currently under consideration by the Greek parliament. We recognize that the bill's intent is to improve upon past laws regarding the residence and employment of foreigners in Greece, and to meet the challenge of managing migration into the country. However, we are deeply concerned that provisions of the draft bill are in violation of Greece's international and regional human rights obligations. We are also concerned that the transitional provisions providing for a second """"regularization process"""" for undocumented migrants may result in serious fundamental rights violations related to procedural guarantees and the detention of foreigners. Human Rights Watch includes in this letter a critique of key provisions of the draft bill and suggests amendments and changes to the draft that bring the bill into conformity with Greece's obligations under European and international law.  Prohibition against discrimination. In its current form, the draft immigration bill does not include an anti-discrimination provision. We understand that prior drafts of the bill included provisions prohibiting discrimination against migrants on grounds of race or religion, and guaranteeing migrants legally residing in Greece equal treatment with Greek nationals in access to vocational training and the right to freedom of association. These provisions were deleted from the current draft. We urge that a provision guaranteeing non-discrimination with respect to the rights enumerated in the draft law be included in the final bill in conformity with the well-established international norm prohibiting discrimination based on race, ethnic origin, religion, and other status. The inclusion of an anti-discrimination provision also complies with Greece's obligations as a member of the European Union under Council of the European Union Directive 2000/43/EC (Race Directive) implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin. The directive, now part of the """"acquis communautaire""""-the body of law governing membership in the European Union-requires all member states to conform their legislation to implement the directive's anti-discrimination principles within three years. The directive prohibits direct and indirect discrimination in both the public and private sectors based on race or ethnic origin and applies to access to employment; vocational training and working conditions; membership in trade unions; social advantages; social security and health care; education; and to the provision of goods and services available to the public, including housing. The directive specifically includes third country nationals within its scope, notwithstanding a government's right to differential treatment based strictly on legal status.      Article 1: Stateless Persons. Article 1 of the draft bill defines those persons to whom the law applies, including those without a nationality (stateless persons). Human Rights Watch strongly recommends that Article 1(a) be amended to state that """"An alien is every person who does not hold the Greek nationality or a person that does not have a nationality (stateless), in accordance with the 1954 Convention on the Status of Stateless Persons.""""      Article 5: Entry of Refugees/Asylum Seekers. The draft bill requires that all persons seeking entry into Greece carry valid documentation, including a passport, other recognized travel document, and, where required, a visa. Article 5(5) provides for """"exceptional cases"""" in which authorities at entry points may provide a visa upon authorization by the Minister of Public Order, but makes no specific reference to refugees and asylum seekers, many of whom are forced to leave their countries under urgent and extreme circumstances and are often unable to obtain travel documents prior to departure. For purposes of clarification, the article should state that persons with a well-founded fear of persecution if they are returned to their country of origin and those in need of international protection should be exempt from the requirement to provide such documentation. This exemption brings the draft bill into conformity with Article 31 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees which prohibits the punishment of refugees for illegal entry into the country of asylum if the refugee travels directly from his or her country of origin and reports to the authorities in the country of destination without delay. The article should also contain specific reference to the fact that asylum seekers may lodge an application for asylum at any entry point (including in transit zones per Article 6 of the draft bill) as provided for in Presidential Decree 61/1991. Clarification regarding the rights of refugees and asylum seekers with respect to proper documentation and applying for asylum should also be incorporated at Article 7: Denial of Entry. Moreover, Human Rights Watch strongly recommends that Law 1975/1991 and Presidential Decree 61/1991 are reviewed and, if necessary, strengthened to comply in full with the 1951 Refugee Convention and relevant UNHCR guidelines.      Article 19: Granting of Labor Permits. Human Rights Watch urges that work permits not be tied to a specific employer as required by the draft bill at Article 19(1). We have documented cases of serious abuse in labor sectors where such an exclusive relationship exists between employee and employer. For example, in November 2000, we interviewed numerous migrant women who worked as domestics in Greek households. Many women held a work permit that allowed them to work only for one employer. Yet many of these women had experienced severe abuse (e.g. physical and verbal abuse; restrictions on freedom of movement; labor rights violations, including nonpayment of wages, long hours, and poor working conditions) at the hands of their employers. The women did not feel that they could leave their jobs because they were authorized only to work for one employer and feared they would not be able to acquire documents to work for another. In many cases, the abusive employer had confiscated their documents, leaving them vulnerable to deportation as undocumented migrants. We therefore recommend that work permits be keyed to particular labor sectors where there is a documented need for migrant labor (e.g. domestics) thus allowing migrants to change employers if their work conditions are abusive.      Article 28: Family Reunification. Article 28(1) of the draft bill requires that aliens must reside legally in Greece for two years before applying to have family members join them. Article 12(1) of the European Convention on the Legal Status of Migrant Workers (1977)-to which Greece is a signatory-states that the waiting period required before family reunification may commence """"shall not exceed twelve months."""" The October 2000 European Commission proposal for a Council Directive on Family Reunification also adopts the twelve month waiting period. We urge that the draft immigration bill adopt one-year as the maximum residency requirement for migrants wishing to exercise their right to family reunification. With respect to Article 28(2) of the draft bill, we also urge that the categories of family members eligible for family reunification with a third country national legally resident in Greece be expanded to cover a broader range of persons in order to ensure that family integrity is authentically preserved. To this end, we recommend that the draft bill be amended to state that a migrant's family members for the purposes of reunification include her/his spouse or partner in a relationship producing the effect of marriage, and that family members in the ascending line who are dependent financially and emotionally on the migrant be eligible for reunification.      Chapter VIII-Employment in Entertainment Centres: Nexus with Trafficking. Chapter VIII of the bill, although couched in language related to """"artists"""" and their employment in """"entertainment centres"""", includes within its scope the employment of migrant women in bars, nightclubs, and other venues. This chapter, however, makes no mention at all of the increasingly serious problem of trafficking of women and children into Greece for forced prostitution and other forms of forced labor. In our view, the entire chapter should be reconstructed taking into particular consideration the phenomenon of trafficking. Trafficking in women for forced prostitution in Greece has increased sharply in recent years, yet Greece has no laws specifically criminalizing trafficking in persons. Trafficking primarily affects migrant women. Traffickers often deceive women about the conditions of the work they will do once they arrive in Greece, and in some cases club owners threaten migrant women with forced deportation and violence if they do not cooperate. While some women trafficked into Greece know that they will work in the sex industry, they do not know and cannot know that they will be forced into debt bondage and servitude. Human Rights Watch's November 2000 research mission to Greece uncovered serious trafficking abuses. We also discovered, however, that the absence of laws on trafficking, coupled with a profound lack of coordination among government law enforcement agencies, failed to provide trafficking victims with any consistent, effective protection from traffickers and their networks, which often include the very entertainment centers referred to in the draft bill. Human Rights Watch strongly recommends that Chapter VIII be rewritten to include explicit reference to anti-trafficking initiatives; provisions for the effective prosecution of migrant traffickers; and, in particular, special protective measures for trafficking victims, including witness protection for persons who agree to testify against traffickers, safe passage home to their country of origin if possible, the ability to apply for asylum, and the possibility of permission to stay in Greece for humanitarian reasons or victims of trafficking who have suffered the most severe forms of abuse at the hands of traffickers. The inclusion of such measures would indicate that Greece is in step with the December 2000 proposals by the European Commission to combat trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children; the November 2000 Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Ministerial Decision calling for enhanced efforts at the OSCE level to combat trafficking in human beings; and global efforts to address trafficking via the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime and its Protocol on Trafficking in Human Beings.      Article 39: Granting a Residence Permit. Article 39(4)(b) should make explicit reference to the provision in Greek law for temporary protection status for those in need of international protection. Relevant provisions of law 1975/1991 and Presidential Decree 61/1991 providing for temporary protection status will remain in force when the new immigration bill becomes law (see also general recommendation regarding review of refugee protection legislation in Greece under """"Article 5"""" above).      Article 41: Rights of Aliens. Article 41 states that """"[a]liens legally residing in Greek territory enjoy fundamental human rights provided for by domestic law, international conventions, and general principles of law."""" Human Rights Watch strongly urges parliamentarians to recognize that most fundamental human rights, as articulated by the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR) and guaranteed by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), apply to """"all persons"""" despite their nationality or legal status within a particular country. Thus, in conformity with Greece's international and regional obligations, it is critical to add language to this article acknowledging that all migrants-those legally resident and those with an irregular status-enjoy fundamental human rights guarantees which the Greek state is required to protect. These rights include, but are not limited to, the right to life; freedom from torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment; the prohibition against slavery and servitude; security of person; procedural guarantees; the prohibition against arbitrary detention; freedom of religion and expression; and the prohibition against discrimination. The free exercise of these rights and protection against basic human rights violations are essential for migrants in cases of police abuse, racist and xenophobic violence, and ill-treatment in detention. In cases where such abuses occur, any migrant-including undocumented migrants-should enjoy the full protection of the Greek state and have effective recourse in the criminal justice and judicial systems for abuses suffered. All too often, migrants attempting to bring claims before public authorities for human rights violations are detained as a matter of first course and deported at the state's earliest convenience without any consideration at all of their claims of abuse.      Article 42: Access to Education. This provision requires that migrant children seeking to enter public school must provide documentation equivalent to that required for attendance by Greek nationals. Exceptions are made for refugee children, children of asylum seekers, and """"those coming from areas where an irregular situation is prevalent."""" The requirement of valid documentation is an effective bar to school attendance for children of undocumented or irregular migrants. This provision is a direct violation of Greece's obligations under the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child which requires that states parties take measures to ensure that children are not discriminated against on the basis of the status of their parents (Article 2) and that states parties """"make primary education compulsory and available free to all"""" (Article 28). Moreover, the exceptions noted above should be more precise and thus include child asylum seekers who are unaccompanied minors, children with special humanitarian status, and children under the temporary protection regime in accordance with Article 25(6) of Law 1975/1991.      Article 46: Administrative Expulsion. There should be explicit reference in this provision to the situation of migrants who cannot be returned to their home countries due to on-going conflict, lack of diplomatic relations, and other obstacles to speedy return. This provision should include language to the effect that deportation orders for migrants who cannot be deported shall be suspended pending periodic review of conditions in the deportee's home country and the possibility of executing the deportation order in the future (see also section below at """"Article 50"""" regarding alternatives to detention for migrants who cannot be deported).      Article 48: Prohibitions Against Expulsion. This article should explicitly prohibit collective expulsions and state that each deportation order must be issued and reviewed individually in conformity with internationally recognized procedural guarantees.      Article 50: Aliens' Detention Places. This provision should include language indicating that detention conditions for aliens must comply with international and regional standards for the treatment of detainees, including the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons Under Any Form of Detention, and the European Prison Rules. Human Rights Watch registers particular concern for those migrants held in detention who cannot return to their home countries due to conflict, lack of diplomatic relations, and other obstacles to speedy return. Their indefinite incarceration is a violation of the prohibition against arbitrary detention and it is incumbent on the Greek government to establish alternatives to arbitrary detention. The rights of aliens in detention should be posted in each detention facility in a variety of languages and should be explained to those detainees who cannot read. Moreover, it should be added that, in general, asylum seekers should not be detained. Asylum seekers should only be detained in exceptional circumstances, on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' Guidelines on Applicable Criteria and Standards Relating to the Detention of Asylum Seekers. It should also be stated that detained asylum seekers in Greece enjoy the right to contact UNHCR.      Article 51: Unwanted Aliens. The Ministry of Public Order maintains a list of """"unwanted aliens"""" who are presumptively denied legal entry or residence in Greece. The criteria for inclusion on the list are not published and not known. There also appears to be no official review process whereby a person whose name is included on the list can seek information regarding the criteria or challenge the inclusion of his or her name based on mistake or any other reason. When Human Rights Watch met with the Minister of Public Order in November 2000, he stated that any person aggrieved by the inclusion of his name on the list could simply write him a letter and he would look into it. The process surrounding establishment and maintenance of the Greek national list should be formalized and transparent. Thus, criteria for inclusion on the list and an official review process should be included in the bill. Moreover, the list should not be used to obstruct a person's right to seek asylum in conformity with Article 14(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which endorses the right of any individual to seek and enjoy asylum from persecution. Refusing entry to asylum seekers could exclude them from the international protection they need and may amount to a violation of the fundamental principle of nonrefoulement-the duty of states not to return any person to a country where their life or freedom is at risk.      Article 53: Public Sector Sanctions. Article 53(1) of the draft bill states that public sector employees """"are obliged not to afford their services to aliens unable to prove legal residence status in Greece"""" and levels disciplinary and criminal penalties against those who do provide such services. Hospitals, clinics and treatment facilities are exempt from this prohibition in cases where aliens require emergency treatment. However, """"emergency treatment"""" is not defined and leaves open the possibility that persons in need of routine health care (e.g. pregnant women and children with serious conditions that could hinder development) that provides a critical preventive function or the maintenance of a potentially life-threatening condition may be denied such care based on their irregular status. Furthermore, Article 6(2) of the 1989 U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) requires that states parties """"ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child."""" Article 24 of the CRC guarantees children access to """"facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health"""" and mandates that governments """"strive to ensure that no child is deprived of his or her right of access to such health services."""" Article 53 of the draft law should thus contain language guaranteeing that any restrictions on access to health care or medical treatment must be in conformity with the most basic of human rights guarantees-the right to life. It should also explicitly exempt all children from any restrictions on their access to health care and medical treatment. In addition, the article prohibits """"legal persons of public law"""" from affording migrants their services. It is unclear precisely what legal actors are included in this category. This provision should explicitly provide that migrants (whatever their status) have equal access to the criminal justice system and criminal and civil courts for recourse for crimes committed against them and the right to lodge civil claims for labor rights violations (e.g. nonpayment of wages for work completed). Such claims should be heard in the courts or before administrative tribunals before an order of deportation is executed against an undocumented migrant.      Article 56: Private Sector Sanctions. Although hospitals, clinics, and treatment facilities may provide emergency care to persons without valid documentation, Article 56(2) requires directors of hotels, resorts, clinics and treatment facilities, and """"any other personnel in any way providing shelter to an alien"""" to inform the police if an alien is residing in their facilities. This reporting requirement could serve as a bar to persons in need of emergency shelter or specialized (i.e. life-saving) medical treatment and could result in threats to their safety and health. It also has serious implications for charitable, humanitarian and nongovernmental organizations that provide essential services (e.g. the provision of food and shelter) to the disadvantaged, including undocumented migrants. Private actors should not be enlisted by the state to act in a migration control capacity and this reporting requirement should be struck from the draft bill.      Article 57: Carriers' Sanctions. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and many nongovernmental organizations, including Human Rights Watch, have expressed concern that the imposition of sanctions on carriers for bringing in passengers without valid passports and visas has the effect of engaging private companies in the exercise of immigration control functions. Private transport companies in fear of heavy penalties are put in a position where they-not the state-are making determinations about the validity of passengers' documents. Personnel of carrier companies thus serve as proxies for border and passport control personnel without any obligations to protect human rights, or the benefit of any training or expertise in migration control or human rights and refugee protection. The carriers' sanctions regime thus has serious implications for the right of refugees to international protection and the right to seek asylum. As noted above, many asylum seekers flee their countries under extreme circumstances which compel them to travel without valid documents. Article 31 of the 1951 Refugee Convention recognizes that asylum seekers often will not possess valid travel documentation and prohibits the punishment of refugees for illegal entry into the country of asylum if the refugee travels directly from his or her country of origin and reports to the authorities in the country of destination without delay. Carriers' sanctions thus can serve as an effective bar to the right to leave one's country and to seek refuge from persecution in another country. Thus, Human Rights Watch strongly urges that Article 57 be omitted from the final version of the immigration bill.      Chapter XV: Transitional Provisions. Human Rights Watch acknowledges that the transitional provisions (i.e. regularization process) of the draft law will provide an opportunity for some undocumented migrants now illegally residing in Greece to gain legal status. However, these provisions contain many requirements-for example, proof of continuous residence for two years up to November 15, 2000-that most irregular migrants currently in Greece will not be able to provide. Minister of the Interior Vasso Papandreou has stated publicly that those migrants who cannot meet the requirements of the regularization process """"will simply have to leave."""" Human Rights Watch is concerned that the government's demand that migrants who cannot utilize the regularization process can simply depart Greece is not only unrealistic but may give rise to abuses in the government's future migration control efforts. In its 2000 World Report, Human Rights Watch reported that the Greek police routinely conducted discriminatory """"sweeps"""" of areas where immigrants live and gather, detained large groups of foreigners-including those with valid residence permits and asylum seekers-and detained them in police stations or sports facilities for long periods of time. Undocumented migrants were summarily expelled from Greece. In a personal meeting in November 2000, we expressed our concerns to the Minister of Public Order regarding the indiscriminate targeting of foreigners and the procedural violations that characterized these sweeps (which, according to local nongovernmental organizations, continue). The Minister's responses were unsatisfactory. He admitted that the sweeps took place in precisely the manner as reported by nongovernmental organizations and that hundreds of Albanian migrants were expelled in a July 1999 """"sweep."""" He failed to recognize the indiscriminate nature of the operations or the fact that collective expulsions violate individual procedural guarantees. Moreover, in December 2000, Human Rights Watch sent an urgent memorandum to the Greek government detailing the appalling conditions of detention for foreigners awaiting deportation in Greek police stations. Conditions of detention at the Alexandras Avenue detention facility for foreigners violated nearly every international and regional standard for the treatment of detainees. Human Rights Watch thus urges the Ministry of Public Order and the Ministry of the Interior to address the issue of irregular migration by strictly adhering to Greece's international and regional human rights obligations. In particular, we call for a halt to discriminatory police sweeps; the protection of procedural guarantees for those detained under the laws pertaining to aliens; the enhanced protection of asylum seekers and refugees; and adherence to basic minimum standards of treatment for foreign detainees, including the prohibition against arbitrary detention.     Human Rights Watch will be monitoring the immigration bill as it proceeds to passage. We would be happy to discuss our concerns with you at your convenience.     Sincerely,         Holly Cartner   Executive Director   Europe and Central Asia Division","Europe/Central Asia, Greece","Children's Rights, Refugees and Migrants, Women's Rights, Migrant and Refugee Children, Asylum Seekers, Migrants"
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/01/31/backgrounder-democratic-republic-congo","Backgrounder on the Democratic Republic of the Congo","Backgrounder on the Democratic Republic of the Congo","","01/31/2001","Joseph Kabila, newly installed president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has inherited an intractable war, a near void of civil institutions, and a legacy of human rights abuses committed under the rule of his father, the late President Laurent Kabila. The new president has tried to spark renewed peace discussions and has stirred hope for improvements on the domestic political front. He has promised new respect for civil liberties and has ordered legislation to be drafted recognizing political parties. He has established a commission to set terms for the national dialogue with other political forces, as specified in the Lusaka Accords.   During his nearly four years in power, former President Kabila regularly and ruthlessly violated the human rights of the Congolese people, killing, torturing, imprisoning, and causing the """"disappearance"""" of any who he thought threatened him or his regime. Among those who suffered most were political opponents, leaders of civil society, human rights activists, and journalists.   Joseph Kabila has promised to return to a state based on law but has not yet initiated any reform of civilian justice. Part of the action on this urgent question should include a review of persons currently detained in prison and the prompt release of those held without charge or credible suspicion of guilt.   The new president has promised improvements in the military justice system. The commission of inquiry established to investigate the assassination of the elder Kabila may show how likely this effort is to succeed. The assassin, reportedly shot dead immediately after the crime, was said to have been part of the Kadogo unit and several other soldiers from that unit have been arrested. Kadogo, a term which means child soldier, refers to a unit of soldiers recruited when they were very young, many of them from the eastern provinces of the Kivus. If Kabila can ensure an orderly, transparent inquiry into the sensitive issue of his father's death, his commitment to improving military justice will gain credibility.   A number of sometimes competing security services operated during the time of the elder Kabila. Joseph Kabila reportedly forced the resignation of the heads of these services for their """"incompetence and failures"""" in preventing the assassination of his father. He should also order investigations of how these services violated the basic rights of ordinary Congolese, particularly by making arbitrary arrests and by ill-treating and torturing detainees. For the rule of law to materialize, those responsible must be held accountable for their abuses.   Kabila has ordered a tightening of military discipline, but it is not clear if this involves new orders for troops to henceforth observe the Rules of war. During the 1996-1997 war which put Laurent Kabila in power, Congolese soldiers and their Rwandan and Ugandan allies attacked tens of thousands of civilians, slaughtering, raping, and otherwise injuring them, and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes. The U.N. made two efforts to document these war crimes but failed to complete their work, in part because of obstruction by the elder Kabila. After the team of experts appointed by the Secretary General delivered a report implicating Congolese and Rwandan soldiers in crimes against humanity and possible genocide, the U.N. Security Council charged the Congolese and Rwandan governments with carrying forward the investigation. Neither did so. Were Kabila to signal clear readiness to facilitate the work of a new international investigation, he would begin to substantiate his proclaimed commitment to justice. Presumably any new international investigation would also address violations of international humanitarian law during the current conflict.   During the course of the war, some of the national belligerents have meddled in local ethnic-based conflicts, often delivering the arms and military training that made such combat even more lethal.

Over the weekend of January 27-28, 2001, supporters of the opposition party the Civic United Front (CUF) planned a peaceful demonstration to protest last year's flawed elections. The CUF enjoys widespread support on the semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. Before the rallies could get underway, the government reportedly responded by shooting indiscriminately into crowds and using clubs to beat demonstrators on Zanzibar and Pemba islands.

""""The security forces must be held accountable for their brutality against unarmed people.""""  The president of Zanzibar, Amani Abeid Karume spoke on television on January 28, congratulating the police for their efforts and warning those involved in the demonstration that the government will punish all those who took part. He did not call on the police to end their rampage, nor did he state that security forces who have used unrestrained force would be held responsible for their actions. """"The crackdown on Pemba and Zanzibar and the statement made by President Karume are unacceptable,"""" said Peter Takirambudde. Human Rights Watch also has received reports indicating that a police helicopter attacked several boats that were attempting to transport injured people to Mombasa, Kenya, to obtain medical care. At least one boat was sunk and an unknown number of people died.  According to credible information from local organizations, the government deployed hundreds of police. In addition to shooting unarmed civilians and beating people, security forces are reported to have blocked access to a hospital, denying the wounded medical care. Police are allegedly dragging people from their houses at night and from the hospital wards, and beating or jailing them in overcrowded police cells where conditions are now dismal. The security forces have forced people into their homes and harassed people found in the streets.  On January 26, 2001, the CUF chairman, Ibrahim Lipumba, was charged in capital city Dar-es-Salaam, with unlawful assembly and disturbing the peace along with fifteen other CUF members.  Human Rights Watch called on the president to punish the security force members who have attacked unarmed people.

The children are employed under the authority of the Agriculture Ministry, and the Egyptian government has a responsibility to ensure compliance with the country's 1996 Child Law.  """"Egypt's Child Law was an important step forward, but its labor standards are not being applied to children working for the cooperatives,"""" said Lois Whitman, executive director of the Children's Rights division of Human Rights Watch. """"The way children are treated in the cotton fields is deplorable.""""  The twenty-page report, """"Underage and Unprotected: Child Labor in Egypt's Cotton Fields,"""" documents conditions faced by more than one million rural children who are hired each year from May to July, largely during the school recess, to control cotton leafworm infestations. Working eleven hours a day, seven days a week, the children inspect cotton plants for leafworm eggs and manually remove infected portions of leaves. An agricultural engineer assigned to one of the cooperatives told Human Rights Watch that children were cheaper to hire, more obedient, and had the """"appropriate height"""" for inspecting cotton plants.  The children's working hours far exceed the maximum six hours per day for which they may be employed under the Child Law. A majority of the children are between the ages of seven and twelve. They earn on average three Egyptian pounds (about one U.S. dollar) each day. Temperatures in Nile Delta cotton fields can reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit). Requests for water are granted at the discretion of the foremen.  Nearly all of the children whom Human Rights Watch interviewed recounted routine beatings with wooden switches by foremen whenever a child was perceived to be slowing down or overlooking leaves.  Human Rights Watch also found that children resumed work on cotton fields either immediately after pesticide spraying or after twenty-four to forty-eight hours, a period that falls short of the recommended intervals for reentry after the use of certain pesticides registered for use in Egypt. Human Rights Watch welcomed the agriculture ministry's recent establishment of """"learning groups"""" to educate farmers about pest management methods. It noted that the ministry had made significant strides in recent years to reduce the volume of pesticides applied on cotton, and had banned the use of several categories of hazardous pesticides. In its report, Human Rights Watch called on the government of Egypt to: uphold its minimum age for seasonal agricultural employment and limits on working hours for children, monitor the treatment of children engaged in leafworm control operations, take disciplinary action against foremen found to have mistreated children in their care,, establish """"reentry intervals"""" that reflect children's greater susceptibility to pesticide absorption and retention, and monitor spraying by farmers, restrict the availability of pesticides considered highly hazardous by the World Health Organization. Under a 1965 agriculture ministry decree, farmers are required to provide at least one child to the local cooperative for paid leafworm control work. Although that decree no longer appears to be enforced, Human Rights Watch noted that it had a potentially coercive effect and called for its formal repeal in the report. The report released today is the second issued recently by Human Rights Watch on child agricultural labor. In a report issued in June 2000, Fingers to the Bone: United States Failure to Protect Child Farmworkers, Human Rights Watch found that there are hundreds of thousands of children and teenagers working as hired farm labor in the United States They risk pesticide poisoning, heat illness, and injuries, and receive fewer protections under U.S. law than children working in non-agricultural settings.

Human Rights Watch opposes the use of the death penalty in all cases as a violation of the right to life, both because of its inherent cruelty, and because of the possibility that individuals wrongly convicted may be executed. We are therefore deeply disturbed by the Palestinian Authority's repeated recourse to the death penalty in cases where defendants received grossly unfair trials before state security and military courts whose verdicts may have been influenced by political considerations.  Public executions, such as the execution of Allam Bani Ouda in front of a crowd of thousands in Nablus, are particularly repulsive and cruel.

The speed with which convictions were issued in these latest cases, after military court trials which lasted only a few hours and where the accused had no access to legal representation or appeal, shows convincingly that the defendants' most basic due process rights were violated.  At a minimum, all suspects tried before any Palestinian court should be provided with the following internationally recognized rights:  to be presumed innocent until proven guilty; to be tried before a competent, independent, and impartial tribunal;  to be informed of the nature and basis of the charges against him or her;  to have adequate time to prepare a defense, to present a defense to the charges, and call witnesses in their defense;  to be provided with legal representation, if necessary paid by the state;  to examine the evidence and the witnesses against him or her;  not to be compelled to testify against himself or herself, or to confess guilt; and,  to appeal conviction and sentence to a higher tribunal according to law.  Noting that these basic minimum rights were not provided to the convicted persons, we urge Your Excellency to stay the execution of those pending death sentences and to require an immediate retrial which meets the minimum international fair trial standards enumerated above.  It is a matter of deep concern to Human Rights Watch that the Palestinian Authority continues to defy the worldwide trend towards the abolition of the death penalty by handing down death sentences and carrying out executions.

The defendant, charged with kidnaping and murder by investigating judge Juan Guzman, now faces arrest, fingerprinting, and other police procedures. """"Pinochet's indictment shows that no one is above the law in Chile,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas division. """"It attests to the strength of Chilean democracy, and it's a tremendous advance for justice everywhere.""""     Pinochet's lawyers are expected to challenge the charges today before the summer panel of the Santiago Appeals Court. They have been pressing for the case to be closed because of Pinochet's medical condition (the general, who is 85, suffers from ailments including diabetes and the after-effects of minor strokes). Pinochet underwent medical tests from January 10-12, which reportedly found that he suffered from a degree of mental impairment. Under Chilean law, however, a defendant must be found insane to escape prosecution.     Judge Juan Guzman had previously charged Pinochet with murder and kidnapping on December 1, 2000. The Santiago Appeals Court threw out the charges on the grounds that the judge had failed to question Pinochet, a requirement under Chilean law before a person may be charged with a criminal offense, and the Supreme Court confirmed the ruling. Judge Guzman pressed on with the case, finally questioning Pinochet at his Santiago home on January 23.     The Chilean courts have had to overcome numerous obstacles left in place by the military government to ensure that it would never be held responsible for human rights atrocities committed after the 1973 coup. In January 1998, when Judge Guzman opened his investigation, few observers gave him any chance of success as, among other things, an amnesty law prevented prosecutions for crimes committed between 1973 and 1978.     In 1999, however, the courts ruled that """"disappearances"""" must be considered ongoing crimes and were therefore not subject to the law. The Chilean Supreme Court's August 2000 decision confirming the removal of Pinochet's parliamentary immunity gave further support to this doctrine.     """"The tenacity with which Judge Guzman has pursued the case is admirable,"""" said Vivanco.

Israeli officials have argued that during periods of armed conflict such individuals are legitimate military targets. Responding to questions about Israel's first acknowledged """"liquidation"""" under this policy, the head of the IDF's International Law Branch, Col. Daniel Reisner, said on November 15, 2000, """"In the current situation, people who attack us have been identified by us as combatants. As a result we view them as legitimate targets. That's what I mean by targeting. That specific individual falls under that category, therefore he was attacked and killed."""" Shortly thereafter, Deputy Minister of Defense Ephraim Sneh announced that """"the security cabinet gave the green light Thursday [November 23] to a series of operations to prevent attacks and punish those who ordered them."""" The unanimous decision reportedly gives you, as Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, the authority to order military operations without security cabinet approval. Although your government has not made public the terms of this authority, the January 8, 2000 Washington Post reported that Deputy Minister Sneh explicitly acknowledged a policy of """"liquidations,"""" saying """"I can tell you unequivocally what the policy is. If anyone has committed or is planning to carry out terrorist attacks, he has to be hit. . . . It is effective, precise and just."""" Although Israel has not made public the names of those killed pursuant to this policy, at least nine such killings have taken place since early November, according to Israeli and Palestinian human rights organizations, and some press accounts refer to the existence of a list of one hundred potential targets for """"liquidation."""" Israel's failure to make public detailed information on its policy of """"liquidation"""" of specific individuals is particularly troubling given that at least one of the persons Israel acknowledges killing under the policy, Thabit Ahmad Thabit, was a senior official in the Palestinian Ministry of Health and secretary-general of Fateh's Tulkarem branch, both clearly civilian posts. IDF snipers killed Thabit while he was leaving his house in Tulkarem on December 31, 2000. According to the Israeli human rights group, B'Tselem, a Palestinian eyewitness described two to three minutes of continuous shooting at Thabit's car as he backed out of his driveway. Thabit had worked closely with Israeli peace activists for more than a decade, and had been credited with arranging the safe return of some twenty Israeli soldiers who apparently blundered into Palestinian-controlled Tulkarem on October 20, 2000. Israeli officials have alleged that Thabit was involved in planning attacks on Israelis, but have not made public any evidence to substantiate this allegation. The need for investigations is also highlighted by a number of cases where Israeli officials have denied that the victims were killed under the """"liquidation"""" policy, but where the circumstances of the killings are highly suspicious. One such case is that of Anwar Ahmad Hamran, an Islamic Jihad activist who had served time in Israeli prisons and had recently been released from Palestinian Authority custody; he was killed in Nablus on December 11, 2000. According to B'Tselem, a taxi driver who was five meters away from Hamran when he was killed described the shots as coming from the direction of the Mt. Grizim IDF outpost, some 300 meters away. The shooting, he said, continued for approximately twenty minutes, and prevented a Palestinian Red Crescent ambulance from reaching Hamran. The driver said there was no demonstration or shooting in the area prior to the attack, and Hamran, a student at al-Quds University, had books and notebooks in his hands when he was shot. According to press accounts, IDF officials speaking on the day of the killing denied that Hamran's killing was part of """"a planned operation,"""" and alleged that soldiers were responding to Palestinian gunfire from an area outside of Nablus: """"It wasn't any kind of special action. The soldiers simply saw him armed moving in an area where he shouldn't have been, obviously planning to carry out an attack."""" Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh reportedly said, """"if a man from the Islamic Jihad, an organization which is sowing wholesale death in our cities, has left our world, it is not a reason to party, but definitely a reason to rejoice."""" In other suspicious killings, Israel has alleged that its security forces killed Palestinians while attempting to arrest them, despite evidence suggesting that the killings may have been summary executions or the result of excessive use of lethal force. For example, Israeli soldiers killed Hamas activist Hani Husayn Hassan Abu Bakr in highly contentious circumstances. Abu Bakr, who worked as the driver of a shared taxi, was killed at a temporary checkpoint near the Gush Katif settlement bloc in Gaza on December 14, 2000, when IDF soldiers opened fire on the taxi he was driving. According to the IDF spokesperson, an IDF unit """"on an operational activity"""" attempted to arrest Abu Bakr at the checkpoint and then opened fire after Abu Bakr """"tried to fire the revolver that was in his possession."""" According to the Palestinian Center for Human Rights, however, Palestinian eyewitnesses deny that Abu Bakr had a gun. The witnesses said that a group of soldiers had surrounded the parked taxi and asked for Abu Bakr's identity card. When Abu Bakr reached for his identity card, they said, soldiers in an adjacent tank opened fire on the taxi, and the soldiers who had surrounded the taxi then joined in the firing. We note that Israel has previously adopted policies that disregarded essential safeguards against summary execution. In 1993 Human Rights Watch documented a pattern of killings of """"wanted"""" Palestinians by Israeli special-forces units, and a failure by IDF and Ministry of Justice officials to investigate and prosecute such killings (A License to Kill: Israeli Undercover Operations against """"Wanted"""" and Masked Palestinians). In thirteen of the twenty cases we documented, Israeli undercover agents killed individuals who were neither armed nor """"wanted""""; in four of these cases, the victims were killed after unwittingly falling into an ambush for """"wanted"""" persons. Human Rights Watch is concerned that the present policy of """"liquidations,"""" like the previous policy of killing """"wanted"""" suspects, is in essence a policy of killing without public accountability. Further, we are concerned that it creates a climate in which IDF personnel may resort to lethal force in other cases where non-lethal means of apprehending suspects are available. For these reasons we urge you to halt the policy immediately, and to conduct a full review of the measures taken to ensure that no civilians are deliberately targeted. In addition, we urge the government of Israel to:     * Acknowledge responsibility for and make public all cases of individuals killed or wounded to date as a result of the """"liquidation"""" policy.       Make public the factual basis and supporting evidence for the decision to eliminate these individuals.     * Reveal the level of command authorized to order a """"liquidation,"""" the process for reviewing such orders, and the person or body ultimately accountable for these actions.     * Establish a commission of inquiry to investigate all killings carried out under the policy to establish whether the persons killed were in fact legitimate military targets, whether it would have been possible to prevent their participation in combat by non-lethal means, and whether steps were taken to minimize injury to civilians and civilian property. The full findings of the commission should be made public. Anyone responsible for wrongdoing should be brought to justice or disciplined, and the victims compensated.

A court set up by the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) sentenced Joao Fernandes, 22, to twelve years in prison on Thursday. The three judges on the panel were from East Timor, Italy, and Burundi. Fernandes, a member of the Dadurus Merah Putih militia, admitted to having murdered a village chief who had sought refuge in the police station in Maliana, near the West Timor border, in early September 1999. Some forty people were subsequently massacred in the police station.  """"This trial is important because it means the courts are finally functioning, and the backlog of cases is finally being cleared,"""" said Joe Saunders, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch. """"But all the key perpetrators of the 1999 violence remain in Indonesia, and prosecutions there are totally stalled.""""  In East Timor, some fifty mostly low-ranking militia members have been detained, some for more than a year. It has been a source of great frustration inside East Timor that justice has proceeded so slowly. The courts had to be created from scratch last year, and the investigation process has been plagued by inadequate training of investigators, changes in administrative structure, and lack of resources and personnel.  Saunders pointed out that Fernandes was sentenced on ordinary murder charges, not crimes against humanity. In order to make a case for the latter, Dili-based investigators need to prove that the 1999 violence was part of a larger plan or policy, and critical evidence rests with witnesses on the Indonesian side of the border.  Major obstacles remain to justice in Indonesian courts. While it announced a list of suspects on September 1, 1999, the Indonesian government has made no move to issue indictments against them, let alone arrest warrants. A key militia leader, Eurico Gutteres, is on trial in Jakarta, but on charges that have nothing to do with the 1999 violence. He has been embraced as a hero of national unity by several leading Jakarta politicians.  Moreover, the Indonesian Attorney-General's office has said that it will not proceed with indictments until an """"ad hoc"""" human rights court is set up under legislation passed last November. For those courts to be established, the Indonesian parliament must make a formal request to the president, and it shows no inclination to do so.  """"There has been no evidence -- in either Jakarta or Dili -- of a systematic strategy to prosecute the top militia commanders or the Indonesian officers behind them,"""" Saunders said.  He noted that January 31, 2001 marks the first anniversary of a report by an international commission of inquiry on East Timor, appointed by the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, that called for an international tribunal to prosecute likely crimes against humanity. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, on receiving the report, said the Indonesian investigative process should be given a chance to work first.

University students and women have been among the most vocal groups supporting President Mohammad Khatami's reformist agenda, which includes relaxing some of the more severe restrictions imposed on Iranian women. The Guardian Council is closely allied with his more conservative opponents.

Qatar also is not a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, nor to any other bilateral or multilateral consular accord, which raises most serious issues in cases of detention of foreign nationals. The decision to meet in Qatar would look like an effort by the WTO to avoid the noisy demonstrations of the past year by picking a country that bans demonstrations.

The emirate of Qatar unfortunately is not one of these countries. By holding the meeting in Qatar, the WTO would send a chilling message to the international community regarding its respect for human rights and transparency. Freedom of assembly in Qatar is nonexistent, and the right to freedom of association is sharply circumscribed. The U.S. State Department, in its annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices published in February 2000, noted that Qatar """"does not allow political demonstrations."""" The report further noted that Qatar """"severely limits freedom of association"""" and """"does not allow political parties or membership in international professional organizations critical of the Government or of any other Arab government."""" It also reported that security forces monitor the activities of private social, sports, trade, professional, and cultural societies. There are other issues of concern as well. Qatar is not a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the international treaty that guarantees basic freedoms of expression, assembly and association and due process protections. Qatar also is not a signatory to the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, nor to any other bilateral or multilateral consular accord, which raises most serious issues in cases of detention of foreign nationals. The decision to meet in Qatar would look like an effort by the WTO to avoid the noisy demonstrations of the past year by picking a country that bans demonstrations.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/01/23/iranian-women-blocked-overseas-education","Iranian Women Blocked from Overseas Education","Iranian Women Blocked from Overseas Education","Letter to the Guardian Council","01/23/2001","The Academic Freedom Committee of Human Rights Watch strongly protests the recent decision of the Guardian Council to preserve the discriminatory laws that deny women equal access to universities outside Iran. On January 7, 2001, the Majlis voted overwhelmingly to strike provisions of article 3 of the 1986 Law on Sending Students Abroad that currently require the permission of a male guardian (father or husband) to allow adult women to study abroad and bar single women from receiving governmental financial aid for continuing their higher education in foreign universities. These provisions discriminate against women, and in this particular case deny them equal access to higher education. As the government's representative noted during the Majlis proceedings, this law would only affect a small number of women, all of whom are adults and have demonstrated their academic and moral qualifications by progressing through the educational system of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The Majlis's action would have brought Iran closer to meetings its obligations under article 3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (""""ICCPR"""") and articles 2(2) and 3 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (""""ICESCR""""), which seek to ensure the legal equality of the sexes, as well as ICESCR article 13(2)(c), which states that """"Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all ?."""" The Guardian Council's rejection of the parliamentary vote to remove discriminatory provisions regarding access to foreign universities thus violates Iran's explicit obligations under these conventions to respect the equal rights of all its citizens, whether male or female, to pursue higher education.  The general requirement that Iranian women can leave their own country only with the permission of a male guardian, as applied to women students in the Law on Sending Students Abroad, is itself discriminatory. This requirement violates article 12 of the ICCPR, by which countries party to the covenant (including Iran) agree to allow their citizens to leave their own country subject only to restrictions """"necessary to protect national security, public order, public health or morals ?consistent with the other rights recognized in the present Covenant."""" The authoritative General Comments issued by the U.N. Human Rights Committee on this provision emphasize that """"the application of the restrictions permissible under article 12, paragraph 3, needs to be consistent with the other rights guaranteed in the Covenant and with the fundamental principles of equality and non-discrimination."""" The Human Rights Committee has """"on several occasions found that measures preventing women from moving freely or from leaving the country by requiring them to have the consent or the escort of a male person constitute a violation of article 12.""""  Furthermore, the Guardian Council's refusal to allow the government to extend financial assistance (such as the provision of foreign currencies at cheaper than market rates) on an equal basis to men and women students flies in the face of ICESCR article 13(2)(e), which states that in order to ensure the right of equal access to higher education, """"…an adequate fellowship system shall be established"""" by the states party to the Convention. The Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which authoritatively interprets the ICESCR's provisions, has explicitly held in its General Comments regarding article 13 that the requirement for the provision of fellowships and financial assistance should be read with the covenant's non-discrimination and equality provisions, and that scholarships """"should enhance equality of educational access."""" The actions of the Guardian Council perpetuate a legal barrier to the equal access of men and women to higher education and hobble the efforts of the Majlis to correct this injustice in keeping with Iran's international obligations.  The Guardian Council's decision is particularly disappointing because it reverses the great strides taken by the Islamic Republic of Iran in providing equal access to men and women at all levels of education, and contradicts the spirit of statements made by delegates of Iran's government in the context of the 1995 World Conference on Women, held in Beijing, and the process for implementing the commitments made there. We would like to draw your attention in particular to paragraph 35 of the Beijing Declaration, which commits states (including Iran) to """"Ensure women's equal access to economic resources, including land, credit, science and technology, vocational training, information, communication and markets, as a means to further the advancement and empowerment of women and girls ?.""""  In 1995, and again in 1998 and 2000, Iran's official delegations articulated Iran's commitment to the Beijing Declaration and to providing equal opportunities to Iranian women, particularly in terms of access to education. As Shahla Habibi, advisor on women's affairs to former President Rafsanjani, stated at Beijing in 1995: """"Islam views men and women, as two partners complementing and not competing with each other. They are equal in creation, human dignity, human rights, and responsibility towards welfare of the family as well as their society."""" In light of this commitment, we ask the Guardian Council to reconsider its decision and to cooperate with the Majlis and other organs of government in ridding the Iranian legal system of provisions discriminating against women in education.  Your Excellency, the Academic Freedom Committee includes 29 academics, administrators, and scholars from around the globe dedicated to the principles of academic freedom and equal access to education. We commend the Islamic Republic of Iran for its advances in promoting the education of women and girls. But we deplore the Guardian Council's decision to deny Iranian women the right to decide freely to pursue their education at universities outside Iran's borders is a grave disservice to Iran's reputation and its plans for social and economic progress. We urge the Guardian Council, therefore, to express its full and unequivocal commitment to the equal rights of Iran's citizens by revising those existing provisions of Iranian law that discriminate against women and their access to higher education.  Thank you for your consideration of this important and urgent matter. We look forward to your reply.

The Cuban Criminal Code contains a very broad definition of """"rebellion"""" that criminalizes a whole host of legitimate activities. The code's catch-all provision of """"other acts against state security"""" is also designed to allow politically-motivated prosecutions that violate defendants' basic rights to free expression and association.  """"The case of these Czech citizens shows just how flawed the Cuban Criminal Code is,"""" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch's Americas Division. """"Cuban laws provide cover for all kinds of human rights abuse.""""  Pilip, a former finance minister and current member of the lower house of the Czech parliament, and Bubenik, a former student leader, entered Cuba on January 8. On January 11, Pilip and Bubenik met with two independent journalists in the province of Ciego de Avila, Antonio Femen?s Echemend? and Roberto Valdivia Hern?dez, and were arrested the following day. The two Cuban journalists released a statement not long after the Czechs' arrest saying that they had met with Pilip and Bubenik to discuss the political, economic and social situation of their respective countries.  The Cuban authorities have become increasingly hostile toward the Czech Republic, particularly since the latter country began co-sponsoring a U.N. resolution condemning human rights abuses in Cuba. Relations between the two countries began to deteriorate with the fall of communism in then-Czechoslakia in late 1989, and the rise to power of former dissidents like Czech President Vaclav Havel. In 2000, the second straight year that the Czech Republic sponsored the Cuba resolution of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, the Cubans reacted by holding a 100,000-strong demonstration outside the Czech Embassy in Havana. Another session of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights begins this year on March 19 in Geneva.  Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, published an article on January 16 acknowledging that the two Czechs had been detained. The article made note of """"the infamous accusations [made] against Cuba in the Human Rights Commission,"""" asserting that the Czech authorities should offer its apologies to Cuba. It also accused the two Czechs of visiting Ciego de Avila in order to """"make subversive contacts with members of counterrevolutionary groupuscules.""""  The crime of """"rebellion"""" (rebeli?, article 98 of the Cuban Criminal Code) is punishable by seven to fifteen years' imprisonment, while that of """"other acts against the state security"""" (otros actos contra la seguridad del estado, article 125 of the Cuban Criminal Code) is reportedly punishable by up to twenty years' imprisonment.  Cuba's Repressive Machinery, Human Rights Watch's 1999 report on Cuba's legal system, offers a detailed analysis of Cuba's criminal code and procedures. The report describes how Cuban law unabashedly criminalizes nonviolent political dissent. Among other cases, it relates the prosecution of prominent dissidents Vladimiro Roca Ant?ez, Marta Beatriz Roque, Felix Bonne Carcas? and Ren?G?ez Manzano, who were convicted in March 1999 of """"other acts against state security"""" related to incitement of sedition, receiving sentences ranging from three-and-a-half years to five years in prison.

Officials of Zamfara state carried out a flogging of one hundred lashes as punishment for Magazu's having sex outside marriage, although an appeal against her conviction and sentence was pending. """"Nigerian officials rushed to impose this cruel and inhuman punishment and ignored the court's review of Magazu's conviction and sentence,"""" said Regan E. Ralph, executive director of the Women's Rights division of Human Rights Watch. """"Corporal punishment is never defensible, and it's particularly offensive here, where a young girl has been charged with a crime because she gave birth,"""" added Ralph.  Magazu, in her early teens, was sentenced to 180 lashes in September 2000 by an Islamic court in the northern Nigerian state of Zamfara. Zamfara state, together with other northern Nigerian states, has recently extended the application of Islamic Sharia law to include such punishments. Magazu was found guilty of having sex outside marriage and bringing false charges upon the men she allegedly had sex with. Last week, the court reduced the conviction to one hundred lashes, which it said was the penalty for breaking the law prohibiting premarital sex, and canceled the eighty lashes handed down for falsely accusing the men involved of forcing her to have sex with them. Despite the pending appeal of her case, Magazu was lashed a hundred times on Friday morning, January 19, 2001.  Human Rights Watch urged the Nigerian government to review its legal processes to ensure that all cases, including those in Sharia courts, are dealt with in accordance with due process of the law as set out in international human rights standards and the Nigerian constitution.

By putting at risk these organizations' ability to serve their clients, this policy curtails their ability to offer all appropriate medical care and fully exercise their right to free expression.

On January 19, rival Lendu and Hema militias killed at least one hundred and fifty civilians in the northeastern Congo town of Bunia. Uganda is one of six foreign governments that have intervened in the civil war in the Congo (DRC) where its troops now control a sizable portion of the northeast. """"Foreign troops should not be taking sides in Congo's civil war,"""" said Alison Des Forges, consultant to the Africa Division of Human Rights Watch. """"But if they are there, they should certainly not be complicit in attacks against civilians. The perpetrators should be apprehended and punished.""""  The outbreak of violence does not appear to be connected to the recent death of Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the transition of power to his son, Joseph Kabila. But it does further destabilize northeastern Congo at a time of uncertainty in the capital of Kinshasa.  Militia of the Lendu and affiliated Ngiti people attacked near the Bunia airport at dawn, carrying to the provincial capital the violence which has taken scores of lives in villages to the south of Bunia in the last three weeks. One of their objectives was apparently to disable a Ugandan helicopter that had been used to attack them in the earlier conflicts. The militiamen, who attacked with bows and arrows and spears, were driven back by the Ugandans using heavy weapons. The Lendu and Ngiti militia then attacked Hema families in several residential areas, killing more than fifty and wounding another twenty. In reprisal killings later in the day, Hema militia wielding machetes searched houses in Lendu areas and killed more than one hundred people.  Representatives of humanitarian organizations were reluctant to go to the assistance of victims because extremists have recently accused them of taking sides in the dispute or even of supplying arms to one of the rival groups.  Some local observers believe that Ugandan support for the Hema, a local minority group related to the Hima of Uganda, has aggravated the long-standing ethnic conflict. According to early reports from local residents, Ugandan soldiers at first did nothing to stop the January 19 attacks and their commanding officer, Col. Edison Muzoora, failed to respond to pleas to halt the killing. Bunia residents belonging to none of the rival groups finally intervened to stop the slaughter. Only then or shortly after did Ugandan soldiers begin patrolling the streets to restore order.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda",""

The eight-page memorandum is based on almost one hundred interviews with Chechnya residents, who detailed human rights violations they endured or witnessed in the past six months. Many had been detained by Russian forces in sweep operations or at checkpoints for not having the right residence permit; one woman was hauled off because soldiers found a photograph of her in traditional dress, standing with a bearded man.  Russian forces frequently hold detainees in makeshift facilities such as pits in the ground or oil tanks. Detainees are routinely tortured-through severe beatings and, sometimes, electric shock. One man told us he was tortured throughout his five-week stay in a pit in August and September. Russian forces extort the relatives of detainees for bribes, sometimes thousands of dollars, in exchange for their loved ones.  Many Chechens simply disappear in Russian custody, with their corpses turning up in unmarked graves weeks or months later. Armed men in masks believed to be Russian security forces burst into homes at night, hauling off young men who are never heard from again.

He defended his regime in a second war after his erstwhile allies, Rwanda and Uganda, invaded the country in 1998. In this second war, Kabila's forces, like those of Rwanda, Uganda, and the Congolese rebels allied with them, have all engaged in indiscriminate attacks on civilians, extrajudicial executions, rape, and destruction of property, with the result of massive displacement of population.  During his nearly four years in power, Kabila regularly and ruthlessly violated the human rights of the Congolese people, killing, torturing, imprisoning, and causing the """"disappearance"""" of any who he thought threatened him or his regime. Among those who suffered most were political opponents, leaders of civil society, human rights activists, and journalists.     Kabila handed out rights to exploit the vast mineral riches of the country to his commercial and military cronies while the economy as a whole disintegrated and ordinary people lacked food, medicine, and other basic needs of life, particularly in Kinshasa and other urban areas.     Despite his abuses, Kabila held on to some support by portraying himself as a symbol of national resistance against the foreign forces that occupied eastern Congo. He profited from and his supporters encouraged hatred of the Tutsi, who were held responsible for the misconduct of the Rwandan army and its Congolese allies. He enjoyed the support of troops from his home region of Katanga, whom he in turn favored with regular pay and supplies. But other units, ordinarily left unpaid, preyed on citizens to support themselves.     With Kabila's death, a new government inherits a nation wracked by a war that has pulled in six neighboring nations and spawned three major rebel movements as well as numerous smaller armed opposition bands. International businessmen, many of them based outside the region, have milked the wealth of the Congo while their governments exert no effective pressure for peace. Only an end to hostilities, the interdiction of incursions into neighboring countries, and the withdrawal of foreign forces offers the possibility of averting worsening ethnic-based conflict, like that now flaring in the Rwandan-dominated region of South Kivu and in the Ugandan-dominated region of Ituri.     According to international humanitarian sources, more than 1.7 million Congolese have died as a result of the war. Kabila's death cannot guarantee an end to this carnage; that requires commitment by all belligerents as well as by the international community.     In addition, to move towards a state of law, the new government must:  End all interference with basic human rights, as provided for by international and national law, including freedom of expression, freedom of the press, and freedom of assembly.      Order a review of persons currently detained in prison and release those held without charge or credible suspicion of guilt      Investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity as well as murders, """"disappearances"""" and other acts of state terrorism against citizens      Declare and enforce respect for all Congolese regardless of ethnic or regional origin      End harassment of human rights groups and obstruction of human rights investigations  Kabila's death does not clear the record but rather creates the opportunity to insist on accountability for the crimes committed under his authority. In 1997 the U.N. Secretary-General sent a team to investigate war crimes committed by all parties during the first Congo war. Kabila blocked their work, but the investigators returned with enough information to conclude that combatants in the first Congo war had committed crimes against humanity and perhaps genocide. The Security Council asked the Congolese and Rwandan governments to continue the inquiry, but they did nothing. After the start of the second war, Kabila's government alleged that its former ally Rwanda was responsible for obstructing the U.N. investigation and pledged cooperation with future U.N. inquiries. The U.N. did nothing. The Security Council should now name a Commission of Experts to resume the earlier inquiry and also to examine subsequent alleged crimes against humanity committed by all belligerents in the Congo.","Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, Uganda","International Justice"

Bush should take to improve human rights in the United States and the world. """"Support for human rights in the world is firmly in the U.S. national interest and directly reflects the nation's highest ideals,"""" wrote Kenneth Roth, Executive Director of Human Rights Watch. """"Governments that resort to abuses to maintain their rule make unreliable partners for the United States.""""  Among the recommendations of Human Rights Watch:  -- press for the arrest of the top figures indicted for war crimes in the Balkans, including former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic, and Ratko Mladic. The impunity enjoyed by the architects of the Balkan wars could give hope to nationalists who seek to undermine reconciliation and reform.  -- condition any further aid to Colombia's armed forces on strict respect for human rights. Colombia has failed to meet a single human rights condition required by the last year's $1.3 billion aid package, but President Clinton has waived these conditions and gone ahead with the aid.  -- use """"sustained political pressure"""" on China to improve its human rights situation. Dialogue, trade, and investment in China do not automatically guarantee human rights improvements when China is restricting internet access, imprisoning peaceful dissidents, and making only limited efforts at legal reforms.  -- condition federal aid to U.S. police and corrections departments on improvements in curbing brutality and to support inquiries by the Department of Justice into police departments which have tolerated patterns of abuse.  -- maintain the restrictions on the recruitment of human rights abusers by U.S. intelligence agencies. A congressional panel recently recommended loosening those restrictions, although recent years have seen several embarrassing revelations that foreign officials responsible for murder, torture, and """"disappearance,"""" have been on the CIA payroll.  Human Rights Watch noted that the apparent assassination of President Laurent Kabila of the Democratic Republic of Congo underscored the volatility of that African giant wracked by a civil war which involves six other countries. As successive waves of atrocities have gone unpunished, the group asserted, all sides in that war have acted against civilians with increasing licence. It called for a United Nations Commission of inquiry into abuses there. """"The mere act of deploying such a team on the ground could save lives, and would send a message that the world is determined not to let atrocities be committed in obscurity,"""" wrote Roth.  The group especially pressed the incoming president to act against injustices in the United States. """"The United States cannot effectively champion human rights abroad if it ignores them at home,"""" said the letter.

Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi-Shahroudi","01/16/2001","Human Rights Watch condemns the arbitrary and harsh sentences handed down by a Revolutionary Court in Tehran on Saturday January 13, 2001 against seven of the seventeen defendants being tried for attending an international conference in Berlin, Germany, in April 2000.  We believe there is no basis to the charges that they """"conspired to overthrow the system of the Islamic Republic"""" and that they are victims of a politically-motivated prosecution intended to discredit the cause of political reform, to punish leading reformists, to intimidate independent thinkers, and to chill dissent.  The defendants participated openly in an international conference at which they contributed information concerning developments in Iran. In so doing, they were exercising their fundamental right to freedom of expression and to impart and receive information, rights that are protected under international treaty law to which Iran is a state party. Article 19 (2) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) states:  Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of his choice.  There has been no suggestion that the participants from Iran attending the Berlin conference had any part in protests against the Iranian government that took place at that time. Their statements at the conference were reported in the Iranian media at the time. In an open letter sent to Your Excellency on November 2, 2000, Human Rights Watch expressed concern that the defendants would not receive a fair trial in accordance with Article 14 of the ICCPR. These concerns have not been allayed. Many of the hearings in this trial took place in secret, and defense lawyers were not provided with information about the prosecution case.  Human Rights Watch is particularly concerned by the severity of the sentences handed down on these seven non-violent independent activists. Investigative journalist, Akbar Ganji, received a ten-year sentence to be followed by five years of internal exile in the south of Iran. His jailing appears designed to punish him for his activities as a journalist exposing the alleged involvement of leaders of the Islamic Republic in acts of gross violations of human rights.  Two translators employed by the German Embassy, Saeed Sadr and Khalil Rostamkhani, received ten and nine-year sentences respectively. Mr. Rostamkhani did not even attend the Berlin conference, although he was involved in its preparation. His wife, Roshanak Darioush, a prominent translator of German literature into Persian, served as a translator at the conference, but has not returned to Iran to face charges.  Other prominent reformist figures subjected to prison terms include student leader Ali Afshari, five years; veteran politician Ezzatollah Sahabi, four and a half years. Both of them were already detained last month on new charges relating to their criticism of government policy. Their families are unaware of their places of detention.  Two women's rights activists, publisher Shahla Lahidji and lawyer Mehrangiz Kar, each received four year sentences. Ms. Kar, recently diagnosed with breast cancer, has sought to leave the country in order to obtain treatment but has been banned from travel.  Another accused participant in the Berlin conference, Hojatoleslam Hassan Youssefi Eshkevari, remains in prison awaiting sentencing by a Special Court for the Clergy on charges of apostasy, which may carry the death penalty. Two other writers, Changiz Pahlevan and Kazem Kardavani, have not returned to Iran from Germany, having been informed that charges have been prepared against them also.  Three other defendants were fined or given suspended sentences. Seven were acquitted. The ten convicted defendants thus received highly divergent sentences for essentially the same offense, indicating that the court employed arbitrary criteria in deciding on sentences.  In conclusion, the charges against these individuals are transparently political and should never have been lodged against them. Their conditions of pretrial detention and the trials themselves were conducted in flagrant violation of international standards. For these reasons, Human Rights Watch urges Your Excellency you to rectify this travesty of justice by ensuring that these convictions are appealable to a higher body whose procedures comply with international standards and thus allow these unjust convictions and sentences by the Revolutionary Court to be overturned. We further call on Your Excellency to put an end to the manipulation of Iran's judiciary for political ends, and to ensure that individuals are not persecuted for exercising their protected right to freedom of expression.

Bush told Boeing aircraft workers, """"When I am president, China will know that America's values are always part of America's agenda. Our advocacy of human rights is not a formality of diplomacy. It is a fundamental commitment of our country."""" One meaningful way President-elect Bush can make good on that commitment once he's in office is to give a high priority to setting up a congressional-executive commission on human rights in China -- and to make sure it has teeth. The bill enacted last year granting China permanent normal trade relations required the establishment of such a body, modeled after a similar commission set up in the 1970's to press the former Soviet Union and its East European bloc allies for compliance of the Helsinki accords. The new commission is charged specifically with monitoring and promoting human rights, labor rights and religious freedom in China. But applying this model to China won't be easy. Beijing isn't a party to an agreement like the Helsinki pact. And China's leaders have already vigorously attacked the idea of the commission, vowing they won't cooperate.  As China prepares to join the World Trade Organization later this year, prospects for significant human rights improvements appear slim. The likelihood of more worker and rural unrest is high and the Communist Party is already intensifying its crackdown on unofficial religious groups. New restrictions have been placed on use of the Internet -- a tool for the country's economic development, but for the Party leadership also a worrisome vehicle to incite """"subversion."""" In creating the new commission, the PNTR law requires Mr. Bush to appoint five members, one each from the State Department, and Labor and Commerce departments, plus two at-large members. The House and Senate will also choose nine members each. A commission packed with China-bashers will have no hope of sending high-level delegations to China in advance of Mr. Bush's expected visit to Shanghai this October for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. And getting observers into China to monitor trials or promote legal reforms will also be a non-starter. On the other hand, a toothless commission charged with issuing an annual report assessing human rights that is put on the shelf and promptly ignored, won't work either. The White House should move quickly, therefore, together with Congress, to appoint a balanced, credible commission that includes members with influence who Beijing can't easily ignore, as well as those with a proven track record on human rights and workers' rights. Furthermore, they should push for legislation that greatly increases the commission's paltry budget ($500,000) for staffing and activities this year. Even more crucial is for Mr. Bush to take the lead in proposing that the commission's recommendations for policy actions be subject to an annual debate and vote in Congress. Obviously the new administration needs a human rights policy that goes beyond the commission in order to exert significant pressure on Beijing. But focusing on getting this commission up and running serves several purposes. It provides a new tool for addressing human rights concerns. It provides a useful forum for congressional and White House partnership on a critical foreign policy issue. And it will show that the Bush administration is willing to go beyond empty rhetoric on human rights of the """"trade promotes freedom"""" variety that Mr. Bush himself has so frequently invoked. The new president can set the right tone in his relations with China early on in his administration by making it clear he won't sacrifice human rights to security or economic concerns. Mr. Bush must take principled, pragmatic action to back up his campaign rhetoric. This is one way to start.  Mike Jendrzejczyk is Washington, D.C.

Chilean courts have managed to prosecute cases of the """"disappeared"""" despite the 1978 decree granting amnesty to the armed forces for such crimes. The courts have used a jurisprudential rule that establishes a """"disappearance"""" as a continuing crime -- one that extends beyond the period of military rule because the victims have never been found and therefore the criminal act is still underway. Some have argued that information on the victims' deaths means the amnesty decree should terminate ongoing prosecutions.  Human Rights Watch said that the information provided by the military was cryptic, and far too sparse in most cases to allow the courts to verify it. While the place where the bodies were dumped is approximated, there are no details regarding the date when the prisoners or their corpses were disposed of, whether boats or air transport were used, how the prisoners met their deaths, or what happened to their bodies after they were killed.  """"It is a step forward for the armed forces to have finally owned up to what they must have known all along,"""" said Jos?Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"But without independent confirmation, no judges worth their salt could possibly close an investigation on the basis of this information. To award officers an amnesty when there is still no proof of death other than the armed forces' word would add insult to the anguish of the relatives.""""  The armed forces recently released a report describing the fate of 200 victims, in fulfillment of a government-sponsored agreement with human rights lawyers signed last June. Among the report's revelations was that the armed forces dumped the bodies of more than 150 prisoners into the ocean, rivers and lakes of Chile. Most of the cases included in the armed forces' list date from the first six months of the military government, before the repression was placed in the hands of a centralized apparatus, the secret police known as the DINA.  """"The information is a devastating confirmation of the armed forces' responsibility for horrifying atrocities,"""" said Vivanco. """"It is particularly important as it represents the first details the armed forces have ever given about their terrible crimes, which have left deep scars in Chile.""""  Human Rights Watch urged President Lagos to take further steps to find the missing information, and to clarify the fate of hundreds of prisoners who """"disappeared"""" after their abduction by the DINA, which responded ultimately to General Pinochet alone. To do this, the government must search for new methods to ensure cooperation, such as penalizing those who conceal information, or providing benefits to those who cooperate, while taking care that the courts are given the resources and support they need to investigate these horrific crimes and bring those responsible to justice.","Americas, Chile","International Justice"

If extradited, Cavallo will face prosecution under the jurisdiction of Spanish Judge Balthazar Garzón, known for his prosecution of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. With this landmark decision, Mexico becomes the first Latin American country to apply the principle of universal jurisdiction for human rights violations in an extradition context. """"This is a major step forward for human rights in the region,"""" said José Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch. """"This case is further proof that the Pinochet prosecution has created real momentum in favor of the criminal prosecution of egregious human rights abuses."""" The fate of the extradition request now rests with the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations, Jorge Castañeda. Although the court's ruling sets out a legal basis for the extradition, Castañeda must make the ultimate decision to send Cavallo to Spain. """"The foreign minister has said that Mexico would commit itself to strengthening the international human rights regime,"""" said Vivanco. """"Now is the opportunity to show that he is serious by extraditing Cavallo."""" Cavallo is the second Argentine to be detained abroad for human rights crimes committed in Argentina during the country's 1976-1983 military dictatorship. (The first was retired Major Jorge Olivera, who was detained in Rome last year and then released due to mistakes made by the Italian courts.) Cavallo was arrested in Cancun last August, as he attempted to catch a plane to Buenos Aires. Until his arrest, he had lived and worked in Mexico, serving as the director of the National Registry of Motor vehicles. According to a November 1999 indictment issued by Spanish Judge Garzón, Cavallo, known by the name of Miguel Angel Cavallo, was a Navy lieutenant who worked in the notorious Navy Mechanics School (Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada, ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the military regime. Between January 1977 and October 1978, the indictment states, Cavallo belonged to the operations sector of Working Group 3.3.2, a group actively involved in kidnapping and torturing persons perceived as leftist by the military. The indictment names Cavallo as a participant in the torture of Thelma Jara de Cabezas, and the execution of Mónica Jauregui and Elba Delia Aldaya. The 1984 report of the Argentine truth commission names 8,961 people who """"disappeared"""" under the military dictatorship, noting that this figure is not exhaustive. Although some high-level officials were criminally prosecuted in the 1980s for these abuses, the vast majority of military perpetrators were covered by the country's amnesty laws, while pardons issued by then-President Menem in 1989 and 1990 freed those who had been convicted.

Nimet Tanrikulu, former president of the Istanbul branch of the Human Rights Association of Turkey (HRA) was formally arrested Monday for participating in a non-violent demonstration against recent transfers of prisoners into isolation units at Turkey's new F-type high-security prisons.  """"The Turkish government is trying to hide grievous violations. These people deserve to be listened to, not gagged and locked up,"""" said Jonathan Sugden, the Human Rights Watch researcher for Turkey. Sugden is currently in Ankara investigating allegations of beatings and torture during the December prison transfers.  Since the transfer, the Turkish Human Rights Association has been attempting to collect evidence from prisoners, lawyers and released prisoners about the December 19 transfers. A paper the HRA published on Saturday contains evidence and testimony of severe beatings in gendarmerie transports, and beating and ritual humiliation on arrival at the F-type prisons in Edirne, Kocaeli and Ankara. The HRA has also tracked the regime of extreme isolation imposed on the more than one thousand inmates held in solitary and three-person units. In consequence the human rights group has been targeted for intense official pressure.  The Human Rights Watch representative, Mr. Sugden, was present on Monday when plainclothes police officers entered the national headquarters of the HRA in Ankara to question Husnu Ondul, association president, about a press briefing he had given earlier in the day. Husnu Ondul later told Human Rights Watch, """"Here I am, with five of my branches shut down in the past six weeks-all because of our work on the prisons, without a doubt. My people are detained or raided almost every day?We are living in some of the worst days in the history of the association."""" The Human Rights Association was founded in 1986.  Husnu Ondul also complained that the association was receiving constant threats by telephone. Ankara local branch president Lutfi Demirkapi told HRW about a threatening phone call he received on January 5, when an unknown caller asked, """"Are you still alive then? They are getting your shroud ready?""""  Such threats are taken seriously by the HRA, which has lost ten members in armed attacks over the past decade. In 1998 its president Akin Birdal was nearly fatally wounded in such an attack. The bullet-scarred door of his office stands in the Ankara branch as a reminder.  """"The attack on Birdal was prompted by unfounded official allegations. We are concerned because I have seen and heard similar allegations against the HRA while carrying out my investigations here,"""" said Sugden. """"Under the U.N. Declaration on Human Rights Defenders, these people have not only a right, but a duty to document the truth about violations when they occur. It is the Turkish government's duty to protect and encourage human rights activists in their work, not to persecute them.""""  In the wake of the prison raids, five branches of the HRA have been closed-Izmir, Van, Gaziantep, Malatya, and Konya. On December 17, the Istanbul branch was raided and board members detained for several hours.  On January 6, Lutfi Demirkapi, president of the Ankara local branch of the HRA, was detained while attempting to make a press statement next to the human rights monument in the city center. He told Human Rights Watch: """"I was grabbed by police officers and put in a police van with relatives of prisoners held at Ankara's Sincan F-type prison. The police kicked and beat the others.

Representatives of the groups are currently in Turkey to research the operation conducted in 20 prisons in December 2000 and to investigate conditions at the new F-type prisons to which many of the prisoners were transferred. At least 29 prisoners and two soldiers died in the operation. The researchers have spoken with doctors, lawyers who visited the new prisons, relatives of prisoners and three prisoners who had been released from the F-type prisons.  These sources consistently indicate that the prisoners were beaten and some tortured before, during and after the transfers to the new prisons. It is alleged that prisoners were stripped and subjected to rape with a truncheon on arrival at Kandira F-type prison near Izmit, but the claims could not be corroborated because lawyers' requests for forensic examinations to be carried out received no response.  All reports confirm that a regime of solitary and small group isolation is being imposed in the new F-type prisons-in breach of Justice Ministry undertakings. Many prisoners have gone without human contact for days, apart from roll-calls which were frequently accompanied by violence. Some prisoners in solitary isolation have not been seen by anyone from the outside world since mid-December.  Prisoners were not permitted into the small exercise yard attached to the individual cells until the last few days. To the knowledge of Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, none of the prisoners in the F-type prisons have been brought out of their units for recreation, proper exercise or sport, nor have they been permitted to associate with other prisoners. The prisoners have also complained that very loud music has been piped into the corridors outside the units.  """"Our investigations suggest that transferred prisoners have been held in isolation and have been tortured or ill-treated,"""" said the researchers from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. """"The torture of a human being is an act of cruelty that is prohibited by international human rights law. Isolation can cause physical and mental harm and may amount to cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment. The Turkish government is accountable and must put an immediate stop to these abuses.""""  Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch sought talks with the Justice Ministry as well as access to the prisons, but on both counts the requests were refused. They did meet with representatives of the Human Rights Commission of the Turkish Parliament and the Human Rights Association. At least 300 prisoners are on hunger strike, and many have been fasting for more than 70 days. It appears likely that deaths will occur in the next few days. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are very alarmed at the recent developments in the Turkish prison system, and urgently recommend that the Turkish government ensures: access to prisons by lawyers and independent doctors in order to examine the allegations of torture and ill-treatment, and to provide necessary medical care. that the regime of intense small group and solitary isolation in the F-type prisons be lifted, and doors to prisoner units be left open during the day to permit prisoners within each small cluster of units to associate. broad access to representatives of bar, medical and human rights associations to ensure that the new prisons are run in accordance with Turkish law and international standards for the humane treatment of prisoners. The groups also urge the Council of Europe with its expertise in the area of prison management to take an active interest in the crisis.","Europe/Central Asia, Türkiye",""
"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/01/04/letter-united-nations-security-council","Letter to United Nations Security Council","Letter to United Nations Security Council ","","01/04/2001","New York, January 4, 2000 Ambassador Richard Holbrooke President of the United Nations Security Council Permanent Mission of the United States to the United Nations 799 United Nations Plaza New York, NY 10017 - 3505   Dear Ambassador Holbrooke,  As the Security Council continues to grapple with the question of Iraq's compliance with its international obligations, Human Rights Watch is writing to urge you to take further steps to respond to the ongoing humanitarian emergency there. Resolution 1284, adopted on December 17, 1999, includes some welcome features in this regard, but it by no means addresses the full extent of the crisis. We believe there is a pressing need for additional initiatives in order to reconcile more effectively the enforcement of the objectives articulated in Resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991) with the humanitarian obligation of the Council and its member states to minimize harm to civilians and to ensure protection of their fundamental rights under international law.  The late March 1999 report of the Council's """"humanitarian panel"""" (Annex II of S/1999/356), the Secretary-General's two-year review of the """"oil-for-food"""" program issued on April 28, 1999 (S/1999/481), and the results of the UNICEF survey of child and maternal mortality released in August raise serious human rights and humanitarian concerns. These reports, as well as those from other humanitarian agencies in the field such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, make clear that life-threatening conditions continue to prevail in Iraq, stemming from a pervasive and protracted public health emergency. This emergency is largely a consequence of the destruction of the civilian economic infrastructure in the 1991 Gulf war, repair of which has been severely impeded by the comprehensive embargo on Iraqi exports and imports. Restoration of the civilian economic infrastructure is essential to returning child mortality rates and other public health indicators to the levels and trajectories that existed prior to the embargo and war. Although the """"oil-for-food"""" humanitarian relief program authorized under Resolutions 986 (1995) and now expanded under Resolution 1284 (1999) provides materials for infrastructure repair, as a temporary relief program it does not encompass the planning and investment required to restore Iraq's infrastructure to a level needed to meet the most basic civilian necessities.  As an organization that has extensively documented war crimes and atrocities committed by the government of Iraq, Human Rights Watch is fully aware of the need for strong international measures to constrain and hold accountable those responsible for such crimes. We recognize, moreover, that the policies of the government�its failure to comply fully with Resolution 687, its refusal to implement any """"oil-for-food"""" arrangement between 1991 and 1996, its mixed record of cooperation since then, and its use of scarce available resources for non-humanitarian purposes in order to redirect the consequences of sanctions away from itself and onto vulnerable civilians�have greatly compounded and magnified the humanitarian crisis. It is apparent that the Iraqi government has not complied with its obligations under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to use """"the maximum of its available resources,"""" including """"international assistance,"""" to provide an adequate standard of living and improve living standards.  The past ten years have made clear that the Iraqi government has no intention of making the humanitarian interests of the Iraqi people its first priority. The government's callous and manipulative disregard for its humanitarian obligations is not something the Council can reasonably expect will change. Rather, it is a reality the Council must take into account in deciding the appropriate means for securing the government's compliance with its disarmament demands.  Charges that Iraqi malfeasance and incompetence are entirely responsible for the severity and extent of the humanitarian crisis, moreover, are not credible. The Council should not use the high degree of Iraqi government culpability for the humanitarian crisis to obscure its own share of responsibility. The severe deprivations and widespread pauperization facing the great majority of Iraqis today cannot be dissociated from the unprecedentedly comprehensive and protracted character of the embargo. The Council should not continue the sanctions without substantial modification, in order to address the continuing humanitarian crisis and the inadequacy of the current humanitarian program. In trying to curtail Iraq's development of weapons of mass destruction, the Council must devise means that do not aggravate the poverty and suffering of ordinary Iraqis, suffering that the government appears to find tolerable, even useful. In deploying instruments of coercion, including non-military instruments such as an embargo, the Council must be governed by the core humanitarian principle of minimizing threats to life and bodily harm of innocent people who bear no responsibility for the government policies being sanctioned.  Human Rights Watch therefore urges the Council to take the following steps to address Iraq's humanitarian crisis while targeting more directly the military ambitions of the Iraqi government and holding high government officials accountable for well-documented criminal actions: First: Address urgent humanitarian needs by implementing the recommendations of the Council's humanitarian panel promptly and without condition. Some of these have been incorporated into Resolution 1284 (1999), although in a form that requires further action by the Security Council or the sanctions committee. The Council has an absolute duty to address these urgent humanitarian needs without regard to the debate over the most effective way to secure Iraq's compliance with the Council's demands. Second: Restructure the sanctions regime, so as to minimize its impact on the civilian population, by permitting the import of civilian goods and investments in the country's economy while strengthening prohibitions on imports of a military nature. The damage to Iraq's physical and social infrastructure and the acutely distressed income levels of most of the population will continue to limit the beneficial impact of a program restricted to humanitarian commodities.  Third: Establish an international criminal tribunal to try Iraqi government officials and former officials for whom credible evidence exists of responsibility for war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity, and provide sufficient resources and authority for such a tribunal to discharge its responsibilities. Establishment of such a tribunal, in addition to being entirely warranted in its own right, will help clarify that addressing Iraq's humanitarian crisis does not imply leniency or concessions toward the Iraqi government and responsible officials.  Fourth: Instruct the committee set up by Resolution 661 (1990) to oversee the Iraq sanctions (the sanctions committee) to conduct its operations with greater transparency and to monitor closely the humanitarian impact of the sanctions. Until now the Council's steps to meet its acknowledged responsibility to monitor these humanitarian effects have been inadequate. The lack of transparency in the committee's operations, in the context of the ability of a single member to block decisions, has raised legitimate concerns about politicization of the process for addressing humanitarian needs. Addressing urgent humanitarian needs: Reports from U.N. humanitarian agencies and credible independent organizations such as the ICRC highlight a continuing dire humanitarian situation in Iraq. The humanitarian panel established by the Security Council in January 1999 summarized the information at its disposal as pointing """"to a continuing degradation of the Iraqi economy with an acute deterioration in the living conditions of the Iraqi population and severe strains on its social fabric"""" (para. 43). The panel stressed that while not all of the suffering could be imputed to sanctions alone, """"the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war"""" (para. 45).  The humanitarian panel set out a number of recommendations which in our view constitute the minimum steps required to address the humanitarian crisis. Resolution 1284 (1999) implemented one of these directly and immediately, namely the removal of any dollar ceiling on oil exports, thus allowing increased funding of the Iraq humanitarian program. Such increased funding, however, will be contingent on international oil prices remaining at the level reached in the last half of 1999 and Iraq's ability, given the dilapidated state of its production facilities, to continue exporting oil at its present peak capacity rate of around 2.2 million barrels per day. The resolution does not take on a related panel recommendation to authorize production sharing or other investment arrangements by foreign oil firms that could provide, outside of oil-for-food revenues, the equipment and maintenance needed to rehabilitate these facilities, although it does request the Secretary-General to appoint a group of oil industry and other experts to develop recommendations regarding this proposal within 100 days.  The resolution also encourages states and international organizations to provide """"published material of an educational character to Iraq,"""" a step that is vital in order to reduce the extreme isolation of Iraqi educators and health professionals in particular.  The resolution addresses two other key recommendations of the panel, although in a manner that makes their implementation contingent on further steps by the Council or the sanctions committee. First, paragraph 17 directs the sanctions committee to """"pre-approve"""" humanitarian items on the basis of lists to be submitted by the Secretary-General. Such items, once the lists are approved, would be subject to approval by the Secretariat and no longer be required to come before the Sanctions Committee. Second, paragraph 24 requests the Secretary-General """"to make the necessary arrangements, subject to Security Council approval,"""" to allow oil-for-food funds to be used to purchase local products as well as to train Iraqi workers and professionals and to compensate them for installation and maintenance of items funded by the humanitarian program. U.N. humanitarian agencies on the ground have for a number of years pressed for the provision of such a """"cash component,"""" until now entirely absent in the government-controlled area. Given the sharp politicization that has in the recent past attended the Iraq-related deliberations of the Council and the sanctions committee, and the fact that these proposals have been under discussion for many months, we earnestly hope that both will be implemented without further delay. These recommendations should not be treated as bargaining chips to be implemented only on condition of Iraqi government cooperation. Rather, they are the least that the Security Council must do to fulfill its own humanitarian obligations stemming from this conflict. They embody the assessment of U.N. humanitarian agencies in the field regarding what steps are required to meet vital civilian needs. These recommendations should be implemented independently of other steps the Council may take to secure Iraqi government compliance with the demands contained in Resolutions 687 (1991) and 688 (1991).  Minimizing civilian impact: The humanitarian panel concluded in its report that """"the humanitarian situation in Iraq will continue to be a dire one in the absence of a sustained revival of the Iraqi economy, which in turn cannot be achieved solely through remedial humanitarian efforts"""" (para. 58). Implementation of the recommendations of the humanitarian panel will build on the achievements of the oil-for-food program in addressing immediate threats to the lives and physical integrity of ordinary Iraqis, but this humanitarian program does not contain the elements of comprehensive planning and economic revival that we believe are essential in order to reverse the dangerously degraded state of the country's civilian infrastructure and social services. Human Rights Watch therefore urges the Council to restructure the Iraq embargo so as to permit the import of civilian goods and investments in the civilian economy, while maintaining strict prohibitions on imports of a military nature.  The Iraqi government has had, and will continue to have, access to foreign exchange from smuggling and from the remittances of Iraqis living and working abroad. This access will certainly increase under the reforms we advocate here. We do believe, however, that a more inclusive monitoring of imports such as we propose can in part address the concern of the Council to prevent the government from developing weapons of mass destruction. There is no way to ensure completely that this greater access to foreign exchange will not be used for non-humanitarian or even prohibited purposes. We would point out that present arrangements under the total embargo also do not foreclose this possibility. The goods Iraq now imports using its existing foreign exchange resources are presently not subject to inspection: only items imported under the oil-for-food program are inspected upon entry, to see that they conform to approved contract specifications. We therefore recommend increasing international scrutiny of commodities entering Iraq, while removing prohibitions on the import of non-military goods and financial transactions. The key elements of a restructured embargo would include the following:  Removal of restrictions on the import of commodities that are not on the List of Dual Use Goods and Technologies and the Munitions List of the Wassenaar Arrangement or on the Schedules of Chemicals of the Chemical Weapons Convention.   Continued prohibition of all imports and exports of a clearly military nature.  Continued close but transparent scrutiny by the Sanctions Committee of contracts to import items that have """"dual-use"""" applications.  Removal of restrictions on financial transactions involving civilian sectors of the economy, including foreign investments. Making all imported goods liable to international inspection at all Iraqi ports of entry in order to monitor compliance regarding restrictions on military and dual-use imports.  These recommendation would shift the emphasis from seeking to block all Iraqi government access to foreign exchange, and in the process continuing to choke the entire Iraqi economy, to preventing Iraq from importing military and dual-use commodities. We recognize that making all imports liable to inspection at ports of entry would incur substantial expense. This should be funded out of Iraq's export revenues, much as U.N. operations, including UNSCOM, have been funded since 1991. To the extent that Iraq does not permit such inspections in return for lifting non-military parts of the embargo, this proposal would require the consent of Iraq's immediate neighbors�Turkey, Iran, and Jordan. All three countries have, to varying degrees, argued for lifting of the comprehensive embargo, and would reap considerable benefits from the re-establishment of trade with Iraq, even if that trade includes an inspections regime. Any effective coercive measure of this sort involves high costs. Until now, those costs have been borne disproportionately by ordinary Iraqis, to the detriment of their lives and well-being. Our proposal is to focus the sanctions in order to reduce substantially the severe collateral impact on the Iraqi population.  Holding Iraq's leaders accountable: Human Rights Watch urges the Council to establish an international criminal tribunal, such as the tribunals the Council has created to address criminal accountability in former Yugoslavia and in Rwanda, to examine available evidence regarding the responsibility of Iraq's leaders for war crimes, genocide, and crimes against humanity, and to bring those responsible to justice. The investigation should include the genocidal 1988 campaign to evacuate the Kurdish countryside, the so-called Anfal campaign, as well as war crimes during the occupation of Kuwait and crimes against humanity that have been credibly reported during the period from the Gulf war up to the present. The Council should provide all necessary resources for the Tribunal to fulfill its mandate in a timely and effective manner.  The Council should also request all countries to cooperate in arresting and bringing to justice in national courts Iraqi officials and former officials who appear within their national frontiers and for whom probable cause of responsibility for such crimes can be established.  Monitoring Humanitarian Impact: Under Resolution 666 (1990), the Council insisted that it alone would determine whether """"humanitarian circumstances"""" had arisen, and instructed the sanctions committee to keep the situation under """"constant review."""" Neither the Council nor the Committee has done this since July 1991, when the Council received the report on humanitarian needs in Iraq from Sadruddin Aga Khan, the Secretary-General's special representative. Those members who have been the strongest proponents of continued sanctions have disparaged reports by specialized U.N. and other humanitarian agencies in the field but have not sought to develop more reliable or accurate accounts. The Notes of the president of the Council on """"The Work of the Sanctions Committee,"""" issued on January 29, 1999 (S/1999/92), expressed the consensus of the Council that """"sanctions committees should monitor, throughout the sanctions regime, the humanitarian impact of sanctions on vulnerable groups..."""" In the case of Iraq, this recommendation has yet to be taken up.  Paragraph 28 of Resolution 1284 (1999), which requests the Secretary-General to report on the progress made in meeting humanitarian needs, appears to meet this monitoring obligation only partially. Human Rights Watch strongly urges the Council to establish an independent framework and mechanism for monitoring the humanitarian impact of sanctions imposed under its authority. This on-going evaluation should include in this case an independent assessment of the effectiveness of the U.N.'s humanitarian program, and the problems and complexities associated with that program. An impartial humanitarian body, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, might be best positioned to carry out such a task. Another approach would be to create a Special Rapporteur whose mandate includes scrutiny of practices of both the Security Council and the government of Iraq as those pertain to the humanitarian circumstances of the population.  While Resolution 1284 (1999) includes several measures to facilitate more timely decisions by the sanctions committee, the Council should also instruct the committee to introduce greater transparency into its deliberations by making available information concerning its decisions and explanations for rejections and holds placed on applications.  In conclusion, we urge the Council to implement this set of recommendations in order to address more satisfactorily the humanitarian consequences of the sanctions regime it has authorized. The United States, the most adamant proponent of comprehensive sanctions, has frequently asserted that """"we have never had a quarrel with the Iraqi people,"""" to cite Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's words. But this embargo, unprecedented in its comprehensiveness and now well into its tenth year, has taken an enormous toll on Iraqi lives and had a ruinous impact on Iraqi society. It may be argued that the embargo, because it is not military in nature, does not require strict adherence to international humanitarian law. However, the most basic humanitarian principles must be taken into account in the application of coercive measures that affect the well being of a civilian population. We believe the Council has an obligation to address the question of whether it is appropriate to continue to impose severe hardship and bodily harm on civilians through means short of war that it would be prohibited from imposing in time of war.  I have taken the liberty of also addressing this letter to the New York-based representatives of the Security Council's other member states. We look forward to receiving a positive response at your earliest convenience. As always, Human Rights Watch stands ready to discuss our recommendations with you and with representatives of other member states, and we would be pleased to meet Your Excellency in furtherance of this aim.

Marzouki, a professor of medicine and veteran human rights activist, was convicted on the basis of statements he signed as spokesman of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), a rights group that the authorities have refused to recognize. Human Rights Watch also criticized the questioning yesterday of Slaheddine Jourchi, a vice-president of the Tunisian Human Rights League, by an investigating magistrate, and the recent imprisonment of another CNLT member, lawyer Nejib Hosni. A copy of the letter is below. ***  3 January 2001  President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali Preident de la Republique Palais Preidentiel Tunis Tunisia  Your Excellency,  We are writing to protest the conviction of Moncef Marzouki, spokesperson of the National Council on Liberties in Tunisia (CNLT), and other recent measures that are aimed at stifling independent human rights activity in your country.  On December 30, the Court of First Instance in Tunis sentenced Dr. Marzouki to one year in prison on charges of """"belonging to an illegal association"""" (in this case the internationally respected CNLT) and """"disseminating false news with the intent of disturbing the public order."""" The basis for this conviction is CNLT communiqu? deploring human rights conditions in Tunisia that were signed by Dr. Marzouki. The interior ministry refused the CNLT's application for legal recognition in 1999. Dr. Marzouki, who was imprisoned in 1994 for his political beliefs, is free pending a decision on whether to appeal. In July, the Ministry of Health arbitrarily fired him from his teaching post at the University of Sousse Faculty of Medicine. He is reportedly being followed by plainclothes police wherever he goes.  In our view, the charges for which Dr. Marzouki faces a term in prison contradict Tunisia's obligations under international law to uphold the rights to freedom of association and of expression. Regrettably, they have been used during your presidential tenure to imprison many peaceful human rights defenders and political dissidents.  In another disturbing development, we have received reports that CNLT member and human rights lawyer Mr. Nejib Hosni was transferred to a prison in Gabes, far from his home and family in Le Kef, only days before the date of his expected release from prison. Mr. Hosni was jailed on December 21 after receiving a fifteen-day sentence on dubious charges of """"illegally"""" practicing the legal profession. The Bar Council of Tunisia (Conseil National de l'Ordre des Avocats Tunisiens) took part in his defence.  We also note that yesterday, an investigating judge in Tunis questioned Mr. Slaheddine Jourchi, a vice president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), on possible charges of """"disseminating false news with the intent of disturbing the public order."""" The judicial investigation apparently stems from a December 11 LTDH communique signed by Mr. Jourchi about human rights issues.  Earlier in November, the activities of the LTDH were frozen and its offices shut by court order. This action was taken in response to a legal challenge to the LTDH internal elections in October that lead to a slate of independent-minded activists winning control of the league's steering committee. Mr. Jourchi, an incumbent vice-president, is on the victorious slate that is being challenged. Courts are to scheduled to examine aspects of that challenge on January 9 and 15.  The convictions of Moncef Marzouki and Nejib Hosni, and the investigation of Slaheddine Jourchi are in our view the latest evidence of a campaign on the part of your government to persecute human rights defenders as individuals and to cripple the independent organizations with which they are affiliated. We have written to you concerning previous incidents of harassment directed at human rights defenders, most recently on December 28, 2000.  We believe Mr. Hosni should be released from prison immediately and unconditionally. The politically motivated investigation of Mr. Jourchi should be dropped, and the convictions of both Mr. Hosni and Dr. Marzouki should be overturned. All three men should be allowed to exercise their rights to monitor and speak out on human rights issues without reprisal or prosecution, and to travel freely. Furthermore, we urge an end to the judicial and police harassment directed at the human rights organizations with which they are affiliated, so that these can continue to pursue freely their important work.  We thank you for your consideration and welcome your reply.

"https://www.hrw.org/news/2001/06/22/israel-sharon-investigation-urged","Israel- Sharon Investigation Urged","Israel: Sharon Investigation Urged","","06/22/2001","A criminal investigation into Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon´s role in the massacre of civilians in the Palestinian refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla should be launched, Human Rights Watch urged. The call by Human Rights Watch came as Prime Minister Sharon begins a visit to the United States. The Israeli leader´s visit here comes as controversy mounts in Europe over his responsibility for the 1982 killings. “There is abundant evidence that war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed on a wide scale in the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, but to date, not a single individual has been brought to justice,” said Hanny Megally, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa division of Human Rights Watch. “President Bush should urge Prime Minister Sharon to cooperate with any investigation.” As Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon had overall responsibility over the Israeli Defense Forces and allowed Phalangist militias to enter the camps where they terrorized the residents for three days. Human Rights Watch said that the United States had a substantial interest in the case because the Israeli occupation of West Beirut followed written U.S. assurances that Palestinians remaining there would be safe, as part of an arrangement that saw the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization forces. The debate in Europe erupted following a BBC documentary on the Sabra and Shatilla massacre, which was aired in the United Kingdom on June 17. The day after, survivors of the massacre lodged a complaint against Sharon in a Belgian court. During the BBC program, Morris Draper, the U.S. Special Envoy to the Middle East at the time, said that U.S. officials were horrified when told Sharon had allowed Phalange militias into West Beirut and the camps “because it would be a massacre.” He told the BBC that after the killings began he cabled Defense Minister Sharon, telling him, “You must stop the slaughter…. The situation is absolutely appalling. They are killing children. You have the field completely under your control and are therefore responsible for that area.” The Kahan Commission (named after the President of the Israeli Supreme Court) that investigated the massacre in 1983 concluded that “Minister of Defense [Sharon] bears personal responsibility” and should “draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office.” The commission recommended that Prime Minister Menachem Begin remove Sharon from office if he did not resign. Sharon did resign as minister of defense, though he subsequently assumed other cabinet positions. Annexes of the commission report have not yet been made public, and it is not known if they contain additional information specific to Sharon´s involvement. Human Rights Watch said that the findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, could not substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that would bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. Human Rights Watch recognizes that Sharon, in his capacity as Prime Minister, may invoke temporary immunity; however, that should not preclude an active criminal investigation into his conduct whether in Israel, or elsewhere. “Criminal investigations and prosecutions must include militia leaders like Elie Hobeika in Lebanon who carried out these atrocities,” Megally said. “But the Israeli government also has a responsibility to conduct an investigation into the actions of its own high officials who knew – and, in any case, certainly should have known -- that atrocities were likely to occur and did not act promptly to stop them once they knew the killing had started.” Background Details of the massacre: The massacre at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps occurred between September 16 and 18, 1982, after Israel Defense Forces (“IDF”) then occupying Beirut and under Ariel Sharon´s overall command as Israeli Defense Minister permitted members of the Phalange militia into the camps. The precise civilian death toll most likely will never be known. Israeli military intelligence estimated that between 700 and 800 people were killed in Sabra and Shatilla during the sixty-two-hour rampage, while Palestinian and other sources have claimed that the dead numbered up to several thousand. The victims included infants, children, women (including pregnant women), and the elderly, some of whom were mutilated or disemboweled before or after they were killed. Journalists who arrived on the scene immediately after the massacre also saw evidence of the summary execution of young men. To cite only one contemporaneous account, that of Thomas Friedman of the New York Times: “[M]ostly I saw groups of young men in their twenties and thirties who had been lined up against walls, tied by their hands and feet, and then mowed down gangland-style with fusillades of machine-gun fire.” By all accounts, the perpetrators of this indiscriminate slaughter were members of the Phalange (or Kata´eb, in Arabic) militia, a Lebanese force that was armed by and closely allied to Israel since the outbreak of Lebanon´s civil war in 1975. It must be noted, however, that the killings were carried out in an area under IDF control. An IDF forward command post was situated on the roof of a multi-story building located some 200 meters southwest of the Shatilla camp. Findings of the Kahan Commission: In February 1983, the three-member Israeli official independent commission of inquiry charged with investigating the events known as the Kahan Commission named former Defense Minister Sharon as one of the individuals who """"bears personal responsibility"""" for the Sabra and Shatilla massacre. Former Defense Minister Sharon´s decision to allow the Phalange into the camps: The Kahan Commission report detailed the direct role of former Defense Minister Sharon in allowing the Phalangists into the Sabra and Shatilla camps. For instance, then-Chief of Staff Lt.-Gen. Rafael Eitan testified that the entry of the Phalangists into the refugee camps was agreed upon between former Defense Minister Sharon and himself. Thereafter, former Defense Minister Sharon went to Phalangist headquarters and met with, among others, a number of Phalangist commanders. A document issued by former Defense Minister Sharon´s office containing “The Defense Minister´s Summary of 15 September 1982” states: “For the operation in the camps the Phalangists should be sent in.” That document also stated that “the I.D.F. shall command the forces in the area.” Former Defense Minister Sharon´s disregard of the consequences of that decision: As to former Defense Minister Sharon´s testimony that “no one had imagined the Phalangists would carry out a massacre in the camps,” the Kahan Commission concluded that “it is impossible to justify [Sharon´s] disregard of the danger of a massacre” because “no prophetic powers were required to know that a concrete danger of acts of slaughter existed when the Phalangists were moved into the camps without the I.D.F.´s being with them.” In fact, the Commission found: “In our view, everyone who had anything to do with events in Lebanon should have felt apprehension about a massacre in the camps, if armed Phalangist forces were to be moved into them without the I.D.F. exercising concrete and effective supervision and scrutiny of them…. To this backdrop of the Phalangists´ [enmity] toward the Palestinians [in the camps] were added the profound shock [of Bashir Jemayel´s recent death]….” The Kahan Commission further found that: If in fact the Defense Minister, when he decided that the Phalangists would enter the camps without the I.D.F. taking part in the operation, did not think that that decision could bring about the very disaster that in fact occurred, the only possible explanation for this is that he disregarded any apprehensions about what was to be expected because the advantages . . . to be gained from the Phalangists´ entry into the camps distracted him from the proper consideration in this instance. The Commission explained that “if the decision were taken with the awareness that the risk of harm to the inhabitants existed, the obligation existed to adopt measures which would ensure effective and ongoing supervision by the I.D.F. over the actions of the Phalangists at the site, in such a manner as to prevent the danger or at least reduce it considerably. The Defense Minister issued no order regarding the adoption of such measures.” The Commission concluded: “In our view, the Minister of Defense made a grave mistake when he ignored the danger of acts of revenge and bloodshed by the Phalangists against the population in the refugee camps.” As its ultimate recommendation, the Kahan Commission recommended that Sharon be discharged from serving as Minister of Defense, and that, if necessary, the then-Prime Minister should consider removing him from office. * * * Human Rights Watch takes the position that what happened at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee camps constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity, and that all those responsible need to be brought to justice. Enough questions are raised by the Kahan Commission report to warrant a criminal investigation by Israel into whether former Defense Minister Sharon and other Israeli military officials—including some who knew the massacre was occurring but took no actions to stop it—bear criminal responsibility. The findings and conclusions of the Kahan Commission, however authoritative in terms of investigation and documentation of the facts surrounding the massacre, cannot substitute for proceedings in a criminal court in Israel or elsewhere that will bring to justice those responsible for the killing of hundreds of innocent civilians. The Lebanese government should institute a similar investigation into the Sabra and Shatilla massacre.
